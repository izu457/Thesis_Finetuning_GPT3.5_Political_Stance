PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of the powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with Madagascar with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and this country. At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 19 June 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar. Objectives: the primary objective of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing opportunities to EU vessels in the fishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar, in line with the management measures adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation, namely the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and where relevant, in keeping within the limits of the available surplus. The general objective is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of Madagascar, in the interests of both parties. Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution, which is EUR 1 566 250 for each of the first two years of the Protocol and EUR 1 487 500 for each of the following two years, is based on: In the event of the annual amount of catches of the species referred to the Protocol exceeds the reference tonnage of 15 750 tonnes, the amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 55 during the first two years of the Protocol, and EUR 50 during the last two years for each additional tonne caught. However, the annual amount paid by the European Union in respect of access to Madagascar‚Äôs fishing zone shall not be more than twice the amount of the tonnage reference for the corresponding year. If the amounts caught by European Union vessels in Madagascar‚Äôs fishing zone exceed a quantity corresponding to twice that total annual amount, the amount due in respect of the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: New fishing opportunities: the new fishing opportunities and technical measures may be reviewed by mutual agreement within the Joint Committee. They may be adjusted by the Joint Committee insofar as the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the IOTC confirm that such adjustments guarantee the sustainable management of the fish species covered by this Protocol. In this case, the financial contribution shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis. Exploratory fishing surveys may be authorised in the Malagasy fishing zone to test the technical feasibility and economic viability of new fisheries. Duration of the Agreement: the new Protocol covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application ‚Äì i.e. from the date of its signature and 1 January 2015 at the earliest. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total financial envelope allocated to this Protocol amounts to EUR 6.602 million from 2015 to 2018, including administrative management costs and human resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations, known as the Doha Development Agenda in November 2001. The negotiations on trade facilitation were launched in July 2004, based on a commitment to clarify and improve several articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994): such as those concerning: (i) freedom of transit); (ii) fees and formalities connected with importation and exportation); (iii) publication and administration of trade regulations. Moreover, the mandate referred to provisions for effective cooperation between customs or any other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues. The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which concluded negotiations on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text. At its meeting on 26 November 2014, the WTO's General Council adopted the Protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and opened it for acceptance by the WTO Members. The Protocol should now be concluded on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to conclude the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. The protocol includes the Agreement on Trade facilitation and the commitments will become an integral part of the Agreement. The Agreement contains a set of measures designed to improve the cross-border movement of goods by improving transparency, streamlining customs procedures and eliminating red tape. For developing countries, it also contains innovative flexibilities which may become standard in future rules type agreements. The Agreement is divided into two sections: The OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators estimate that comprehensive implementation of all measures of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation would reduce total trade costs by 10% in developed countries and by 13-15.5% in developing countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: The Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. The Budapest Convention on the contract for the carriage of goods by inland waterways (CMNI) is a valuable instrument for promoting inland navigation across Europe. The Convention has been adopted by the Diplomatic Conference organised jointly by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine and the Danube Commission in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The Budapest Convention is not open to participation by regional economic integration organisations. As a result, the Union is not in a position to become a Contracting Party to the Budapest Convention. Eleven of the Member States of the Union, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia are Contracting Parties to the Budapest Convention. Belgium ratified the Convention on 5 August 2008. Austria and Poland, which have navigable inland waterways coming within the scope of the Convention, expressed their interest in becoming Contracting Parties. The remaining Member States of the Union indicated that they do not have inland waterways covered by the Budapest Convention and thus they do not have an interest in ratifying or acceding to the Convention. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council authorise Austria and Poland to ratify or to accede to, the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI). The Convention, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, has proven to be a great success and contributes to the internal market in the field of transport. It aims to harmonise contractual and inland navigational standards among European countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 48 of Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as amended by a Regulation (EU, Euratom) of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice, provides that the General Court, consisting of 40 Judges as from the date of entry into force of the amending Regulation, will consist of 47 Judges as from 1 September 2016, and of two Judges per Member State as from 1 September 2019. Increasing by seven the number of Judges of the General Court on 1 September 2016 will also require jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between the Union and its servants to be transferred to the General Court, which presupposes, the dissolution of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal (CST). CONTENT: the draft Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council set out below is based on Article 256(1) TFEU, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 TFEU, the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU, and Article 106a(1) EAEC. The proposed text: 1) repeals Council Decision 2004/752/EC, Euratom establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal and, in consequence thereof, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 979/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to temporary Judges of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal; 2) introduces two new Articles into the Statute of the Court seeking to: set out that the General Court shall exercise at first instance jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and its servants, including disputes between all institutions and all bodies, offices or agencies, on the one hand, and their servants, on the other, in respect of which jurisdiction is conferred on the Court of Justice of the European Union; enable the court responsible for civil service disputes to examine, at all stages of the procedure, the possibilities of amicable settlement of disputes. A new Article provides, in general terms, that the provisions relating to the jurisdiction, composition, organisation and procedure of any specialised court established under Article 257 TFEU are to be contained in an Annex to the Statute. 3) governs the procedure for dealing with cases pending before the Civil Service Tribunal (‚ÄòCST‚Äô) on 31 August 2016 , which are to be transferred, on 1 September 2016, to the General Court. The General Court should continue dealing with those cases as it finds them at that date, the procedural steps taken by the CST in those cases remaining applicable. In the event of a case being transferred to the General Court after the hearing, the oral part of the procedure would be reopened; 4) lays down a transitional regime in respect of appeals under examination when jurisdiction is transferred on 1 September 2016, or brought after that date, against decisions of the CST. The General Court is to continue to have jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeals. Accordingly, Articles 9 to 12 of Annex I to the Statute of the Court must remain applicable to the proceedings concerned. If the General Court sets aside a decision of the CST but considers that the state of the proceedings does not permit a decision, it is to refer the case to a chamber other than that which ruled on the appeal (that is to say, the Appeal Chamber). Lastly, the proposal sets the date on which the transfer of jurisdiction to the General Court to rule at first instance on disputes between the Union and its servants is to take effect as 1 September 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation. Article 25 of this regulation determines that the total amount of the reserve for crises in agricultural sector shall be EUR 2 800 million with equal annual instalments of EUR 400 million (at 2011 prices) for the period 2014-2020 and shall be included under Heading 2 of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is only to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore, it provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022. The Commission has to present a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no later than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment rate applies. CONTENT: this proposal aims to implement the provisions of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. It seeks to set the percentage rate of the financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015. The proposed Regulation lays down the amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 1999/32/EC has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment. This Directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union. With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the proposal provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where the environmental conditions allow; (ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. To recall, in 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL), containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 953/2003 to avoid trade diversion into the European Union of certain key medicines. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, those heavily reduced prices cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets. The proposed codified Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Union. Exemptions are laid down for certain situations under the strict provision that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question is one of the countries listed in Annex II. More specifically, the proposed Regulation lays down: the criteria for establishing what is a tiered priced product; the conditions under which the customs authorities shall take action; the measures which shall be taken by the competent authorities in the Member States."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals setting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and accused persons. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings; (ii) a directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant proceedings. This measure also forms part of the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child to which the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and UNICEF have contributed. It is presented together with a Commission Recommendation on procedural safeguards for vulnerable persons suspected or accused in criminal proceedings and vulnerable persons subject to European arrest warrant proceedings. By establishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the trust of Member States in the criminal justice systems of other Member States and can thus help improve mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment to support this proposal. CONTENT : the draft directive aims to: ¬∑  establish procedural safeguards to ensure that children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings are able to understand and follow those proceedings; ¬∑  enable such children to exercise their right to a fair trial and to prevent re-offending by children and foster their social integration. The directive will apply to children, meaning persons under the age of 18, subject to criminal proceedings from the time when they become suspected or accused of having committed an offence and until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. Children will have the following procedural guarantees : Right to information : the child should be informed promptly of the rights under the Directive. In proceedings involving children, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a rapid response and protect the best interests of the child. Right to information of the holder of parental responsibility : further complementary safeguards are provided with regard to the information of the holder of parental responsibility or an appropriate adult in order the take into account the specific needs of children provided that this does not prejudice the due course of the criminal proceedings. Right to an individual assessment : such an individual assessment is needed in order to identify the child's specific needs in terms of protection, education, training and re-integration into society, to determine to what extent he or she would need special measures during criminal proceedings. The individual assessment should be carried out at the latest before the indictment. Right to a lawyer : the directive aims to ensure mandatory access to a lawyer for children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. It also provides that children may not waive this right. However, there are exceptions that include certain minor offences in relation to general municipal regulations and minor public order offences. Right to medical examination : if the child is deprived of liberty, the child should have the right to medical examination upon request by the holder of parental responsibility, the appropriate adult or the child's lawyer. If the medical examination of a child leads to the conclusion that the measures envisaged during the criminal proceedings against the child (e.g. questioning of the child, detention) are incompatible with the general mental and physical condition of the child, the competent authorities should take appropriate measures in accordance with national law. Questioning of children: if a child is deprived of liberty, questioning should always be recorded. Such records must be accessible only to the judicial authorities and the parties of the proceedings to ensure their content and context. Right to liberty : in accordance with United Nation‚Äôs rules on the rights of the child, any form of deprivation of liberty of children should be a measure of last resort and be for the shortest appropriate period of time. Taking into account these international standards, this Directive sets minimum rules as regards detention. In order to avoid deprivation of liberty for children, competent authorities should take any alternative measures to deprivation of liberty whenever this is in the best interests of the child. Right to specific treatment in case of deprivation of liberty: children in particular should have the right to: (i) maintain regular and meaningful contact with parents, family and friends; (ii) receive appropriate education, guidance and training; (iii) receive medical care; (iv) be kept separately from adults in order to take into account their vulnerability. Right to protection of privacy: children should be judged in the absence of public. In exceptional cases the court may decide that a hearing is held publicly after it has taken due account of the best interests of the child. In order to ensure proper assistance and support of the child during court hearings, the holder of parental responsibility should be present. Right of children to appear in person at the trial: the right to be present at trial applies to any trial aiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and acquittal decisions). European arrest warrant proceedings : the proposal applies to children subject to proceedings pursuant to Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA from the time they are arrested in the executing State. The competent authorities in executing Member States shall apply the rights set out in the directive, which will promote mutual trust and mutual recognition."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2013/36/EU and 2009/110/EC and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress and integration of retail payments in the EU have been achieved over the past 12 years, with the current regulatory and legislative acquis on payments. Moreover, the retail payments market is very dynamic and has experienced a significant innovation pace in the last few years. At the same time, important areas of the payments market, especially card payments and new means of payments, such as internet and mobile payments, are often still fragmented along national borders making it difficult for innovative and easy-to-use digital payment services to develop efficiently and to provide consumers and retailers with convenient and secure payment methods. The review of the European framework and notably Directive 2007/64/EC on the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the consultation on the Commission Green Paper ‚ÄòTowards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments‚Äô in 2012 have led to the conclusion that further measures and regulatory updates, including adjustments to the PSD, are required. In the Commission‚Äôs 2012 Communication ‚ÄúSingle Market Act II ‚Äì Together for new growth‚Äù, the modernisation of the legislative framework for retail payments has been identified as a key priority in view of its potential for new growth and innovation. The revision of the PSD and the preparation of a legislative proposal on multilateral interchange fees for card payments were defined as one of the key actions of the Commission for 2013. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that the best policy options to improve the existing situation by (i) reinforcing the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project; (ii) facilitating standardisation through adequate governance framework; (iii) ensuring legal certainty in the field of interchange fees for card-based payments; (iv) abolishing restrictive business rules for card payments; (v) defining conditions of access to the information on the availability of funds for third party providers; (vi) adjusting the scope and improve the consistency of the legislative framework; (vii) reinforcing the rights of payment services users and safeguard the consumer rights in view of the regulatory changes. CONTENT: this proposal also incorporates and repeals Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Payment Services Directive which sets the basis for a harmonised legal framework for the creation of an integrated payments market. It aims to update and complement the current framework on payments services by providing for rules that enhance transparency, innovation and security in the field of retail payments and improving consistency between national rules, with an emphasis on the legitimate needs of consumers. More specifically, the proposed measures seek to: ensure a competitive level playing field between all categories of payment service providers, including new emerging providers, which in turn increases the choice, efficiency, transparency and security of retail payments; facilitate the provision of innovative card, internet and mobile payment services across borders by ensuring a Single Market for all retail payments; address standardisation and interoperability gaps for card, internet and mobile payments; eliminate hurdles for competition , in particular for card and internet payments; align charging and steering practices for payment services across the EU; ensure that emerging types of payment services and instruments are covered by the regulatory framework for retail payments in the EU; ensure a consistent application of the legislative framework (PSD) and align the practical operation of the licensing and supervisory rules for payment services across Member States; ensure adequate and consistent protection of consumer interests in the context of payment transactions, including extending regulatory protection to new channels and innovative payment services. The proposed measures seek to implement this reform in a technologically neutral manner that will remain relevant as payment services evolve further. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the impact on the EU budget is estimated at EUR 609 000 for the period 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains measures empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No 29) of the ILO is one of the ILO‚Äôs eight fundamental Conventions that make up the core international labour standards, and it is considered a human rights instrument. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO estimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced labour. In 2014, the International Labour Conference adopted the Protocol on the forced labour convention seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress on preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and compensating victims of forced labour. The European Union (EU) is committed to promoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human beings, both internally and in its external relations. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related Protocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the EU‚Äôs policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and improving working conditions worldwide. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to authorise the Member States to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation. The Protocol is a binding international agreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates legal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by States that have ratified the Convention. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), and more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention, Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol outside the framework of the EU‚Äôs institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall into areas of EU competence. However, the EU as such cannot ratify an ILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such Protocols. The Protocol‚Äôs provisions strengthen the international legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced labour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as compensation. The Protocol sets out the measures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely: The Protocol addresses areas of EU law that are already subject to an advanced degree of regulation: (i) certain aspects covered by EU social policy, in respect of which EU law sets minimum rules on working conditions; (ii) certain aspects relating to the freedom of movement for workers. The Commission proposes that the Decision should be based on the one hand on Article 153(2) TFEU, second subparagraph TFEU, in conjunction with Article 218(6) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on protecting and improving working conditions, relevant to preventing forced labour. The provisions of the draft Protocol other than the provisions related to social policy will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision. The Decision recommends that Member States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. . ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fight against breach of customs legislation entails extensive exchange of information in the framework of cooperation both between Member States and between the latter and the Commission. While such cooperation has already been successful, a number of areas have been identified where further action is necessary, mainly as regards the functioning of the antifraud system in the customs field and the improvement of customs risk management at national and Union levels. There are several challenges. ¬∑  Address loopholes in the existing systems for the detection of customs-related fraud : the Commission considers that the effectiveness of current measures might be improved if the relevant services are supported by systematic availability of high-quality and timely data on container movements (Container Status Messages - CSMs) carrying goods, imports, exports and transit at national and EU levels. ¬∑  Enhance customs risk management and supply chain security at national and EU levels: there is a need to: (i) establish an equivalent level of customs controls for goods brought into/ taken out of the customs territory of the Union; (ii) introduce a Union-wide risk management framework to support a common approach. ¬∑  Address delays in OLAF investigations : the documents supporting import and export declarations (invoice, certificate of origin, etc.) are no longer kept by customs administrations but by economic operators. Member States must first obtain this information from economic operators before transmitting the information to the Commission. Such a system is inefficient because it delays OLAF‚Äôs investigations. ¬∑  Clarify the possibility of restricting visibility of data : the AFIS IT system is currently underused because Member States are not able to select the potential users of the information they insert in the system. Users would more readily share information that they possess within the AFIS system if they were able to shield sensitive data. ¬∑  Streamline data protection supervision : it is necessary to have closer collaboration between the two supervisory bodies: the European Data Protection Supervisor ‚Äì EDPS and Customs Joint Supervisory Authority ‚Äì CJSA. Another issue in the area of data protection which needs to be further clarified is the responsibility for the technical systems established by the Commission. ¬∑  Clarify the admissibility of evidence collected under mutual assistance : it appears necessary to clarify that the evidence obtained through mutual assistance may be used by prosecutors in the national criminal proceedings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of policy options concluded that the main amendments would comprise the following objectives: (i) create conditions for improved fighting of customs fraud related to misdeclaration of goods origin, misdescription of goods and misuse of the transit system; (ii) speed up OLAF investigations. The proposed options are in line with the fundamental rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) n¬∞ 515/97 so as to improve the detection, investigation and prevention of customs-related fraud, by increasing the exchange of information and the available evidence, and improving the functioning of the established system. Specifically, the proposal aims to: ¬∑  update the concept of customs legislation, in order to have the terminology aligned with the customs field, adding references to entry and exit of goods; ¬∑  remove the legal uncertainty that currently exists in relation to the possible use of information collected through mutual assistance as evidence in national criminal proceedings; ¬∑  oblige carriers to supply the Commission with the information on container movements (i.e. Container Status Messages ‚Äî CSMs); ¬∑  create a central database for import and export data; ¬∑  create a centralised repository for transit-related data; ¬∑  enable the Commission to obtain directly from private sector operators documents supporting import and export declarations, in order to speed up OLAF‚Äôs investigations; ¬∑  introduce the possibility of selecting the potential users of data (restricted visibility) so that Member States might increase the use of databases and consequently contribute to efficiency; ¬∑  simplify and harmonise the rules for the supervision of data protection rules applicable to the EDPS and the CJSA. The proposal also introduces a maximum retention period of ten years for data stored in the CIS, stipulating that in cases where personal data are stored for a period exceeding five years, the EDPS should be informed accordingly. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary cost is estimated at EUR 60.526 million (including human resources and other administrative expenditure) for the period 2014-2020. The budgetary effort concerns mainly the IT costs to maintain and further develop the existing AFIS system. The costs related to the implementation of the proposal will be handled within the framework of the existing forecast in the context of Multiannual Financial Framework and therefore no additional request for budgetary allocation is required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 introduced a general ban on placing seal products on the Union's market (Basic Regulation). Those measures were adopted in response to public moral concerns about the animal welfare aspects of the killing of seals. At the same time, seal hunting is an integral part of the culture and identity of the Inuit and other indigenous communities and makes a major contribution to their subsistence. It is for this reason that the Basic Regulation contains: an exception from the general ban for seal products derived from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities that contribute to their subsistence (""the IC exception""); exceptions for the import of seal products derived from seals hunted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine resources on a not-for profit basis and not for commercial reasons (""the MRM exception"") as well as for imports of an occasional nature and which consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. An implementing Regulation, Commission Regulation (EU) No 737/2010 lays down detailed rules for the implementation of the Basic Regulation. Both acts were challenged by Canada and Norway in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In June 2014, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the reports disapproving the IC and MRM exceptions. ¬∑ The MRM exception was found not to be justified as the possible difference in the commercial dimension of commercial hunts and MRM hunts (small scale, non-profit) was not sufficient to justify the distinction. ¬∑ With regard to the IC exception, while in principle reflecting a legitimate distinction, the Appellate body ruled, that some elements of its design and application amounted to ‚Äúarbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination‚Äù. The purpose of this proposal is to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings with regard to the Basic Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products states that the placing on the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities, provided that the following conditions are all satisfied: the hunt has been traditionally conducted by the community; the hunt contributes to the subsistence of the community and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons; the hunt is conducted in a manner which reduces pain, distress, fear or other forms of suffering of the animals hunted to the extent possible taking into consideration the traditional way of life and the subsistence needs of the community. As regards the import of seal products , this shall also be allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. The nature and quantity of such goods shall not be such as to indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU labour law directives are generally applicable to all sectors of activity and all categories of workers. Nevertheless, seafarers are excluded or can be excluded from the scope of six directives, without any express justification. The directives concerned are the following: Directive 2008/94/EC relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer (hereafter referred to as ‚Äòthe Employer Insolvency Directive‚Äô); Directive 2009/38/EC on the establishment of European Works Council (hereafter referred to as the ‚ÄòEuropean Works Council Directive‚Äô); Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees (hereafter referred to as the ‚ÄòInformation and Consultation Directive‚Äô); Directive 98/59/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (hereafter referred to as the ‚ÄòCollective Redundancies Directive‚Äô); Directive 2001/23/EC relating to the safeguarding of employees‚Äô rights in the event of transfers of undertakings (hereafter referred to as the ‚ÄòTransfer of Undertakings Directive‚Äô); Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (hereafter referred to as the ‚ÄòPosting of Workers Directive‚Äô). Depending on the situation at national level, exclusions could have a negative impact on a number of rights recognised under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to information and consultation within the undertaking and the right to fair and just working conditions. Most of the Member States have made little or no use of the exclusions which gives rise to a potential situation whereby the same categories of workers are treated differently in the different Member States. The number of EU national seafarers is steadily decreasing and this could be problematic for the future, notably because experience off-shore is essential for certain shore-based jobs. Although this could be the consequence of different factors, the lack of interest in maritime careers may be reinforced by the impression that seafarers are less well protected than other employees. As a consequence, the aim of the proposal is to improve the level of protection of the rights protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in EU labour law and to ensure a level playing field at EU level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the Directive to be amended, different options have been identified: suppression of the exclusions for the Insolvency Directive and for the European Works Council Directive; granting a derogation concerning the equivalent level of protection for the Information and Consultation Directive; including specific provisions for the Collective Redundancies Directive and for the Transfer of Undertakings Directive; As regards the Posting of Workers Directive, it was decided that no changes should be made. LEGAL BASIS: This proposal introduces amendments to five existing Directives: Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC. Three of these Directives were adopted with Article 153 TFEU (former Article 137 EC) as legal basis: 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC and 2008/94/EC. The legal bases of Directives 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC were respectively Articles 100 EC and 94 EC, i.e., equivalent to the current Article 115 TFEU. Despite the different legal bases of the Directives to be amended, having regard to their content, it is clear that they all serve to support and complement Member States' activities in the fields enumerated in Article 153(1) TFEU, in order to further the social policy objectives of the Union. Article 153(2) TFEU is therefore the adequate legal basis for a single proposal amending the abovementioned five Directives. CONTENT: this proposal introduces amendments to five Directives in force. The amending provisions may be summarised as follows : Right to information and consultation : the proposal recognises an unconditional right to information and consultation of seagoing workers in all Directives which previously allowed for exceptions and derogations from this right (European Works Councils Directive, Information and Consultation Directive, Collective Redundancies Directive, Transfer of Undertakings Directive). Principles : the proposal also recognises other rights, taking into account the specificity of the sector (suppression in some specific cases of cooling-off periods in the Collective Redundancies Directive or of the transfer of the employment contract/relationship in the Transfer of Undertakings Directive). Amendments to the Directives : a) reintroduction of seafarers into the scope of certain Directives : the deletion of Article 1(3), point (b) of Directive 2008/94/EC. This will suppress the possibility of excluding share-fishermen from the scope of the Insolvency Directive; suppression of Article 1(7) of Directive 2009/38/EC. Merchant navy crews will therefore be covered by the provisions of the European Works Council Directive. b) new rights : modifications to Article 3(3) of Directive 2002/14/EC in order to clarify that Member States are able to derogate from the general provisions of the Directive only where an equivalent level of protection and effective exercise by the employees concerned is ensured. c) collective redundancies : Directive 98/59/EC is amended as follows: insertion of the definition of ‚Äòtransfer‚Äô, by reference to Directive 2001/23/EC; deletion of Article 1(2)(c), thus putting the crews of seagoing vessels within the scope of the Collective Redundancies Directive; clarification that the notification provided for by Article 3(1) of the Directive should always be made to the competent authority of the State of the flag. This clarification is necessary because of the potential coexistence of employment contracts under different national laws; insertion of a new provision stating that Member States may grant the competent public authority the right to derogate, in part of in full, from the provisions on the ‚Äòcooling-off‚Äô period when the envisaged collective redundancy is carried out as a consequence of a transfer, having as its object exclusively one vessel or more vessels, or when the employer only operates one vessel. If Member States would like to make use of this derogation, they have to consult social partners when transposing this provision into their legislation. This amendment takes into account the characteristics of the maritime sector. It should be underlined that in the case of a sale consisting exclusively of one vessel or more, or in the case of an employer operating one vessel, the information and consultation obligation laid down in Article 2 continues to apply. The Directive remains fully applicable in all other circumstances where the collective dismissal of members of the crew of a vessel is envisaged. d) transfer of undertakings : current Article 1(3) of Directive 2001/23/EC is repealed. The Directive is made fully applicable to seagoing vessels registered in and/or flying the flag of a Member State, wherever they are situated. However, taking into account the specific characteristics of the maritime sector, Member States may, after consultation of social partners, derogate from the provisions of Chapter II of the Directive in the case of transfers concerning exclusively one seagoing vessel or a number of seagoing vessels, or the undertaking or business being transferred only operates one seagoing vessel. Consequently, in case of transfers concerning vessels exclusively or in the case of the undertaking only operating one vessel, at least the provisions of the Directive concerning information and consultation shall apply. Vessels are fully covered by the scope of the Directive when they constitute one of the assets being transferred. Non-regression clause : this clause aims at safeguarding the rights of workers covered by the scope of the proposal as recognised by the Member States before its entry into force. Review clause : the objective of the review is to monitor the implementation and application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Directive in the Member States, in particular on two issues: the phenomenon of flagging out, the level of employment of EU seafarers. Transition period : in order to take into account the differences between Member States regarding the nature of the maritime sector and the extent to which seafarers are included in the scope of national labour legislation, the proposal provides for a transition period of 5 years."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations with Palau were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters. During further exchanges agreement was reached on all aspects. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 27 May 2015 (Palau) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Palau on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Palau when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Palau may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Palau to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Palau remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Palau to stay only in those Member States‚Äô European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Colombia. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Colombian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Colombians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru. On 19 May 2015, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations with Colombia were opened on 20 May 2015 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Colombia on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Colombia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Colombia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Colombia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Colombia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Colombia to stay only in those Member States‚Äô European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the ""Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products"", known as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), was concluded by 29 WTO Member States at the Singapore Ministerial Conference in 1996. The ITA entered into force in the European Union in 1997. Today, the ITA counts 82 participants, or half of WTO Members, and covers 97 % of trade in this sector. The ITA requires that each participant eliminates and binds customs duties at zero on a Most Favoured Nation basis for all information technology (IT) products covered. The ITA covers about 200 tariff lines, including computers, telephones, but also inputs, components and machinery for the production of IT goods. The ITA Ministerial Declaration establishes that participants shall meet periodically under the auspices of the Council on Trade in Goods to review the product coverage specified in the Attachments, with a view to agreeing, by consensus, whether in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the HS nomenclature, the Attachments should be modified to incorporate additional products. In May 2012, several countries proposed to expand the product coverage of the ITA. On 24 July 2015, the text of the ""Declaration on the Expansion of Trade on Information Technology Products"" was agreed, with a view to bind and eliminate customs duties on an additional list of 201 IT products. Annual trade in these 201 products is valued at over USD 1.3 trillion per year, and accounts for approximately 10 % of total global trade today. The participants agreed on the staging commitments for each product listed in document G/MA/W/117. The agreement in the form of a Declaration on the Expansion of the ITA (and the schedules containing the staging commitments of the participants) was adopted by the Ministers of the participant countries on 16 December 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an economic assessment was made by an external company before the negotiations started. With the final results of the negotiations now known, the Commission has made its own in-house assessment, of which the following three elements are the most important findings: CONTENT: under this draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA), together with the schedules submitted by other participants in the negotiations and which are contained in the WTO document G/MA/W/117. The objective of the ITA expansion is to eliminate duties on IT goods not included in the original ITA. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in total the European Union is expected to lose EUR 1.5 billion in duties on IT goods. However, this loss will be spread out over a total of 7 years. Most low duties will be eliminated at entry into force, representing 25 % of duty value. After 3 years more than 60 % of duty will have been phased out, while 30 % will only be eliminated after 7 years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate individual Framework Agreements on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with the Philippines started in February 2009 and were concluded in June 2010. Both sides initialled the PCA on 25 June 2010. The PCA was signed in Phnom Penh on 11 July 2012, on the occasion of the ASEAN Regional Forum ministerial meeting. The PCA with the Philippines is the first-ever bilateral agreement with the Philippines and supersedes the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is now necessary to approve the Framework-Agreement on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: the Commission notes that Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA with the Philippines is the subject of Court Case C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul the above-mentioned Decision insofar as the Council had added the legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100 TFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4) TFEU). The Commission asked the Court to maintain the effects of the contested decision. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA is based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6). The Framework Agreement draws the attention of the Council to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The addition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on the outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice, this recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The Commission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure for conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised. CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Philippines, of the other part. General principles and political dialogue: the PCA with the Philippines marks an important step towards strengthening bilateral relations and the EU‚Äôs role in South-East Asia, based on shared universal values such as democracy and human rights. It paves the way for enhanced political, regional and global cooperation. Foreign policy: the PCA contains commitments which are central to the EU‚Äôs foreign policy, including provisions on: It also includes areas of current interest such as the peace process and disaster risk management. Economic and trade cooperation: the PCA considerably broadens the scope for mutual engagement in the economic and trade domain. It has an important trade cooperation section, which should facilitate free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries. Additionally, the PCA has an important development component, including strict provisions on protecting the EU‚Äôs financial interests. Sectoral cooperation: the PCA strengthens the sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as: Institutional Framework: the draft Agreement also includes institutional provisions to put in place a joint committee composed of representatives of the two Parties with the aim of ensuring the correct application of the Agreement and resolving conflicts."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU on 17 July 1995, which came into force on 1 March 1998. Tunisia is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. In parallel to this political transition process, the Tunisian economy has suffered from continuous domestic unrest, regional instability (including the impact of the Libyan conflicts) and a weak international environment (particularly in the Union, Tunisia‚Äôs main trading partner). These unfavourable developments substantially weakened its growth performance, as well as its fiscal and balance of payments positions. Since 2011, the Union has expressed its unequivocal commitment to supporting Tunisia in its economic and political reform process. It has increased its financial support to Tunisia, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including the civil society the electoral system, security, regional development and social and economic reforms. And it has offered the possibility of concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement, the negotiations of which were launched in October 2014. Tunisia reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion, which was approved by the IMF Board on June 2013, and which was subsequently extended until December 2015. It also requested in August 2013 complementary Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU. In response, the European Commission proposed a MFA of EUR 250 million in December 2013 in the form of loans (MFA-I), which the co-legislators raised to EUR 300 million and approved in May 2014 (Decision No 534/2014/EU). This amount is being successfully implemented. Following the completion of the 6th review of the IMF programme last September, Tunisia requested a successor arrangement with the IMF, probably of a 4-year duration. The new IMF programme is still under negotiation but expected to be sent for IMF Board approval in the spring of 2016. In 2015, the Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by several terrorist attacks that have targeted key economic industries like tourism and transport as well as aiming to disrupt the consolidation of its political transition. In this context, Tunisia requested a second MFA operation from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million, which would accompany the successor IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Tunisia for a total maximum amount of EUR 500 million, provided in the form of a medium term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2016-17, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance, to be disbursed in three instalments (EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million and EUR 150 million, respectively), should help the country overcome its difficult economic and balance of payments situation it is experiencing, which has been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks it suffered in 2015 and by persistent domestic and regional unrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable economic growth and improving public finance management. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). In addition, the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (""the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2016 for a total amount of EUR 350 million and the third loan disbursement in 2017 for the amount of EUR 150 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-2019 budgets. The implications on expenditure (including human resources and administrative costs) are estimated at EUR 45.295 million for 2016-2019."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current EU animal health legislative framework involves almost 50 basic Directives and Regulations and some 400 pieces of secondary legislation, some of them adopted as early as 1964. The main elements of the existing policy were drawn up largely between 1988 and 1995 when there were only twelve Member States. New challenges, such as new diseases, have since emerged, and certain existing ones have reappeared. Trading conditions have also changed, with volumes of trade in animals and animal products increasing greatly, both within the EU and with third countries. There have, furthermore, been important scientific and technological developments, as well as important institutional changes within the EU. A number of problems have been identified in regard to the existing legislation: with respect to the general policy approach: - the high complexity of the current Community Animal Health Policy (CAHP); - the lack of an overall strategy - an insufficient focus on disease prevention, with a particular focus on the need for increased biosecurity. with respect to the functioning of existing legislation: - issues related to intra-Union trade in live animals. For the above reasons, the European Commission is proposing a single, comprehensive animal health law to replace the complex animal health rules currently in place. This proposal is part of a comprehensive package that also includes three other proposals to modernise the plant health, plant reproductive material and official controls acquis. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. An evaluation of the CAHP in the last decade led to the adoption of the new EU Animal Health Strategy 2007-2013 (AHS) ""Prevention is better than cure"". The AHS, which was welcomed by Parliament, provides for the adoption of a ""single regulatory framework for animal health with a greater focus on incentives than penalties, consistent with other EU policies and converging to international standards"" and which will ""define and integrate common principles and requirements of existing legislation"". LEGAL BASIS: Articles 43, 114 and 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal seeks to establish a single, simplified, transparent and clear regulatory framework that sets out systematically the objectives, scope and principles of regulatory intervention in the field of animal health. Aim of the proposal: the proposal aims to improve standards and to provide a common system to better detect and control disease and tackle health, food and feed safety risks in a coordinated way. It seeks to focus on long-term preventative measures and working together with relevant stakeholders. Responsibilities of actors : the responsibilities of all the different actors having a key role in the safeguarding of animal health, such as operators, veterinarians, and pet keepers, are explicitly laid down for the first time in EU law. In particular, operators and animal professionals are now required to acquire a basic knowledge of animal health and related matters. Notification and surveillance: the proposal clarifies the responsibilities for notification and surveillance, including animal health visits. It clarifies the roles of operators, competent authorities and others as regards surveillance of the animal health situation in the Union. Better use will be made of the synergies between surveillance undertaken by the different actors in the field to ensure the most effective and cost-efficient use of surveillance resources. Compartments, permitted only for Avian Influenza-related measures and in aquaculture at present, can now be used more widely. This allows more flexibility in disease control measures, introducing the possibility of continuing movements and trade under certain circumstances, considered from a risk-based perspective. Disease Preparedness, Awareness and Control: the proposal continues to require Member States to draw up contingency plans for dealing with certain diseases, and to practise their implementation. It provides: (i) explicity for a regulatory framework for vaccination; (ii) rules for the use of antigen, vaccine and reagent banks; and (iii) rules on control measures to be taken in the case of suspicion of or confirmed disease outbreaks of certain diseases. Requirements concerning Registration, Approval, Traceability and Movements : there would be distinct rules for terrestrial, aquatic, and other animals because of their different production methods and epidemiology. The proposal introduces the possibility for more animals to be registered and traced through electronic means, promoting simplicity and better regulation. Imports and exports: the proposal sets out the standards and requirements for third countries in regard to animal imports, as well as requirements for exports. No practical changes from the existing legislation are envisaged. Emergency Measures: these are considered a vital component of disease management and comprise the procedures to be followed in case of emergency, ensuring a rapid and consistent Union response. Only a few practical changes from the existing legislation are envisaged. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal does not imply expenditures which are not already included in the financial statement of the common financial framework for food chain, animal health and welfare, and relating to plant health and plant reproductive material. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal includes provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the School Milk Scheme and the School Fruit Scheme have developed independently and in different time periods: the School Milk Scheme has been implemented since 1977, and the School Fruit Scheme came out of a political commitment in the context of the 2007 reform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. The current schemes operate within different legal and financial frameworks, and have some important differences in their design and functioning. The Commission proposes changes to the programmes in order to make them more efficient, and better respond to the overarching problems of declining fruit and vegetable and milk consumption and rising obesity. Furthermore, the Commission made a commitment in the context of the adoption of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 to review the financing arrangements of the current schemes, namely aid for the distribution of milk as well as the co-financing of the school fruit scheme costs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three options considered, the option chosen is the ""new framework"" scenario that entails a considerable policy change in the form of a common legal and financing framework for the distribution of a restricted number of products, complemented by an orientation towards the long-term objectives through a strengthened educational dimension of the scheme. CONTENT: it is proposed to establish a common legal and financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk to children in schools, supported by strengthened educational measures to reaffirm the link with agriculture, as well as wider issues such as public health and environmental matters. The proposal sets out the key elements of the new scheme. 1) Distribution : it is proposed to focus the distribution of products in schools to two ""core products"": fresh fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and drinking milk only, with the fat content of drinking milk to be decided upon by national health authorities. The distribution will take place within a fixed budget, and will help reverse the declining consumption trends for these two groups of products. 2) Unify the financial provisions and improve financing conditions : in view of the differences between the products and their supply chains, as well as different consumption situation across the Member States, separate ""envelopes"" would be allocated to Member States for fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and milk. The envelope for fruit and vegetables is EUR 150 million and the envelope for milk is EUR 80 million. Certain flexibility is provided for, where Member States can transfer limited shares of their allocations between the envelopes based on their needs. Accordingly, without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 230 million Member States may transfer up to 15% of their indicative allocations for fruit and vegetables including bananas or for milk to the other sector under conditions to be specified by the Commission by means of delegated acts Within the envelopes, thresholds are established for supporting measures and other eligible measures, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication. Based on experience gained so far, the level of EU contribution towards the price of products is limited through a maximum EU aid per portion for fruit and vegetables and for milk, and not through the EU co-financing levels, as was the case for the School Fruit Scheme. This would be a new element for fruit and vegetables, which would help alleviate the huge disparities in price for products distributed and would imply a simplification in terms of a management. The level of EU subsidy for milk is increased. Member States will be allowed to continue providing national top-ups or attract private funding in order to enlarge the scope and/or the intensity of their intervention of the school schemes. The aid will be allocated to each Member State taking into account certain criteria including (i) the number of six- to ten-year old children as a proportion of the population, (ii) the degree of development of the regions within a Member State so to ensure higher aid to less developed regions and (iii) for milk, the historical use of funds. Reinforce the educational dimension : supporting educational measures will also become a requirement for milk distribution, thus bridging the gap between the current schemes. These measures will have a focus on agricultural issues, nutrition/health (balanced diets) and environmental matters and aim to connect children with food, agricultural production and farmers. Member States could choose thematic educational measures that could occasionally include agricultural products, other than the two core products, such as yoghurts, processed fruit and vegetables, honey, or olive oil. The list of all products supplied under the scheme and their nutritional aspects have to be approved by national health authorities. Supporting educational measures would have to be directly linked to the agricultural objectives of the scheme and be in line with the objective of promoting healthy diets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact of the proposal is budgetary neutral compared to the current situation. For fruit and vegetables , the budgetary ceiling currently set in Regulation No 1308/2013 (EUR 150 million per school year) is maintained in this proposal. For milk , the proposal includes an envelope of EUR 80 million per school year, corresponding to the expected budget execution and in line with the overall amounts for market-related expenditure and direct aids taken into account in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. As regards distribution of expenditure, the greatest support will be given to the distribution and supporting educational measures. Other costs, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication, will also be eligible to a more limited extent. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) are designed to measure inflation in a harmonised manner across Member States. The Commission and the European Central Bank use the HICP in their assessment of price stability in Member States under Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Harmonised consumer price indices are essential for assessing and measuring: (i) convergence in terms of price stability within the EU; and (ii) the results of euro area monetary policy, in terms of achieving the objective of price stability. In October 1995, a Council Regulation on harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) was drafted and adopted, followed by 20 implementing regulations in the following 17 years. Certain parameters have changed since the adoption of the original framework: (i) the development of the European Statistical System (ESS); (ii) the technical aspects of data collection and index compilation have changed dramatically due to the rapid rate of technological progress in recent years; (iii) the Lisbon Treaty established a new comitology set-up. These various changes all necessitate redrafting of the legislation on HICP so as to modernise and rationalise the legal basis and adapt it to today‚Äôs needs, both actual and potential. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish a common legal framework for the production of harmonised indices by Member States, which involves collecting, compiling, processing and submitting harmonised consumer price indices. The proposal for a revised HICP Regulation seeks to create a single legal measure covering all uniform conditions. It would combine the different implementing regulations into a single one, which would give stakeholders and Member States greater clarity and make administration easier and more effective. This proposal simplifies and clarifies the requirements for the compilation of these indices. It enshrines the principles of the European Statistics Code of Practice relating to commitment to quality, sound methodology, cost-effectiveness, relevance, accuracy, reliability, coherence and comparability. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes and agencies to ENP partner countries is one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union‚Äôs neighbourhood. The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication ‚Äúon the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes‚Äù. The Council endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007. The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. In December 2013, Tunisia expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Tunisia is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now appropriate for the European Union to conclude the protocol. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(7) thereof. CONTENT: this is a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol. This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes. It contains standard conditions that should be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with whom such protocols are to be concluded. Objectives: the protocol seeks to define the financial and technical rules permitting Tunisia to participate in certain EU programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical cooperation measure and allows Tunisia to receive technical assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the European Union pursuant to the European Union programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation 861/2007 established an alternative procedure in addition to the procedures existing under the laws of the Member States, for cross-border cases concerning claims which do not exceed EUR 2 000. The Regulation is applied in the EU (except in Denmark) as of 1 January 2009. Despite the benefits it could bring in terms of reducing the costs and time of litigating cross-border claims, the procedure is still little known and remains under-used several years after the entry into application of the Regulation. A Eurobarometer survey carried out in 2012, showed that 12% of the respondents were aware of the existence of the ESCP, with 1% of all respondents declaring that they already used the procedure. 69% of those who already used the procedure were satisfied. The survey also showed that the most important factors which would encourage citizens to go to court are: the possibility of carry out proceedings in writing without appearing in the court (33%), conducting proceedings without instructing a lawyer (26%), conducting proceedings on-line (20%) and using their own language (24%). The European Parliament affirmed in a 2011 resolution that more needs to be done in terms of legal certainty, language barriers and transparency of proceedings. It called on the Commission to take steps to ensure that consumers and businesses are made more aware and make use of existing legislative instruments, such as the European Small Claims Procedure. The Commission identified the revision of the Regulation in its 2013 EU Citizenship Report as one of the actions strengthening the rights of Union citizens, by facilitating the settlement of disputes regarding purchases made in another Member State. This initiative is included in the European Consumer Agenda. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: having carried out several consultations of interested parties, the Commission also undertook an impact assessment in support of its proposal. CONTENT : the Commission proposes to revise Regulation (EC) n¬∫ 861/2007 as follows: Extend the scope of the Regulation to cross-border claims up to EUR 10,000: raising the current threshold will allow parties to litigate a substantially bigger number of cases on the basis of the simplified European procedure. SMEs will be the main beneficiaries, but consumers will also benefit, since about one fifth of consumer claims exceed EUR 2,000. Extend the definition of cross border cases : the amendment means that the European Small Claim Procedure may be used in disputes involving parties domiciled in the same Member State which have a significant cross-border element and includes third-country residents. Improve the use of electronic means of communication , including for service of documents: the proposal will put postal service and electronic service on the same footing. For other, less important communications between the parties and the courts, the proposal will make electronic communication the rule, subject only to the agreement of the parties. Impose an obligation on courts to use videoconferencing, teleconferencing or other means of distance communication for the conduct of oral hearings and taking of evidence: oral hearings should be conducted through videoconferencing or other means of distance communication. In order to safeguard the rights of the parties, an exception will be made for the party who expressly requests to be present in court. Provide a maximum limitation on court fees charged for the procedure: the proposed amendment will not harmonise court fees in the Member States. Instead, it would set a maximum cap on court fees for applications under the Regulation, increasing the attractiveness of the procedure for claimants. The measure allows Member States to maintain a fixed minimum court fee. Provide for an obligation on the Member States to put in place on-line means of payment of court fees : when payment in cash or stamps is the only acceptable means of payment, parties may be discouraged from pursuing their claims. The proposal aims at obliging Member States to put in place distance means of payment, as a minimum bank transfers and credit/debit card on-line payment systems. Limit the requirement to translate the certificate of enforcement in Form D to only the substance of the judgment: the obligation to translate Form D imposes unnecessary costs. The amendment will limit the requirement of translation to the substance of the judgment in point 4.3 of Form D only. Impose information obligations on Member States in respect of court fees, methods of payment of court fees and the availability of assistance in filling in the forms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only implications for the budget of the European Union resulting from the proposed Regulation consist of the one-off costs for the preparation of a report 5 years after the date of application of the Regulation. The operational and administrative costs are estimated at EUR 437, 000 for the period 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 83/417/EEC provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption. Since the entry into force of that Directive several changes have taken place, notably the development of a comprehensive legal framework in the area of food law and the adoption of an international standard by the Codex Alimentarius for edible casein products, which need to be taken into account. Directive 83/417/EEC confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need to be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty) which allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. For the sake of clarity, Directive 83/417/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new Directive CONTENT: the proposal is aimed at designing the Commission's empowerment in the new legal context created by the Lisbon Treaty. It also takes account of the further development of legislation in the past years and of existing, updated international standards. The proposal: identifies the need for delegated power to be conferred on the Commission for the purpose of adopting amendments to Annexes I and II and establishes the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts in the new legal context determined by the entry into force of Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU; adapts existing provisions to the further development of legislation notably in the field of food law; adjust, where appropriate, the composition requirements of edible caseins to the corresponding Codex standard . This adjustment results in two changes: the maximum moisture content of edible casein is increased from 10 to 12% and the maximum milk fat content of edible acid casein is decreased from 2.25 to 2%. With this change, the compositional requirements laid down in the proposal are fully in line with the international standard so as to avoid trade distortions. Moreover the proposal takes into consideration the need for the Member States to have some margin to adapt the implementation to the national legal and administrative environment, in particular with reference to the possible adoption of national measures in matters not specifically harmonised by the proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European Union. In particular, it also contains rules on public procurement. Following the adoption of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC and of Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the award of concession contracts, provision should be made for the rules contained in these Directives to apply to contracts awarded by the European institutions on their own account. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union in order to take account of the new directives on public procurement and on the award of concession contracts awarded by the European institutions on their own account. The modifications brought about to the text of the Financial Regulation (FR) can be classified into three main groups. Alignment with the Directive : new provisions are introduced, such as market consultation, the new innovation partnership as a procedure, the introduction of compliance with environmental, social and labour law as a key requirement, evaluation of criteria in no particular order, award methodology based on the most economically advantageous tender. In addition, concessions for works and services are introduced for the first time in the FR and are subject to the same types of procedures as public contracts. Provisions on exclusion : the grounds for exclusion are clarified and aligned with the Directive as well as the possibility for the economic operator concerned to take remedial measures. Exclusion is clearly separated from the rejection from a given procedure to avoid confusion. A single system is set up for increasing the protection of the Union financial interests which takes into account the existing Central Exclusion Database. The aim of the system is to ensure the early detection and prevention of risk as well as the publication of information related to excluded economic operators. An exclusion panel is set up to take exclusion decisions after the analysis of the case and it guarantees the right of defence of economic operators. Clarifications of the text and simplifications : these concern publicity measures above and below thresholds, requirements for opening and evaluation, rejection of non-compliant tenders, bank guarantees for works and complex services contracts, the fact that Union institutions are considered central contracting authorities according to the Directive, the reference to applicable Directive thresholds, electronic procedures and the opening up of procurement by institutions to international organisations."

Council Regulation (EC) No 385/966 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities presupposes the existence of an international fisheries agreement when granting fishing authorisations to third-country vessels within EU waters. The EU has not concluded such an international fisheries agreement with Venezuela. However, access for Venezuelan fishing vessels operating in EU waters off the coast of the French department of Guiana has been provided in the form of a Council Declaration (Decision 2012/19/EU) which, in accordance with the case-law of the International Court of Justice, has legal effects under international law. By its judgement of 26 November 2014 on the joined cases C-103/12 and C-165/12 (European Parliament and the Commission v. Council), the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 2012/19/EU. It also confirmed that decisions relating to the conclusion of external fisheries agreements fall fully within the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU (in conjunction with the applicable procedure of Article 218 TFEU, i.e. Article 218(6)a(v) for the decisions on the conclusion) and rejected the position that such decisions could fall within the scope of Article 43(3) TFEU. The Court of Justice maintained the effects of the Council Decision until the entry into force, within a reasonable period of time after the date of the judgement, of a new decision to be adopted on an appropriate legal basis. Hence, the present proposal. CONTENT: in order to ensure the continuity of the access following the judgement of the Court, the Commission considers it necessary that the Council re-adopts a Decision on the declaration addressed to Venezuela confirming its readiness to issue fishing authorisations to a limited number of fishing vessels flying the flag of Venezuela on the condition that they comply with the applicable legally binding Union acts. The Declaration provides that in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters, the authorised fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall comply with the provisions of the European Union common fisheries policy concerning the conservation and control measures and other European Union provisions governing fishing activities in that zone. More particularly, authorised fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall comply with any relevant European Union rules or regulations specifying, inter alia, the fish stocks that may be targeted, the maximum number of authorised fishing vessels and the proportion of catches to be landed into ports in French Guiana."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation‚Äôs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was signed on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than ‚Ç¨10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation‚Äôs Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This Decision applies to the provisions of the Protocol which do not fall within the scope of Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Freedom, Security and Justice). The Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products. The Protocol provisions fall into different areas of EU activity which may be subdivided as follows: The Protocol: Those articles are complemented by provisions on: (i) record-keeping and security and preventive measures, including anti-money-laundering measures and reporting of suspicious transactions; (ii) sales by Internet; (iii) duty free sales of tobacco products and the obligation to implement effective controls on tobacco and tobacco products in the free zones, including not mixing tobacco products with non-tobacco products at the time of removal from a free zone. Part IV of the Protocol defines the conduct to be established as unlawful under the Parties‚Äô legislation and obliges the Parties to ensure that natural and legal persons are held liable for such unlawful conduct, including criminal offences. Further provisions concern seizure payments, the handling of confiscated tobacco and special investigative techniques. Part V of the Protocol contains provisions for the exchange of relevant information between the Parties, cooperation and mutual assistance (both administrative and legal in relation to criminal matters), jurisdiction and extradition. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission presented a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol, on behalf of the European Union, as regards provisions which fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. Currently citizens face different practical problems with asset planning when they are in an international marriage or partnership. The problem is that it is very difficult for people to know which courts have jurisdiction and which laws are applicable to their personal situation and the situation of their property. As a result, they face unintended, and disadvantageous, consequences not only in the daily management of their assets but also when the couple separates or a member of the couple dies. On 16 March 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial property regimes and a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions regarding the property consequences of registered partnerships. The European Parliament delivered its favourable opinion and comments on the two proposals on 10 September 2013. However, the Council concluded at its meeting of 3 December 2015 that it would not be possible to reach an EU-wide agreement in relation to both regulations within a reasonable period of time. To date, the Commission has received requests from 17 Member States indicating their wish to establish enhanced cooperation: Sweden, Belgium, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria and Finland. The Commission concluded that all the legal conditions set by the Treaties for the authorisation of the establishment of enhanced cooperation are fulfilled. It considered that the benefits of establishing enhanced cooperation are numerous compared to the option of keeping the status quo and that the advantages of establishing enhanced cooperation in this area outweigh any possible disadvantage. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision ‚Äì based on Article 329(1), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) ‚Äì seeks to authorise enhanced cooperation between 17 requesting Member States in the area of jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the property regimes of international couples, covering both matters of matrimonial property regimes and the property consequences of registered partnerships. Proposals for specific measures implementing the enhanced cooperation are submitted together with this proposal. According to the Commission, enhanced cooperation would bring citizens the following benefits: Enhanced cooperation shall be open at any time to all Member States, in accordance with Article 328 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The EU signed the FCTC Protocol on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than ‚Ç¨10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU (‚ÄòMiFID‚Äô) together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (‚ÄòMiFIR‚Äô) was adopted in the wake of the financial crisis. MiFID and MiFIR, collectively referred to as MiFID II, covers securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues. The new framework reinforces and replaces the current MiFID framework (Directive 2004/39/EC). Member States need to transpose the Directive by 3 July 2016. Both MiFID and MiFIR are scheduled to apply as of 3 January 2017. During the legislative process, the very high level of complexity of the MiFID II package and the need for a significant number of implementing measures were recognised. To this end, a period of 30 months was foreseen between the adoption and the entry into application, instead of the usual 18-24 months. Despite this unusually long period, ESMA has made clear to the Commission that the technical implementing challenges are of such magnitude that essential data infrastructures will not be in place in time for 3 January 2017. This is a result of significant challenges in collecting the data that is necessary for the operation of the MiFID II rules. The absence of data has ramifications across multiple areas of MIFID II. As regards market regulation, it is clear that without the foundation of reference data (instrument ID) and the additional data infrastructures for transparency calculations and position reporting in place, it will not be possible to apply the majority of the market rules. In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, urgent action is therefore needed to adjust the date of entry into application for MiFID II Changing the date of applicability of MiFID II does however have consequences for the applicability of other legislation, in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014 ('MAR' ‚Äì market abuse) and Regulation (EU) 909/2014 ('CSDR' - central securities depositories regulation). CONTENT: the purpose of the draft proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 on markets in financial instruments is to extend the entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in the MIFID II package as a result of the technical implementation challenges met by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), national competent authorities ('NCAs') and stakeholders. In order to enable ESMA, NCAs and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation, the Commission considered it appropriate to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 by 12 months until 3 January 2018. Reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly. The Commission stated that an extension of one year should provide sufficient and reasonable time for ESMA, NCAs and operators to put in place the infrastructure for data collection, reporting and the transparency threshold calculations. In order to ensure that references in Regulation (EU) 596/2014 to organised trading facilities, small and medium-sized enterprises‚Äô ('SME') growth markets, emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon do not apply until the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU, Article 39(4) of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 stating that references to them are read as references to Directive 2004/39/EC should be adjusted taking into account the extension of the date of application of those acts. In order to ensure that Directive 2004/39/EC is referenced in Regulation (EU) 909/2014 until the extended date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU and that the transitional provisions for MTFs applying for registration as SME growth markets under Regulation (EU) 909/2014 are maintained so as to provide sufficient time for MTFs to apply for such registration under Directive 2014/65/EU, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 909/2014 should be amended."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No 29) of the ILO is one of the ILO‚Äôs eight fundamental Conventions that make up the core international labour standards, and it is considered a human rights instrument.. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO estimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced labour. In 2014, the International Labour Conference adopted the Protocol on the forced labour convention seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress on preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and compensating victims of forced labour. The European Union (EU) is committed to promoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human beings, both internally and in its external relations. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related Protocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the EU‚Äôs policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and improving working conditions worldwide. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to authorise the Member States to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation. The Protocol is a binding international agreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates legal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by States that have ratified the Convention. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), and more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention, Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol outside the framework of the EU‚Äôs institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall into areas of EU competence. However, the EU as such cannot ratify an ILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such Protocols. The Protocol‚Äôs provisions strengthen the international legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced labour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as compensation. The Protocol sets out the measures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely: The Protocol addresses areas of EU law that are already subject to an advanced degree of regulation: (i) certain aspects relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in respect of which EU law sets minimum standards on anti-trafficking and victims‚Äô rights; (ii) certain aspects relating to rules on asylum and immigration. The Commission proposes that the Decision should be based on the one hand on Article 218(6) TFEU, in conjunction with Article 82(2) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on judicial cooperation in criminal matters relevant to addressing trafficking in human beings and victims‚Äô rights. The provisions of the draft Protocol other than the provisions related to judicial cooperation in criminal matters will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision. The Decision recommends that Member States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: energy labelling enables customers to obtain accurate, relevant and comparable information on the energy efficiency and consumption of energy related products wherever they are in the Union allowing them to take informed cost-effective and environmentally friendly purchasing decisions that are both good for the environment and save money. On 25 February 2015, the Commission announced in its Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union a review of Directive 2010/30/EU on the Energy Labelling Directive in order to further exploit the potential of energy efficiency for the moderation of energy demand and consequent reduction of the energy dependency of the European Union. Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council was evaluated for its effectiveness. The evaluation identified the need to update the Energy Labelling framework to improve its effectiveness. For 2030 the European Council set in October 2014 an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency which will be reviewed by 2020, having in mind an EU level of 30%. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looks at both a number of issues with the current Directive and some specific items concerning the Ecodesign Directive. The two most important issues concerning the Energy Labelling Directive were: reduced effectiveness of the energy label and non-compliance due to weak enforcement; long rulemaking processes, leading to outdated technical and preparatory work. The final option chosen was to: (i) improve the existing regulatory framework on energy labelling, (ii) require labelled products to be registered in a new database,(iii) improve the legal structure by changing the current Energy Labelling Directive to a Regulation, to align it with the market surveillance regulation, and to, (iv) fund EU joint market surveillance actions. CONTENT: this proposal follows up on the Energy Union Framework Strategy and intends to replace Directive 2010/30/EU on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products by a Regulation. In the proposal, the objectives and main principles of the current Energy Labelling Directive are retained but the proposal clarifies, strengthens and extends the scope of the current Directive's provisions by: (1) Updating the label and allowing for rescaling : the success of energy labelling means that the label is running into its limits. Although A+ to A+++ energy efficiency classes were added in 2010, for some product groups, all models are already in those new classes and there are no longer any models in the lower classes. There is a systematic need to 'rescale' products and to go back to the original A to G energy label scale, which studies suggest is the one best understood by consumers. Although the current Directive allows for the possible reclassification of products through specific delegated acts, the current proposal deals with the need to rescale the energy labels in a much more systematic manner. It also makes clear the obligations on suppliers and dealers during the rescaling and replacement phase. The existing labels will be reviewed by the Commission within five years of the entry into force of the Regulation, with a view to rescaling them. The delegated act would contain a specific date by which the 'old' labels would have to be replaced with the rescaled label (the ""replacement date""). During a transitional period, dealers would be required to replace the old label with the new one on all products on display in shops . They would have one week to replace all labels with the new ones. Member States would be required to run promotional information campaigns to inform consumers of the rescaling exercise. (2) Creating a database of products covered by energy labelling obligations : overall non-compliance in the market is estimated at 20%, leading to some 10% of envisaged energy savings being lost. The new product registration database: (i) will allow market surveillance authorities much quicker access to the necessary information; (ii) will provide up-to-date market data and energy efficiency information which will accelerate the preparatory/review studies and subsequent regulatory process. The proposal also updates the Directive's requirements in terms of providing for electronic supply of labels or for suppliers to make them available on their websites. The administrative burden for registering products is estimated at EUR 1.5 million per year for the entire industry; about 0.5 eurocent per product sold. (3) Making clearer the obligations of the various parties: the proposal regroups the respective obligations on Member States, suppliers and dealers in order to make these more coherent and simpler. The replacement of the Directive with a Regulation means less administrative burden for Member States and directly applicable requirements for suppliers and dealers which will ensure a complete harmonisation across the EU. (4) Improving the link between energy labelling and measurement standards : the proposal makes clear that a product which complies with the measurement and calculation methods set out in the relevant harmonised standard will be presumed to comply with the relevant provisions of the applicable delegated act. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this initiative does not require additional EU budgetary resources. The costs concern: setting up a products database (1.500.000 EUR in 2016 and 150.000 EUR yearly maintenance cost in subsequent years); consumer understanding studies for labels for specific product groups (300.000 EUR per year from 2017). These are financed through reprioritisation of existing budget for the implementation of the policy on energy efficiency of products. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. CONTENT: this legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency. The proposal stipulates that the EMSA shall, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level by: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by Member States; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building by elaborating guidelines , recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around EUR 22 million per year (that is around EUR 87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA staff. This is operational expenditure for around EUR 81 million mainly to cover provision of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) services for border control surveillance (EUR 67 million) and satellite aerial surveillance (SAT-AIS) and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency established, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and the European Council support the national authorities in the exercise of most of these functions. They should therefore strengthen their cooperation with each other and with those national authorities carrying out coastguard functions in order to increase the maritime situational awareness and to support coherent and cost-efficient action. CONTENT: the purpose of this legislative proposal is to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant Member States' authorities, EU agencies and other bodies performing coastguard functions with a view to moving towards a European Coastguard Capacity/System. It forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and a proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The substantive amendments in this proposal are identical to the proposed amendments to the Regulation establishing EMSA and the proposed provisions on European coastguard cooperation in the proposal for a Regulation establishing European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The proposed Regulation covers: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the Agencies. It will foster intelligence sharing amongst the Agencies; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building at national and Union level by elaborating guidelines, recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhance the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions. Thanks to its international mandate, the EFCA has, so far, developed robust expertise in implementing common inspection platforms and maintains privileged network with EU and third countries such as Albania, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. It will permit the EFCA to increase its control and inspection activities and conduct new type of operations aiming at detecting criminal activities, disrupt trafficking routes and ensure the enforcement of EU and national legislations. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative will imply an increase in the EU contribution to the EFCA of around EUR 7.5 million per year (that is EUR 30.148 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 13 TA staff."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the new OLAF Regulation (Regulation 883/2013), the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office is tasked with regularly monitoring the implementation by the Office of its investigative function, in order to reinforce its independence, and in particular to monitor developments concerning the application of procedural guarantees and the duration of investigations in the light of the information supplied by the Director General. However, in the recent past some concerns have been voiced about possible conflicts of interest and calls have been made for a strengthened legal independence as regards the management of the Committee's budget and secretariat. Thus, in its Annual Activity Reports of 2013 and 2014, the Supervisory Committee underlined the importance of its independent and effective functioning which requires an independent and adequately staffed secretariat. The European Parliament called several times on the Commission to take measures to reinforce the independent functioning of OLAF's Supervisory Committee secretariat, such as in its report on the discharge procedure for 20134 or in its resolution on the OLAF Supervisory Committee's annual report 2014. On 18 December 2015, the Commission adopted an amendment to its Decision 1999/352 in order to move the responsibility for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations for the Members from the Director-General of OLAF to the Commission. The Commission subsequently delegated this responsibility to the Director of its Payments Office (PMO). The framework for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations relating to the Members of the Supervisory Committee should be set up in a way which avoids any appearance of a possible interference of the Office in their duties. The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee should be provided directly by the Commission, independently from the Office. The Commission should refrain from interfering with the functions of the Supervisory Committee. CONTENT: in order to separate the management of the Committee's secretariat from the management of the Office and to avoid any impression that OLAF can impair the functioning of the support to the Committee's Members, the Commission proposes to modify Regulation 883/2013 to foresee that the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be provided directly by the Commission, and no longer by OLAF. Lastly, the proposal seeks to amend the wording of Regulation so that the competence of OLAF's Data Protection Officer (DPO) will continue to cover the processing of data by the secretariat. Also, the secretariat's staff will continue to be subject to the same confidentiality rules as before. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation will not require any new human or administrative resources and will have no financial impact. It will only transfer the management of the budgetary appropriations concerning the secretariat of OLAF's Supervisory Committee within the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Peru. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Peruvian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Peruvians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru. On 19 May 2015, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations with Peru were opened on 20 May 2015 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Peru on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Peru when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Peru may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Peru to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Peru remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Peru to stay only in those Member States‚Äô European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the emissions limits for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) are currently set out in Directive 97/68/EC. This Directive was amended a number of times, but several technical reviews have concluded that the legislation in its current form has shortcomings. Non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) covers a large variety of combustion engines installed in machines ranging from small handheld equipment, construction machinery and generating sets, to railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels. These engines contribute significantly to air pollution and are accountable for roughly 15% of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 5% of the particulate matter (PM) emissions in the EU. The proposal also ties in with the industrial policy update of 2012 and could make an important contribution to technical harmonisation in the context of the EU-US trade negotiations (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - TTIP). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment took into account in the analytical design that the preferred choice might be a combination of elements from different options. Alongside the no-policy change scenario, these options are: alignment with US standards in scope and limit values. step towards road sector ambition levels, for the most relevant emission sources. extended level of ambition through enhanced monitoring provisions. CONTENT: the proposal significantly upgrades the NRMM engine type-approval system with respect to the technical requirements on emissions by adopting stricter levels, as well as introducing the ‚Äúsplit-level approach‚Äù which is already used in other pieces of legislation in the area of EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach foresees legislation in two steps: first, the fundamental provisions will be laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on the ordinary legislative procedure; secondly, the technical specifications implementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU. The draft proposal and its implementing and delegated acts will carry over and improve on the existing requirements laid down in Directive 97/68/EC. Compared to the existing act, the proposal for a regulation will: introduce new emission limits reflecting technological progress and EU policies in the on-road sector, with a view to achieving EU air quality targets; extend the scope , with a view to improving market harmonisation (EU and international) and minimising the risk of market distortions; introduce measures for simplifying administrative procedures and improving enforcement, including conditions for better market surveillance. In particular, the delegated acts adopted under this proposal will include, amongst others: detailed technical requirements of the test cycles; technical test and measurement procedures; detailed arrangements and requirements for the exceptions granted under this Regulation; detailed provisions for type-approval procedures. The proposal also provides general and specific transitional periods in order to allow sufficient lead time for engine and machinery manufacturers, as well as for administrations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the cost associated to setting up an electronic database for the exchange of type-approval information was already assessed in a feasibility study commissioned by the UNECE in June 2006. The study predicted one off start-up costs in the EUR 50 000 to EUR 150 000 range and operating costs of EUR 5 000 to EUR 15 000 per month, depending on the length of the contract with the service provider. A similar monthly range is provided for operating a help desk service, if required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the entry into force of the new substantial provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down Union Customs Code (UCC) in May 2016, the process of regular consultation with Member States and business has resulted in the identification of errors and technical anomalies that need to be corrected in order to ensure legal certainty and consistency. The Commission has therefore prepared this proposal to amend the UCC with a view to correcting these technical errors and omissions, including the alignment of the UCC with an international agreement that was not in force at the time of adoption of the UCC, namely, the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). The proposal also aims at addressing a request from Italy to include the municipality of Campione d'Italia and the Italian waters of Lake Lugano in the EU customs territory. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the following amendments to the provisions of the UCC: amend the definition of the customs territory of the Union to include the Italian municipality of Campione d'Italia and the Italian waters of Lake Lugano within its scope. The inclusion of these territories in the customs territory of the Union should apply from 1 January 2019; specify that the holder of a binding tariff information (BTI) decision may use that decision for up to six months after the decision has been revoked if the revocation results from the fact that the decision was not in conformity with customs legislation or that the conditions laid down for issuing the decision were not or no longer fulfilled; add temporary storage to the list of customs formalities covered by the provision that extinguishes a debt due to non-compliance in cases where there was no significant negative effect, no attempt at deception and the situation was subsequently regularised; clarify that, where customs authorities must invalidate an entry summary declaration due to the fact that the goods covered by the declaration have not been brought into the customs territory of the Union, the entry summary declaration should be invalidated without delay 200 days after the declaration was lodged rather than within 200 days as that is the period within which the goods must be brought into the customs territory of the Union; clarify that economic operators provide them with pre-arrival data concerning non-Union goods in the form of an entry summary declaration. Where an entry summary declaration has not been lodged before the arrival of the goods and the obligation to lodge it has not been waived, economic operators should submit the data normally included in entry summary declarations in their customs declarations or temporary storage declarations; clarify that, in cases where customs authorities have to invalidate a temporary storage declaration due to non-presentation of the relevant goods, the invalidation must happen once 30 days have elapsed since the declaration was lodged rather than ""within"" the period of 30 days; clarify that, in cases where customs authorities have to invalidate an exit summary declaration or reexport notification due to the non-export of the relevant goods, the invalidation must happen once 150 days have elapsed since the declaration or notification was lodged rather than ""within"" the period of 150 days; add a new provision in order to provide total relief from import duty for goods that have been repaired or altered under the outward processing procedure in a country with which the Union has concluded a preferential agreement (like CETA with Canada) providing for such relief."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers it necessary to make certain amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (Rural Development Regulation) to ensure policy continuity in the final years of the programming period and to ensure a smooth transition to the next programming period. In relation to direct payments, some of the provisions in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 (Direct Payment Regulation) do not cover calendar year 2020 since expenditure relating to calendar year 2020 is made in financial year 2021, which is the first year of the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. Those Member States would be faced with important changes in their direct payments and rural development envelopes with considerable effects on the payments to farmers under both pillars. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuity of support to European farmers in the years 2019 and 2020 by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 and direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. As regards support for rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (EAFRD), the proposal relates to financial years 2019 ‚Äì 2021, whereas the proposed modifications for direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 relate to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. Rural development : the proposal makes it possible for the Member States to modify the degressivity schedule for payments to areas, which had received such payments in the previous programming period, while in the ongoing period, not being classified anymore as areas facing natural constraints other than mountain areas pursuant to the Rural Development Regulation. This modification would allow calculating transitional payments for the years 2019 and 2020 based on payment levels of the 2014-2020 period. The proposal extends the use of the technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to actions related to the preparation of the future CAP. The proposal concerns exclusively the scope of technical assistance without modifying the financial support. Flexibility between pillars in year 2020 and transfer of the product of reduction of direct payments to Rural development : flexibility between pillars is an optional transfer of funds between direct payments and rural development. The proposal includes provisions regarding the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between pillars in calendar year 2020 (corresponding to financial year 2021). It calls for a transfer between pillars to remain possible in calendar year 2020 under the same conditions as currently standing and that the estimated product of reduction continues to be transferred from direct payments to rural development. In order to promptly provide the necessary flexibility to the Member States and to ensure the continuity of the rural development policy in the final years of the 20142020 programming period, this Regulation should apply from 1 March 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any financial implications in terms of increased expenditure. The effect of the proposed provisions giving Member States an option to transfer amounts between direct payments allocations in calendar year 2020/financial year 2021 and EAFRD in financial year 2021 as well as the transfer of the estimated product of reduction from direct payments in calendar year 2020 to EAFRD in financial year 2021 will depend on Member States‚Äô implementation and can therefore not be quantified at present. Such transfers will in any case remain neutral with regard to overall commitment appropriations in the way that any deductions from the direct payments allocations will be off-set by a corresponding increase in the EAFRD allocations and vice versa."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the .eu Top Level Domain (.eu TLD) is the domain name of the European Union and its citizens. The existence of a specific domain name for the Union under a clear and recognisable common label is an important and valuable building block for a Union online identity. The .eu top-level domain (TLD) was set up by Regulation (EC) No 733/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council. It is further governed by the rules provided in Commission Regulation (EC) No 874/2004. Since the adoption of the .eu Regulations, the political and legislative context in the Union and the online environment and market have changed considerably. The review of the.eu TLD regulations under the Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT) has shown that although the.eu TLD continues to function properly, the legal framework governing it is outdated and rigid: some signs indicate a relative decline in performance of the.eu TLD; due to the degree of complexity and detail of its provisions, the.eu TLD does not allow the implementation of operational or technical changes as swiftly as the market demands; the current framework does not reflect the Union‚Äôs current priorities, such as the digital single market, and the.eu TLD regulations do not reflect international best practice in multi-stakeholder governance. In line with the objectives of the Digital Single Market Strategy, the present initiative seeks to ensure that a TLD that has worked relatively well continues to do so in the future in order to ensure that the benefits linked to it can reach as many Union citizens as possible in the near future. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is the ‚Äòseparate governance‚Äô option together with lifting strict requirements for direct registration, a citizenship criterion for natural persons and a residency criterion for organisations and companies. This option would provide the necessary flexibility for the .eu TLD to adapt to rapidly changing technical improvements to the Domain Name System and improve the functioning of the .eu TLD and therefore increase its attractiveness in the Top Level Domain market. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal to repeal Regulation (EC) No 733/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Regulation (EC) No 874/2004 is to implement the .eu country code Top Level Domain (‚ÄòccTLD‚Äô) and lay down the conditions for its implementation. The implementation of the .eu Top Level Domain name : the proposal lays out the general principles of registration of a .eu Top Level Domain name: it outlines the eligibility criteria, the general conditions of registration and revocation of domain names, the languages, the applicable law and the jurisdiction, the procedures for the reservation of domain names by the Registry, the Commission and Member States, and the accreditation procedures for Registrar. Registration of one or more domain names under the .eu TLD can be requested by any of the following: a Union citizen, independently of their place of residence ; or a natural person who is not a Union citizen and who is resident of a Member State; or an undertaking established within the Union ; or an organisation established within the Union without prejudice to the application of national law. Registry : the provisions span from its designation by the Commission and characteristics to its key obligations. The proposal also lays down a list of principles and procedures on the functioning of the .eu TLD to be included in the contract with the Registry, including the following: an alternative dispute resolution policy; requirements and procedures for registration requests, policy on verification of registrants data and speculative registration of domain names; policy on abusive registration of domain names and on revocation of domain names; treatment of intellectual property rights. The oversight of the Registry operator : the provisions on the supervisory powers of the Commission and establishment of a .eu Multistakeholder Council provide the basis for this group to advise the Commission on strengthening and widening input into the good governance of the .eu Registry and increase the transparency of its functioning. The .eu Multistakeholder Council shall be composed of representatives drawn from the private sector, the technical community, Member States and international organisations, civil society and academia and appointed by the Commission on the basis of an open and transparent procedure. In order to limit any risks of disruption of services of the .eu TLD in the shifting between the old and new regulatory framework, a maximum period of three years from the date of entry into force of the Regulation is foreseen for its entry into application. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the .eu Multistakeholder Council needs to be appropriately resourced. The cost is estimated around EUR 50 000 per year. The new body will be financially sustained by the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: gross national income (GNI) constitutes the basis for calculating the largest share of own resources in the budget of the European Union. The new ‚Äòown resources decision,‚Äô Council Decision 2014/335/EU, Euratom on the system of own resources of the European Union entered into force on 1 October 2016. This Decision states that for own resources purposes, the GNI of Members States shall be defined in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 549/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European system of national and regional accounts in the European Union (ESA 2010). In September 2014, ESA 2010 became the new standard for calculating national accounts in the EU. In order to enhance the comparability, reliability and exhaustiveness of the GNI aggregate, the Commission considers it necessary to revise Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1287/2003 on the harmonisation of income (GNI Regulation) in order to align the GNI with Regulation (EU) No 549/2013, the legal basis of which is also Article 338(1) of the TFEU, which constitutes the legal basis for European statistics. The proposal follows on from the recommendations in the Court of Auditors' special report No 11/2013 entitled 'Getting the Gross National Income (GNI) data right' and the Commission's communication on the production method of EU statistics: a vision for the next decade. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation, repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1287/2003 (the 'GNI Regulation'), is a simple update of the existing system. It provides that gross national income at market prices (GNI) and gross domestic product at market prices (GDP) shall be defined in accordance with the European system of national and regional accounts (ESA 2010), set up by Regulation (EU) No 549/2013. To emphasise statistical integrity when compiling and harmonising GNI, the legal basis shall be Article 338(1) TFEU. The proposed changes to the situation under the GNI Regulation consist of adapting the GNI data reporting to ESA 2010 and introducing the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the relevant comitology committee instead of the GNI Committee as part of a new ESS structure. According to the Commission, the proposal imposes less of a burden on Member States than the current situation because without a switch to ESA 2010 for own resources, Member States could be required to produce a double set of accounts, one on ESA 2010 and one on ESA 95."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the Commission carried out, in 2016, a review of the total amounts allocated to Member States for the ‚ÄúInvestment for Growth and Jobs‚Äù goal of cohesion policy for 2017-2020, The Commission presented in its communication of 30 June 2017 the results of this review to the Council and the European Parliament. The review indicated that: on the basis of the most recent statistics, there is a cumulative divergence of more than +/‚Äì 5 % between the total and the revised allocations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom ; on the basis of its gross national income (GNI) per capita figures of 2012-2014, Cyprus will become fully eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as of 1 January 2017. The review of the total amounts allocated also includes the decision to extend the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) to the years 2017 to 2020. The Council decided to extend the YEI until 2020 with an amount of EUR 1.2 billion in current prices for the specific allocation for the YEI, which needs to be complemented by at least EUR 1.2 billion from targeted ESF investment. Insofar as the revision had an impact on the annual breakdown of the allocations for the global resources by Member State under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and under the European Territorial Cooperation Goal as well as on the Youth Employment Initiative, it was implemented by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1941. The total net effect of those adjustments is to increase the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion by EUR 4 billion. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2016 needs to be amended accordingly. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 includes: regulatory provisions regarding the review of the allocations of cohesion policy for the years 2017-2020; the decisions to transfer resources between categories and goals; the decision to extend the YEI to the years 2017 to 2020 and the decision to transfer some commitment appropriations of 2014 to subsequent years. In terms of the amendments proposed, the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment will be EUR 329 978 401 458, of which: EUR 325 938 694 233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund and EUR 4 039 707 225 represents a specific allocation for the YEI. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to adjust: the resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and their allocation between less developed regions, transition regions, more developed regions, Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund and outermost regions; resources for the European territorial cooperation goal. Furthermore, an amount of EUR 9 446 050 652 in current prices of the allocation provided for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund which could not be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015 will be transferred to subsequent years. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is an impact on commitment appropriations equal to EUR 4 billion. These additional resources will also generate needs for additional payment appropriations for the years 2018 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in the aftermath of the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007-2008, the Union implemented a substantial reform of the financial services regulatory framework to enhance the resilience of its financial institutions. That reform was largely based on internationally agreed standards. Among its many measures, the reform package included the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council, which strengthened the prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms. While the reform has rendered the financial system more stable and resilient against many types of possible future shocks and crises, it did not address all identified problems. In its Communication of 24 November 2015, the Commission recognised the need for further risk reduction and committed bringing forward a legislative proposal that would build on internationally agreed standards. The need to take further concrete legislative steps in terms of reducing risks in the financial sector has also been recognised also by the Council in its Conclusions of 17 June 2016 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 10 March 2016. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment, rejected on 7 September 2016, was subsequently strengthened by adding: (i) a better explanation on the policy context of the proposal (i.e. it relation to both international and EU policy developments); (ii) more details on stakeholders' views; (iii) further evidence on the impacts of the various policy options that are explored. As shown by the simulation analysis and macroeconomic modelling developed in the impact assessment, there are limited costs to be expected from the introduction of the new requirements, in particular the new Basel standards such as the leverage ratio and the trading book. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) is part of a legislative package that includes also amendments to Directive 2013/36/EU (the Capital Requirements Directive or CRD), to Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD), and to Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation or SRMR). It aims to complete the reform agenda by tackling remaining weaknesses and implementing some outstanding elements of the reform that are essential to ensure the institutions' resilience but have only recently been finalised by global standard setters (i.e. the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB)): a binding leverage ratio which will prevent institutions from excessively increasing leverage, e.g. to compensate for low profitability; a binding net stable funding ratio (NSFR) which will build on institutions‚Äô improved funding profiles and establish a harmonised standard for how much stable, long-term sources of funding an institution needs to weather periods of market and funding stress; more risk sensitive own funds (i.e. capital) requirements for institutions that trade to an important extent in securities and derivatives which will prevent too much divergence in those requirements that is not based on the institutions' risk profiles; new standards on the total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) of global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs) which will require those institutions to have more loss-absorbing and recapitalisation capacity; the introduction of more accurate reporting of the risks to which banks are exposed. In order to improve the lending capacity of banks to support the EU economy, the proposal aims in particular at: enhancing the capacity of banks to lend to SMEs and to fund infrastructure projects . As far as SMEs are concerned, the proposed recalibration of the own funds requirements for bank exposures to SMEs is expected to have a positive effect on bank financing of SMEs. This would primarily affect SMEs which currently have exposures beyond EUR 1.5 million as these exposures do not benefit from the SME Supporting Factor under the existing rules; applying the current framework in a more proportionate manner, taking into account the situation of non-complex, small banks, reducing the administrative burden linked to some rules in the area of remuneration (namely those on deferral and remuneration using instruments, such as shares), which appear disproportionate for these banks; ensuring a smooth interaction with existing requirements such as for central clearing and collateralisation of derivatives exposures, or a gradual transition to some of the new requirements are necessary. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to address the EU‚Äôs need for a stronger Europe when it comes to foreign policy to better contribute to supporting development and securing peace and prosperity in the world. The Commission stated that it is essential to support security sector actors, including the military under exceptional circumstances, in third countries in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Those actions are particularly necessary to ensure the protection of civilian populations in the areas affected by conflict, crises or fragility. The 2005 European Consensus on Development recognised the link between security and development. The United Nations‚Äô 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015, underlined the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 16) and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes. In the Joint Communication entitled ‚ÄòCapacity building in support of security and development ‚Äì Enabling partners to prevent and manage crisis‚Äô, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy reiterated the need for stable and secure societies in order to achieve development objectives The Council conclusions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of 18 May 2015 called to explore options to: (i) enhance coherence and coordination between EU security and development actions, as well as to; (ii) improve the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development, notably in terms of financing instruments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that an amendment of the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) would be the most appropriate and effective short-term option. It also explained that a comprehensive implementation of the CBSD initiative (i.e. including support to the military for defence-related purposes) would require combining a budgetary instrument (for development tasks) with another, possibly extra-budgetary, mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal aims to insert a new Article into Title II of Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 in order to extend the Union‚Äôs assistance under exceptional circumstances to be used to build the capacity of military actors. The specific objectives of the proposal are to: contribute to improving the capacity of partner countries to prevent and manage crises by themselves; contribute to improving the effectiveness of the Union‚Äôs development actions by working with all security actors, including the military, through the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development by the EU, as soon as possible, flexibly and comprehensively; contribute to ensuring the respect of the rule of law, good governance as well as enhanced civilian control and oversight over the military in third countries. Types of Union assistance : Union assistance may be used to build the capacity of military actors in partner countries under exceptional circumstances, in order to contribute to sustainable development and in particular to the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies. The type of activities that may be supported include capacity building programmes in support of security and development, including training, mentoring and advice, as well as the provision of equipment, infrastructure improvements and provision of other services. Union assistance shall not be used to finance: (i) recurrent military expenditure; (ii) the procurement of arms and ammunition; (iii) training which is solely designed to contribute to the fighting capacity of the armed forces. Exceptional circumstances : assistance shall only be provided in the following circumstances: where requirements cannot be met by recourse to non-military actors to adequately reach Union objectives under this Regulation; where the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies is denied by a serious threat to the existence of functioning State institutions, as well as to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or State institutions can no longer cope with this serious threat; and where a consensus exists between the country concerned and the international community and/or the European Union that the security sector, and in particular the military, are key for stability, peace and development, particularly in crises and fragile contexts and situations. When designing and implementing measures, the Commission shall: (i) promote ownership by the partner country; (ii) develop the necessary elements and the good practices required for ensuring sustainability in the medium and long term and; (iii) promote the rule of law and established international law principle. Monitoring and evaluation procedures : Union assistance may be provided through exceptional assistance measures and interim response programmes, thematic strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes. Thematic strategy papers shall provide a framework for cooperation between the Union and the partner countries or regions concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in terms of cost, a budget of EUR 100 000 000 over the period 2017-2020 would be required. The initiative will be financed through redeployment within Heading IV of the general budget of the Union. No additional resources would be mobilised. Implementation will be governed by Regulation (EU) No 236/2014."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: following the adoption of the total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) standard by the G20, and in order to facilitate a more efficient path towards compliance with TLAC, a number of EU Member States have amended (or are in the process of amending) the ranking of creditor claims under their national insolvency law, creating significant divergences. Such discrepancies have the potential to amplify uncertainty for debt issuers, investors and resolution authorities and to make the application of the bail-in tool in cross-border resolution cases legally more complex and less transparent. At the same time, the buyer side would experience information asymmetry among different EU jurisdictions, rendering the process of pricing the risk more cumbersome. The resulting uncertainty could also trigger competitive distortions because unsecured debt holders could be treated differently in different Member States and the Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL) compliance costs for banks may be different according to the location of the issuance. In its Communication of 24 November 2015, the Commission recognised the need for further risk reduction and committed bringing forward a legislative proposal that would build on internationally agreed standards. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: several policy alternatives were considered. The impact assessment concludes that the creation of a specific 'unpreferred' senior class for unsecured debt is the most cost effective way to comply with the requirement of subordination of the TLAC standard for G-SIIs and with the case-by-case request of resolution authorities to request compliance with the MREL through subordinated debt. CONTENT: the proposed amendments to Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive or BRRD) propose a harmonised national insolvency ranking of unsecured debt instruments to facilitate banks' issuance of such loss absorbing debt instruments. This would enable banks to issue debt in a new statutory category of unsecured debt available in all EU Member States which would rank just below the most senior debt and other senior liabilities for the purposes of resolution, while still being part of the senior unsecured debt category (only as an un-preferred tier senior debt). Clear, harmonised rules on the position of bond holders in the bank creditors' hierarchy in insolvency and resolution could facilitate the way bail-in is applied, by providing greater legal certainty and reducing the risk of legal challenges. The EU harmonised approach will not affect the existing stock of bank debt and will apply to any new issuance of bank debt in the relevant category following the date of application of this amendment as provided in the proposal. These proposed amendments to Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive) are part of a legislative package that includes also amendments to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation), to Directive 2013/36/EU (the Capital Requirements Directive) and to Regulation (EU) 806/2014 (the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU-Moldova Association Agreement was signed on 24 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied from 1 September 2014. This Agreement includes: a bilateral safeguard clause which allows for the temporary suspension of preferences in case their application would result in an unexpected and significant increase of imports causing economic damage to the domestic industry of the importing party. In concrete terms, this instrument makes it possible to either suspend the further tariff liberalization or reintroduce the most favoured nation (MFN) customs duty rate; a so-called anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the possibility to reintroduce the MFN customs duty rate when imports of certain agricultural goods from Moldova exceed a given threshold without due justification of their exact origin. The Commission considered it necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism. An implementing regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council is necessary to put in place in the EU‚Äôs internal legislation the necessary instrument to be able to apply the bilateral safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism of the Agreement already concluded with the Republic of Moldova. Safeguard measures : safeguard measures may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products. The maximum duration of safeguard measures is determined and specific provisions regarding extension and review of such measures are laid down. Initiating an investigation : the tasks of following up and reviewing the Agreement, carrying out investigations and, if necessary, imposing safeguard measures should be carried out in the most transparent manner possible. The Commission should receive information including available evidence from the Member States of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. If there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of proceedings, the Commission should publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Investigations : the proposal provides that there should be detailed provisions on the initiation of investigations, access to and inspections by interested parties of the information gathered, hearings for the interested parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views. It also sets time limits for the initiation of an investigation and for determinations as to whether or not safeguard measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. An investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure. Anti-circumvention mechanism : the proposed Regulation provides for the possibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the annual import volumes defined in the Association Agreement. Implementation : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the adoption of provisional and definitive safeguard measures, for the imposition of prior surveillance measures and for the termination of an investigation without measures provided for in the Agreement, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases a delay in the imposition of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair or in order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements applying to 'L-category vehicles' as of 1 January 2016 are set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and its four delegated and implementing acts. The term ‚ÄòL-category vehicles‚Äô covers a wide range of light vehicle types with two, three or four wheels, e.g. powered cycles, two- and three-wheel mopeds, two- and three-wheel motorcycles, motorcycles with side-cars and four-wheel vehicles (quadricycles) such as onroad quads, all-terrain vehicles and quadrimobiles. On the basis of the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council on the comprehensive effect study of the environmental step Euro 5 for L-category vehicles and taking into account issues encountered by approval authorities and stakeholders in applying that Regulation, certain changes and clarifications should be made in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 in order to ensure its smooth application. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 168/2013 regarding the requirement to install an on-board diagnostic system (OBD I) which monitors for any electric circuit and electronics failure of the emission control system and which is triggered when the emission thresholds are being exceeded. OBD stage I systems for those vehicle (sub-) categories shall also report the triggering of any operating mode which significantly reduces engine torque. It is necessary to clarify the exemption for mopeds (L1e and L2e categories) from the OBD system of stage II requirement and to extend that exemption to light quadricycles (L6e category) and to the enduro (L3e-AxE) and trial (L3e-AxT) motorcycle subcategories. Regarding the requirement to install an on-board diagnostic system (OBD) of stage II, the Commission concluded on the basis of the comprehensive environmental effect study that there are technical limitations with respect to catalyst monitoring for certain vehicles and that further development is required to ensure its correct implementation. Catalyst monitoring is not expected to be ready for the first round of the Euro 5 emission step, but should be envisaged for 2025. The amending Regulation therefore provides for the time necessary to ensure the correct implementation of OBD system of stage II requirement. In addition, the European Commission would have additional powers to adopt delegated acts to implement Regulation (EC) No 168/2013: the powers initially granted expired on 21 March 2018. The proposal provides for an extension of the delegation for a further five years, with the possibility of tacit extension."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed by an Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The proposed new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. It fully preserves the content of the acts and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Prohibition of exports and imports : the proposed Regulation prohibits exports and imports of goods (listed in Annex II of the Regulation) which have no practical use other than capital punishment or torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It also prohibits a supplier of technical assistance or a broker from supplying or offering such goods to third countries. Furthermore, it prohibit both the promotion of such goods in trade fairs or exhibitions in the Union, and the sale or purchase of advertising space in print media or on the Internet and of advertising time on television or radio in relation to such goods. Obligation of an export licence : for goods which may be used to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (listed in Annex III to the Regulation) or to inflict capital punishment (listed in Annex IV to the Regulation), an export authorisation is required, irrespective of the provenance of the goods. The competent authority shall not grant an authorisation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the goods could be used for the above purposes. Authorisations : authorisations for export, import or transit shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex VII. Authorisations concerning brokering services shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex VIII. Authorisations concerning technical assistance shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex IX. Such authorisations shall be valid throughout the Union. The period of validity of an authorisation shall be from three to twelve months with a possible extension of up to twelve months. The period of validity of a global authorisation shall be from one year to three years with a possible extension of up to two years. The Regulation allows competent authorities to refuse to grant an authorisation and to cancel, suspend, modify or withdraw an authorisation they have already granted. The competent authorities, acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an authorisation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an authorisation which they have already granted. If no authorisation has been granted, the authorities shall detain the goods declared and shall make the exporter or importer aware of the possibility to apply for an authorisation. If no application for an authorisation is made within six months of the detention, or if the competent authority dismisses such an application, the customs authorities shall dispose of the detained goods in accordance with applicable national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: The Commission has committed funds to Member States' national programmes under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece. Decision (EU) 2015/1601 was amended by Council Decision (EU) 2016/1754 to take account of legal admissions from Turkey. The Council decisions allowed the effective relocation, from Greece and Italy, of 34 705 applicants in need of international protection, as well as the legal admission, from Turkey, of 5 345 persons in need of international protection. These decisions have since ceased to apply. Of the EUR 843 million committed in 2016 to Member States' national programmes under the AMIF, some EUR 567 million are still available. However, payments should be made for these commitments before the end of 2018, after which the amounts will no longer be available to Member States for their national programmes under the AMIF. The Commission considers that Member States should be able to use the amounts available to continue to relocate by recommitting these amounts to the same action in national programmes or to allocate these amounts to other actions in the fields of migration and asylum, once the Council decisions are no longer valid. In addition, the target group of persons eligible for relocation should be broadened so that Member States have greater flexibility in the relocations they carry out. The AMIF is an important tool to complement EU actions in the fields of borders and security, in particular because it provides financial support for the establishment and operation of reception and registration centres (hotspots). Member States' needs in these areas remain considerable. CONTENT: The proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) aims to allow Member States to re-commit or transfer amounts within national programmes, through revisions to these national programmes, so as to promote EU priorities in the areas of migration and asylum, including relocation. In practical terms, the proposal: extends the period for the use of the funds concerned - by two years from the date of the approval by the Commission of the revised national programmes - in order to give Member States sufficient time to implement the actions to which the amounts have been re-committed or transferred; extends the target group of persons eligible for resettlement under the current AMIF, i.e. beneficiaries of international protection, to include applicants for international protection who are being transferred; makes it possible to re-commit amounts committed to supporting the implementation of Council decisions for the purpose of relocations, or to transfer these amounts to other actions defined in the Regulation establishing the AMIF, according to the needs of the Member States. Such re-commitment or transfer operations would be possible only once and would have to be duly justified in the context of a revision of the national programmes, which would have to be approved by the Commission; extends by a maximum of six months the deadline for decommitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601, so that Member States have sufficient time to review national programmes and make changes related to possible re-commitments or transfers of amounts."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. On 30 July 2009, the European Union signed the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, which establishes a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement. The Interim Partnership Agreement has been provisionally applied by Papua New Guinea and by Fiji since 20 December 2009 and 28 July 2014, respectively. On 5 February 2018, Samoa submitted an accession request together with a market access offer to the Council. The Commission found Samoa's offer acceptable and concluded negotiations with Samoa on 23 April 2018. Samoa's accession should now be approved on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission invites the Council to approve, on behalf of the Union, Samoa's accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Samoa and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Samoa's exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Samoa from paying customs duties. It satisfies the criteria established in Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 (to eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce with respect to substantially all trade between the parties) i.e.: 80 % of EU exports are covered in 15 years. Samoa will benefit from maintaining their duty-free quota-free market access into the EU market. The EPA also establishes a set of disciplines in the areas of sustainable development; technical barriers to trade; and Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures among others. There is a possibility for the EU to avail itself of the bilateral dispute settlement mechanism foreseen under the Agreement. Samoa graduated from the Least Developed Countries category in 2014; as such it continues to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms' initiative which offers its exports duty-free quotafree market access into the EU for a transitional period ending on 31 December 2018. As of then, the standard form of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) will apply to Samoa's exports to the EU, which is however less generous than the EBA. To maintain full duty-free-quota-free access to the EU market, Samoa would need to have joined the existing EPA between the EU, Fiji and PNG as of 1 January 2019. It is therefore foreseen that the EU and Samoa shall provisionally apply the Agreement subject to notifying each other in writing of the completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose in accordance with Article 76(3) of the Agreement. The scope of the agreement does not cover tax good governance. The Commission will use the context of the EPA Committee meeting to raise with the Samoan authorities their situation towards the EU list, in particular to advocate for tax reforms in line with the EU listing criteria. The proposal provides that the approval of the accession must not be construed as conferring rights or imposing obligations which can be directly invoked before Union or Member State courts or tribunals."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 13 of Regulation 1008/2008 defines the conditions under which lease arrangements of aircraft registered in third countries, especially wet-lease, are allowed. The possibilities are exceptional circumstances, such as a lack of adequate aircraft on the Community market, and they should be strictly limited in time and fulfil safety standards equivalent to the safety rules of Community and national legislation. An Air Transport Agreement (ATA) between the EU and United States was signed in 2007 and amended by a Protocol of 24 June 2010. Accordingly, the ATA foresees an open wet-lease regime between the parties. In order to bring clarity and certainty to the air carriers, the Commission has recommended the Council to authorise it to negotiate a specific wet-lease agreement with the US, aiming at lifting the time restrictions. The present proposal aims to adapt the EU regulation accordingly. CONTENT: the proposal aims to introduce a possibility for derogation from the conditions on wet-leasing set out in Article 13(3)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 through the conclusion of international agreements. This would allow for more flexibility, in so far as the conclusion of such agreements presents economic and social advantages for the EU. The changes proposed add a reference to international agreements to Article 13(3)(b) of the Regulation where conditions to allow wet leasing (extraordinary circumstances, seasonal needs, operational difficulties) are set out. The other provisions of Article 13 (e.g. on safety standards and rights of the competent authority) would remain unchanged."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 543/2014 amending Council Decision 2005/681/JHA, which entered into force on 29 May 2014 transferred the seat of CEPOL from Bramshill in the United Kingdom to Budapest in Hungary. On 27 March 2013, the Commission made a proposal for a Regulation updating the legal framework of the European Police Office (Europol). This proposal pursued several aims, one of which being merging CEPOL with Europol to create synergies between operational law enforcement work and training activities. The European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger of CEPOL with Europol. Instead, a regulation moving the seat of CEPOL as an independent agency to Budapest, Hungary, was adopted on 6 May 2014. Due to the opposition to the proposed merger, other parts of the Europol proposal relating to training were not discussed by the European Parliament and the Council in detail. This proposal for a Regulation draws ‚Äì except as regards the question of merging CEPOL with Europol which has since been decided by the co-legislators ‚Äì on preparatory work carried out in 2011 and 2012 by the Commission on the modernisation of CEPOL's legal basis. It therefore provides for a legal framework for a new CEPOL with broader objectives and modernised governance, which repeals and replaces CEPOL as established by Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted two impact assessments of policy alternatives concerning Europol and CEPOL. The impact assessment on CEPOL was based on the two policy objectives of: (i) ensuring better quality, more joined-up and more consistent training for a wider range of law enforcement officers in cross-border crime issues; (ii) establishing a framework to achieve this in line with the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. The analysis of the overall impact led, in the context of the Europol Regulation proposal, to a preferred policy option which was the merger of CEPOL into Europol. However, given that the European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger in May 2014, this proposal for a regulation accordingly maintains CEPOL as an independent agency, with its seat in Budapest. Any other option would, at this point in time, generate additional costs and create uncertainty for the Agency's future and its staff which would adversely affect its ability to deliver on its objectives. CONTENT: this proposal aims to: give CEPOL the appropriate legal mandate and the necessary resources to implement the training effort set out in the Commission Communication on European Law Enforcement Training Scheme; improve the governance of CEPOL by seeking increased efficiency and aligning it with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. (1) Implementation of a European approach to training : in line with the principles laid down in the Commission communication on the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS), the scope of CEPOL‚Äôs mandate is broadened so that it can support, develop, deliver and coordinate learning activities for law enforcement officials of all ranks (not only police officers of senior rank as is the case under the current CEPOL Decision ) as well as to officers of customs and of other relevant services dealing with cross-border issues. The proposal envisages that the Agency will remain network-based, bringing together the network of training institutes of the Member States for the law enforcement officials and liaising with a single National unit in each Member State. The objectives of CEPOL are updated and clarified so that the Agency may: improve awareness and knowledge of international and Union instruments, the institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union; encourage the development of the regional or bilateral cooperation among the Member States; address specific criminal or policing thematic areas where training at EU level can add value in addition to the national level; provide appropriate and preliminary training sessions for the participation in civilian missions in third Countries. (2) Improved governance : the proposal improves the governance of CEPOL by streamlining procedures, notably with respect to the Management Board and the Executive Director, and by aligning CEPOL with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies, keeping in mind that CEPOL, as a centre of EU learning activities, should continue to rely on the network of the training institutes of the Member States and liaise with a single National unit in each Member State. The Commission and the Member States are represented on the Management Board of CEPOL. Appointment procedure : in line with the mandate of the Agency, the members of the Management Board are appointed on the basis of their knowledge of training for law enforcement officers, taking into account relevant managerial, administrative and budgetary skills. The Management Board will be advised by a scientific committee on technical training issues (Scientific Committee for Training). Management Board tasks : the Management Board is given the necessary powers, in particular to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules and planning documents, establish transparent working procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of CEPOL, adopt the annual activity report, and appoint an Executive Director. In order to ensure efficient day-to-day functioning of CEPOL, the Executive Director is its legal representative and manager. The Executive Director is completely independent in the performance of his/her tasks and ensures that CEPOL carries out the tasks foreseen in this Regulation. In particular, the Executive Director is responsible for preparing budgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management Board. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the adoption of this Regulation will have no additional financial implication. An estimated EUR 6.092 million of staff costs (excl. schooling fees) will be saved over the period 2016-2020 as a result of the relocation from Bramshill to Budapest and the difference in the correction coefficient between the United Kingdom and Hungary. Schooling fees for children of CEPOL‚Äôs staff will constitute an additional cost of EUR 1.868 million over the same period. An estimated EUR 0.658 million will be saved as a result of lower costs of building, equipment and management board expenses over the same period. The relocation of around 40 staff from CEPOL‚Äôs current site in Bramshill, United Kingdom, to the new site in Budapest, Hungary, will have taken place before this proposal for a Regulation enters into force. In total, therefore, the budgetary impact of the legislative proposal amounts to EUR 45.383 million for CEPOL, as an independent Agency established in Budapest, over the period 2016-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2008 global financial crisis revealed important regulatory gaps in the financial system. It also highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities took place, called ‚Äúshadow banking‚Äù. Confronted with new legislative developments in the banking sector, including structural measures, it is possible that banks will shift parts of their activity into less regulated areas as shadow banking. At the end of 2012 global shadow banking assets accounted for EUR 53 trillion, representing about half the size of the regulated banking system and mainly concentrated in Europe (around EUR 23 trillion) and in the United States (around EUR 19.3 trillion). On 19 March 2012, the Commission published a Green Paper on shadow banking, and on 4 September 2013, it published a Communication on the subject. It stressed that the complex and opaque nature of securities financing transactions (SFTs) makes it difficult to identify counterparties and monitor risk concentration. This also leads to the built-up of excessive leverage in the financial system. A High-Level Expert Group chaired by Erkki Liikanen adopted a report on reforming the structure of the Union banking sector in October 2012. The report recognised the risks of shadow banking activities such as high leverage and pro- cyclicality, and it called for a reduction of the interconnectedness between banks and the shadow banking system, which had been a source of contagion in a system-wide banking crisis. Actions regarding these matters have been international and coordinated through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) which, in August 2013, adopted a policy framework consisting of eleven Recommendations addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. These Recommendations were subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders. In order to closely follow market trends regarding entities whose activities qualify as shadow banking, in particular in the area of securities financing transactions, the Commission feels it necessary to implement transparency requirements. The proposal regarding structural reforms of the EU banking sector, which is presented in a package with this proposal, is the final piece of the new regulatory framework, ensuring that even the largest banks in the EU become less complex and can be effectively resolved, with minimum implications for tax payers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that a combination of different measures is necessary including reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, disclosure on the use of SFTs to fund investors, and the need for prior consent to rehypothecation of the financial instruments. The latter must be transferred to an account opened in the name of the receiving counterparty before rehypothecation can take place. This will ensure that the shadow banking activity of using SFTs is properly supervised and regulated. The use of SFTs as such will not be prohibited nor limited by specific restrictions but be more transparent. CONTENT: the Regulation aims at enhancing financial stability in the EU by means of increasing transparency of certain market activities, such as SFTs, rehypothecation and other financing structures having equivalent economic effect as SFTs. The Regulation introduces measures to improve the transparency in three main areas: (1) the monitoring of the build-up of systemic risks related to SFT transactions in the financial system; (2) the disclosure of the information on such transactions to the investors whose assets are employed in these or equivalent transactions; and (3) the contractual transparency of rehypothecation activities. In practice, the proposed measures will cover the FSB recommendations, these being: The obligation for competent authorities to collect additional data on the use of SFTs: the draft Regulation creates a Union framework under which financial or non-financial counterparties of a SFT will efficiently report the details of the transaction to trade repositories. This information will be centrally stored and easily and directly accessible to the relevant authorities, such as ESMA, ESRB, the ESCB, for the purpose of identification and monitoring of financial stability risks entailed by shadow banking activities of regulated and non-regulated entities. The requirement that requires fund managers be transparent towards their investors: in order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and other financing structures, fund managers should include detailed information on any recourse they have to these techniques in regular reporting intervals. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management or investment companies and AIF managers have to produce will be supplemented by this additional information on the use of SFTs and other financing structures. The requirement for financial intermediaries to provide sufficient disclosure to their clients in relation to re-hypothecation of assets : any rehypothecation should therefore take place only with the express knowledge of inherent risks and prior consent of the providing counterparty in a contractual agreement and should be appropriately reflected in the securities accounts. The counterparty receiving financial instruments as collateral will be allowed to rehypothecate them only with the express consent of the providing counterparty and only after having them transferred to its own account. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal involves the hiring of two new temporary agents at EBA from January 2016. The new tasks will be carried out with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation procedure, and in line with the financial programming for agencies. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 established a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat stocks in the Baltic Sea. The objective of the plan is to ensure that the exploitation of the stocks concerned restores and maintains populations of these stocks above the levels that achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The scientific evaluation of the Bothnian Sea herring stock and the Bothnian Bay herring stock conducted in 2017 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) showed that those two stocks are similar. As a consequence, ICES combined the two stocks into one, changed the boundaries of its geographic distribution area and re-estimated the MSY fishing mortality ranges, as well as the relevant conservation reference points. Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 provides that where, on the basis of scientific advice, the Commission considers that the conservation reference points set out in Annex II to that Regulation no longer correctly express the objectives of the plan, those points, as a matter of urgency, may be submitted for the revision to the European Parliament and the Council. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to urgently amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 to ensure that the fishing opportunities for Gulf of Bothnia herring stocks are determined in accordance with the updated conservation reference points following the scientific evaluation carried out by ICES."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on statistics of goods transport by inland waterways and repealing Council Directive 80/1119/EEC. The proposed new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The main elements of the proposed codified text are as follows: Subject matter : the proposal establishes common rules for the production of European statistics concerning inland waterways transport. It shall enable the Commission to have statistics concerning the transport of goods by inland waterways in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies on the regions and on trans-European networks. Scope : Member States in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1 000 000 tonnes shall supply the data in accordance with the tables in Annexes I to IV to the Regulation. The effect of this Regulation is limited to those Member States where inland waterway transport exists. Pilot studies : the Commission shall ensure that pilot studies are carried out on the availability of statistical data on passenger transport by inland waterways, including cross-border transport services. The Union shall contribute to the cost of implementing these pilot studies. Implementation : the Commission may adopt: implementing acts on data transmission procedures and developing and publishing criteria and methodological requirements to ensure the quality of the data produced; delegated acts to amend the Regulation on increasing the threshold of 1 million tonnes of statistical coverage of inland waterway transport, to adapt the definitions and to adapt the Annexes in order to take account of economic and technical changes affecting definitions adopted at international level."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: under Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/2446, products obtained in Norway, Switzerland or Turkey incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there are to be considered as originating in a beneficiary country, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 45 of that Delegated Regulation (so-called 'cumulation' system). The cumulation system shall apply provided that Switzerland reciprocally grants the same treatment to products originating in the beneficiary countries which incorporate materials originating in the Union. In the case of Switzerland, the cumulation system was originally put in place by means of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Switzerland. That exchange of letters took place on 14 December 2000, following the approval of the Council by Decision 2001/101/EC. In order to ensure the application of a concept of origin corresponding to that set out in the rules of origin in the Union‚Äôs Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), Switzerland has amended its GSP rules of origin. Therefore, the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Switzerland must be revised. The rules of origin in the GSP were reformed in 2010. They provide for the implementation of a new system for the establishment of proofs of origin by registered exporters, which will apply from 1 January 2017.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: under Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/2446, products obtained in Norway, Switzerland or Turkey incorporating materials which have not been wholly obtained there are to be considered as originating in a beneficiary country, provided that such materials have undergone sufficient working or processing within the meaning of Article 45 of that Delegated Regulation (so-called 'cumulation' system). The cumulation system shall apply provided that Norway reciprocally grants the same treatment to products originating in the beneficiary countries which incorporate materials originating in the Union. In the case of Norway, the cumulation system was originally put in place by means of an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Norway. That exchange of letters took place on 29 January 2001, following the approval of the Council by Decision 2001/101/EC. In order to ensure the application of a concept of origin corresponding to that set out in the rules of origin in the Union‚Äôs Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), Norway amended its GSP rules of origin. Therefore, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the Union and Norway must be revised. The rules of origin in the GSP were reformed in 2010. They provide for the implementation of a new system for the establishment of proofs of origin by registered exporters, which will apply from 1 January 2017. In order to anticipate the application of that new system and the rules, on 8 March 2012 the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Norway, in the form of an exchange of letters, on the mutual acceptance of replacement certificates of origin Form A or replacement statements of origin. The negotiations resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Norway which should be approved.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: posting of workers supports the cross-border provision of services in the Internal Market, particularly in construction and some personal and business services sectors. Altogether, in 2014, there were over 1.9 million postings in the EU (representing 0.7% of a total EU labour force), up by 10.3% as compared to 2013 and by 44.4% with respect to 2010. The upward trend followed some stagnation during the years 2009 and 2010. Directive 96/71/EC sets the EU regulatory framework to establish a balance between the objectives of promoting and facilitating the cross-border provision of services, providing protection to posted workers and ensuring a level-playing field between foreign and local competitors. It stipulates a 'core set' of terms and conditions of employment of the host Member State which are mandatory to be applied by foreign service providers, which include: maximum work periods and minimum rest periods; the minimum rates of pay, including overtime rates; minimum paid annual holidays; the conditions of hiring-out of workers; health, safety and hygiene at work; protective measures in favour of pregnant women, mothers who have recently given birth, children, and young people; equality of treatment between genders. The 2014 Enforcement Directive has provided for new and strengthened instruments to fight and sanction circumventions, fraud and abuses. It addresses problems caused by so-called ""letter-box companies"" and increases the Member States‚Äô ability to monitor working conditions and enforce the rules applicable. It also lays down provisions to improve administrative cooperation between national authorities in charge of posting. Moreover, Member States have until 18 June 2016 to transpose the Directive. The current initiative does not address any issue touched upon by the Enforcement Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an Impact Assessment Report which analysis the phenomenon of posting, describes the problem with the current legal framework, envisages different policy options to address it and finally assesses the social and economic impact of the policy options. CONTENT: the proposal of targeted amendments to the Posting of Workers Directive integrates and complements the provisions set in the Enforcement Directive, which is to be transposed by 18 June 2016. It seeks to ensure fair wage conditions to posted workers and a level playing field between posting and local companies in the host country. The new text introduces three main changes: Posting exceeds twenty-four months : the proposal provides the following: when it is anticipated that the duration of posting will be superior to 24 months or when the effective duration of posting exceeds 24 months, the host Member State is deemed to be the country in which the work is habitually carried out; in application of the rules of the Rome I Regulation, the labour law of the host Member Sate will therefore apply to the employment contract of such posted workers if no other choice of law was made by the parties. In case a different choice was made, it cannot, however, have the result of depriving the employee of the protection afforded to him by provisions that cannot be derogated from by agreement under the law of the host Member State; in case of replacement of posted workers performing the same task at the same place, the cumulative duration of the posting periods of the workers concerned shall be taken into account, with regard to workers that are posted for an effective duration of at least six months. Work and employment conditions, including in situations of sub-contracting : the proposed revision: makes the collective agreements universally applicable to posted workers in all sectors of the economy, irrespective of whether the activities are referred to in the annex to the Directive 96/71/EC (which currently is the case only for the construction sector); implies that the rules on remuneration applicable to local workers, stemming from the law or collective agreements universally applicable, are also applicable to posted workers; imposes on Member States an obligation to publish in the website the constituent elements of remuneration applicable to posted workers; gives the faculty to Member States to oblige undertakings to subcontract only to undertakings that grant workers certain conditions on remuneration applicable to the contractor, including those resulting from non-universally applicable collective agreements. This is only possible on a proportionate and non-discriminatory basis and would thus in particular require that the same obligations be imposed on all national sub-contractors. Rules for temporary agency workers : a new provision sets the conditions applicable to the workers hired out by a temporary agency established in a Member State other than the Member State of establishment of the user undertaking. This new measure specifies that the conditions to be applied to cross-border agencies hiring out workers must be those that are applied to national agencies hiring out workers. Contrary to the current Directive, this is now a legal obligation imposed on Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in light of the persistent high levels of youth unemployment in the Union, a Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was established to provide support to 7 million young Europeans not in employment, education or training in the most affected regions. The YEI is integrated in the programming of the European Social Fund (ESF). To ensure a quick response to fighting youth unemployment, Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down general provisions on the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the European Social Funds lay down provisions to allow for a quicker mobilisation of the resources allocated to the YEI, including, inter alia, the commitment of all the resources in the first two years of the programming period. Operations under the YEI therefore have to be implemented, in principle, by the end of 2018 and not 2023 as it is the case for other operations supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), including the European Social Fund. The budgetary constraints faced by Member states and the lack of available funding at the initial stage of the programming period have caused significant delays in the implementation of the YEI. In its Work Programme for 2015, the Commission committed to take initiatives to promote integration and employability in the labour market, including measures to support Member States in getting young people into work. Taking into account the urgent need to address youth unemployment, the Commission states that it is necessary to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to operational programmes supported by the YEI in 2015. CONTENT: it is proposed to introduce an additional provision in Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the additional initial pre-financing for operational programmes supported by the YEI. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) from 1-1.5% as outlined in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to a maximum of 30% of the envelope which is allocated to it for 2015. To ensure that the additional initial pre-financing amount is used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, the proposal foresees that this amount is reimbursed to the Commission, if the Union contribution from the YEI does not amount to an adequate level in interim payment applications submitted to the Commission 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the YEI remains unchanged. The increased need for payment appropriations for the YEI additional initial pre-financing in 2015 will be fully covered by appropriations of the 2015 budget for the YEI specific allocation. Consequently, the proposed modification should not trigger a potential backlog of 2014-2020 unpaid claims."

BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries applies to imports of textile products originating in third countries, with which the European Community has concluded bilateral agreements, signed protocols or made other arrangements. In recent years, the European Union only maintained bilateral agreements on trade in textiles with Russia and Serbia. After Russia's accession to the WTO and the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 lost its main purpose. Moreover, Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 was used to impose quantitative limits to certain textiles products originating from the People's Republic of China during a limited period and to eventually use the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism for China. This mechanism expired on 11 December 2013. Therefore, it is necessary to repeal this Regulation.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Convention of the International Maritime Organisation on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (the 'IMO' and 'the STCW-F Convention' respectively), was adopted on 7 July 1995 at the International Conference convened by the IMO in London at which delegations of 22 attending Member States voted in favour of its adoption. The objective of the STCW-F Convention is to ensure that personnel on board fishing vessels are qualified (as proven by an official certificate) and fit for the job (following medical examination), so that potential threats to safety of life and/or property at sea or to the marine environment are minimised during operations on board sea-going vessels, bearing in mind that fishing at sea is one of the most hazardous professions. Another aim of the Convention is to achieve and maintain a level playing field in the fisheries sector by fostering vocational education. Pursuant to the right of freedom of movement of workers, in matters of professional qualifications, Directive 2005/36/EC sets clear rules on mutual recognition between Member States under the so-called ""general system of recognition"". The Directive applies to EU nationals wishing to pursue a profession in another Member State where this profession is regulated, except where, for a given profession and in accordance of the principle of lex specialis, other specific rules directly related to the recognition of professional qualifications are laid down by a separate piece of legislation under EU law. The STCW-F Convention does not lay down a system of recognition of professional qualifications similar to the one established by Directive 2005/36/EC. On the contrary, the STCW-F Convention does not admit the use of certificates issued by States that are not party to the Convention. However, Member States are under the obligation to comply with EU law, namely to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/36/EC. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice on external competence, the Member States are not allowed to ratify the STCW-F Convention without European Union authorisation as the provisions concerning the recognition of regulated professions pursed by EU nationals on board fishing vessels affect the exercise of the European Union's exclusive competence in this area. As regards those Member States that have already ratified the Convention before the entry into force of the proposed Decision, they are required to deposit with the IMO Secretary-General a statement whereby they acknowledge that EU law shall prevail in case of conflict in relations between Member States. Against this background, it is now appropriate, in the interest of the Common Fisheries Policy, to authorise the Member States to sign and/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2), 46, 53(1) and 62 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Commission proposes that the Member States are authorised to sign and/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation, adopted on 7 July 1995, for the parts falling under the European Union's competence. The authorisation to the Member States shall be granted on condition that they formulate a reservation when depositing their instrument of ratification to the effect that European Union law shall continue to be applied in their mutual relations. Those Member States that have already ratified the Convention, shall submit a statement to the Secretary-General of IMO whereby they state that Union law relating to recognition of professional qualifications applies in relations between Member States. The proposed Decision will therefore enable and encourage Member States to take all the necessary steps for ratification without further delay.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/28/EC (the ""Renewable Energy Directive"") established mandatory targets of 20% overall share of renewable energy in the EU by 2020 and a 10% share for renewable energy in the transport sector. At the same time, an amendment to Directive 98/70/EC (""the Fuel Quality Directive"") introduced a mandatory target of a 6% reduction by 2020 in the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels used in road transport and non-road mobile machinery. The contribution of biofuels towards these targets is expected to be significant. Whilst both Directives include sustainability criteria including minimum greenhouse gas saving thresholds, the greenhouse gas emissions associated with changes in the carbon stock of land resulting from indirect changes in land use (ILUC) are not subject to reporting requirements under the current legislation. The Commission was invited to review the impact of indirect land-use change on greenhouse gas emissions and, if appropriate, propose ways to minimise it whilst respecting existing investments made in biofuels production. The Commission Communication of 2010 identified a number of uncertainties and limitations associated with the available numerical models used to quantify indirect land-use change, whilst acknowledging that indirect land-use change can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions savings associated with biofuels and bioliquids, and as such, recommended that this issue was to be addressed under a precautionary approach. Scientific work indicates that emissions from indirect land-use change can vary substantially between feedstocks and can negate some or all of the greenhouse gas savings of individual biofuels relative to the fossil fuels they replace. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to amend the existing legislation with a view to limiting the contribution that conventional biofuels (with a risk of ILUC emissions) make towards attainment of the targets in the Renewable Energy Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this Commission proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: in order to ensure an increased use of sustainable biofuels to meet the necessary targets, the Commission is proposing to amend the Renewable Energy Directive and the Fuel Quality Directive. 1. Introduction of limits on the contribution that conventional biofuels and bioliquids produced from food crops, such as those based on cereals and other starch rich crops, sugars and oil crops, to the Renewable Energy Directive targets to current consumption levels, without foreseeing any limits on their overall consumption. The Commission is proposing to limit to the current level of consumption, i.e. 5%, the volume of biofuels and bioliquids produced from crops used for food and feed that can be included in the EU‚Äôs 10% target for renewable energy target for 2020 for the transport sector, while maintaining the overall renewable energy and carbon intensity reduction targets. 2. An increase to 60% of the minimum greenhouse gas saving threshold for biofuels and bioliquids produced in new installations, with effect from 1st July 201,4 in order to improve the EU‚Äôs overall greenhouse gas balance, as well as discouraging further investments in installations with low greenhouse gas savings performance. 3. The introduction of the reporting of estimated emissions from carbon stock changes caused by indirect land-use change, based on the best available scientific evidence, for the purposes of the calculation of the life cycle greenhouse gas emission savings from biofuels and bioliquids, in the reports required to be provided by fuel suppliers and the Member States on greenhouse gas emission saving from the use of biofuels and bioliquids. 4. A strengthened incentive mechanism to further promote sustainable and advanced biofuels from feedstocks that do not create an additional demand for land. 5. The simplification of the calculation of greenhouse gas savings for European biofuel producers, levelling the playing field between EU producers and producers in third countries. The proposal also seeks to protect existing investments until 2020. The Commission is of the view that, in the period after 2020, biofuels which do not lead to substantial greenhouse gas savings (when emissions from indirect land-use change are included) and are produced from crops used for food and feed should not be subsidised. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no budgetary implication for the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to permit adaptation to technical and scientific progress, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union will be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 94/62/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council was adopted in order to prevent or reduce the impact of packaging and packaging waste on the environment. Although plastic carrier bags constitute packaging within the meaning of that Directive, its provisions do not contain specific measures relating to the consumption of such bags. The use of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns, which are less frequently re-used than thicker plastic carrier bags, involves a considerable amount of litter, which will increase if measures are not taken. Consumption levels of plastic carrier bags vary considerably across the Union. Some Member States have managed to reduce consumption levels of plastic carrier bags significantly, with the average consumption level in the seven best performing Member States amounting to only 20% of the EU average consumption. To promote similar reductions of the average consumption level of lightweight plastic carrier bags, Member States should take measures to reduce the consumption of plastic carrier bags with a thickness below 50 microns in line with the overall objectives of the Union‚Äôs waste policy and the Union's waste hierarchy as provided for in Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: instead of establishing a common EU target, it was considered preferable to introduce into Directive 94/62/EC the obligation for all Member States to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags, while allowing them to set their own national reduction targets and to choose the measures to reach those targets. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 94/62/EC by requiring Member States to take measures to reduce the consumption of lightweight plastic carrier bags. It stipulates that these measures may include the use of economic instruments as well as marketing restrictions in derogation of Article 18 of the Directive. The latter provision thus broadens the range of instruments available to Member States to address the unsustainable consumption of plastic bags. For the purpose of this Directive a definition of ""lightweight plastic carrier bags"" is introduced, and means bags made of plastic materials with a wall thickness below 50 microns that are supplied to consumers at the point of sale of goods or products."

BACKGROUND: according to the Act of Accession of Croatia, the country is to accede to international agreements signed or concluded by the European Union and its Member States by means of a protocol to those agreements. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Russia, of the other part was signed on 24 June 1994. The Agreement entered into force on 1 December 1997. A Council Decision of 14 September 2012, authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the third countries concerned, in order to conclude the relevant protocols. The negotiations with the Russian Federation were successfully concluded. It is now necessary to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91, 100(2), 207 and 212, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Act of Accession of Croatia. N.B.: the conclusion of the Protocol is subject to a separate procedure as regards matters falling within the competence of the European Atomic Energy Community.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: insolvency matters have a strong Union dimension. An increasingly interconnected single market with stronger digital dimension means that very few companies operate at purely national level. Many investors mention uncertainty over insolvency rules or the risk of lengthy or complex insolvency procedures in another country as a main reason for not investing outside their own country. The 2015 Insolvency Regulation focuses on resolving the conflicts of jurisdiction and laws in cross-border insolvency proceedings, and ensures the recognition of insolvency-related judgments across the EU. It does not harmonise the substantive insolvency laws of the Member States. Reviews of the implementation of the 2014 Recommendation on restructuring and second chance showed that, despite reforms in the area of insolvency, the latter has not led to the desired impact in terms of consistent changes across all Member States that would facilitate the rescue of businesses in financial difficulty and give a second chance to entrepreneurs. There are still several Member States where a business cannot be restructured before it is insolvent. As regards the second chance, important discrepancies have remained as to the duration of the discharge period. Such differences in Member States' legal frameworks mean continuing legal uncertainty, additional costs for investors in assessing their risks, less developed capital markets and persisting barriers to the efficient restructuring of viable companies in the EU, including cross-border enterprise groups. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered in the impact assessment. The selected option was to set up a harmonised minimum legal framework for restructuring and second chance for entrepreneurs, with a non-binding provision on second chance for consumers, and to make procedures more efficient. CONTENT : The proposed directive lays down rules on: 1) Preventive restructuring procedures available for debtors in financial difficulty when there is a likelihood of insolvency. This will help companies continue their activity and preserve jobs. Companies in financial difficulties, especially SMEs, will have access to early warning tools to detect a deteriorating business situation and ensure restructuring at an early stage. Flexible preventive restructuring frameworks will simplify lengthy, complex and costly court proceedings. Where necessary, national courts must be involved to safeguard the interests of stakeholders. The duration of the stay of individual enforcement actions will be limited to a maximum period of no more than four months, with an extension possible in prescribed cases 2) Procedures leading to a discharge of debts incurred by over-indebted entrepreneurs and allowing them to take up a new activity. This enables entrepreneurs to benefit from a second chance, as they will be fully discharged of their debt after a maximum period of 3 years. Entrepreneurs disqualified on grounds linked to their over-indebtedness should have the benefit of short disqualification orders to offer them an effective second chance, but Member States have a large margin of discretion 3) Measures to increase the efficiency of the procedures relating to these points as well as of insolvency procedures. This will reduce the excessive length and costs of procedures in many Member States, which results in legal uncertainty for creditors and investors and low recovery rates of unpaid debts. Lastly, training, specialisation of practitioners and courts, and the use of technology (e.g. online filing of claims, notifications to creditors) will improve the efficiency and length of insolvency, restructuring and second chance procedures. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the development of digital technologies and internet has transformed the distribution of and access to television and radio programmes, with 49% of European internet users (Eurostat estimate) accessing music, audiovisual content and games online. Broadcasters and retransmission service providers are increasingly investing in the development of digital and online services for the distribution of radio and television programmes. However, despite the growing variety of online services, broadcasters‚Äô programmes often remain unavailable online to European citizens living in other Member States. In addition, the variety of TV and radio channels from other Member States provided by retransmission services differs across the EU. Broadcasting organisations transmit on a daily basis a high number of programmes that they license from others or produce themselves. These programmes incorporate a variety of protected content such as audiovisual, musical, literary or graphic works. This requires a complex clearance of rights with a multitude of right holders. Operators of retransmission services, which aggregate a high number of TV and radio channels into packages, also face difficulties for acquiring all the rights necessary to retransmit the television and radio programmes of broadcasting organisations. The Satellite and Cable Directive does not extend to retransmission services provided by means other than cable over closed electronic communication networks, such as IPTV (TV/radio over closed circuit IP-based networks). This proposal responds to one of the key objectives identified in the Digital Single Market Strategy: to enhance wider online access to TV and radio programmes by users across the EU. It is presented in parallel with: a proposal for a directive to modernise certain aspects of the Union copyright framework to take account of technological developments; and a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two sets of policy options, aimed at facilitating the clearance of rights (i) for the online transmissions of TV and radio programmes; and (ii) for digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes: as regards online transmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application to broadcasters' online services which are ancillary to the initial broadcasts (notably simulcasting and catch-up services); as regards digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application of mandatory collective management of rights to IPTV retransmission services and other retransmission services provided over ""closed"" electronic communications networks, CONTENT: the draft regulation aims to promote the cross-border provision of online services ancillary to broadcasts and to facilitate digital retransmissions over closed networks of TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States by adapting the Union legal framework. The proposal defines the services covered by the measures (notably ""ancillary online services"" and ""retransmission"" services). These definitions will be applied in a uniform manner in the Union. The proposal concerns the facilitation of the clearance of rights for ancillary online services by broadcasting organisations by introducing a principle of country of origin, according to which the copyright relevant act takes place solely in the Member State where the broadcasting organisation is established. It also facilitates the clearance of rights for retransmission services provided over closed networks (other than cable), by introducing rules on mandatory collective management. By addressing the difficulties related to the clearance of rights, the proposal will promote consumers' access to more TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States, both as concerns ancillary online services of broadcasting organisations and retransmission services. The proposal provides that the Commission shall carry out a review of the Regulation and present a report on its main findings. It obliges Member States to provide the Commission with necessary information for the preparation of that report."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed in their inter-institutional agreement on better law making that Community law should be updated and condensed by repealing acts which are no longer applied. Improve transparency and certainty of Union law is the main aim of this Agreement. The Commission has carried out several exercises to remove obsolete legislation from the acquis, partly through the traditional repeal procedure, partly by declaring the relevant Commission acts obsolete. The Commission identified two Council acts related to the Common Agricultural Policy, which are based upon Article 42 and 43 of the Treaty (former Articles 36 and 37), which have exhausted all practical effects, but are formally still in force.

The content of that Directive has been taken up by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/20063; Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 . The temporary scheme established by that Regulation was applicable only until the marketing year 2009/2010."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: tourism plays a central role in Europe‚Äôs economy today. The travel market has evolved since the adoption of Directive 90/314/EEC. The Internet has become an increasingly important medium to offer travel services. Travel services are not only combined in the form of traditional pre-arranged packages, but are often combined in a customised fashion. Many of these travel products are either in a legal grey zone or are clearly not covered by Directive 90/314/EEC. It is therefore necessary to adapt the legislative framework to market developments, remove ambiguities and close legislative gaps. The modernisation of Directive 90/314/EEC responds to requests from the co-legislators and a large part of the industry and consumer organisations. A revision of the Directive is explicitly mentioned in the European Citizens' Report, the European Consumer Agenda and in the Single Market Act II. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment (IA) analysed eight policy options plus certain sub-options, including maintaining the status quo, the drawing up of guidelines, the introduction of a package travel ‚Äúlabel‚Äù, self-regulation by the industry, various options to modernise the Directive, as well as the adoption of a ‚ÄúTravel Directive‚Äù. The chosen option is that of a graduated approach involving the modernisation of the Directive and the coverage of both one trader and multi-trader packages, while applying a lighter regime to ‚Äúmulti-trader‚Äù assisted travel arrangements. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Directive seeks to clarify and modernise the scope of travellers' protection when purchasing combinations of travel services for the same trip or holiday by bringing within its scope different forms of on-line packages and assisted travel arrangements. The proposal will ensure that travellers are better informed about the services they are buying and grant them clearer remedies if something goes wrong. Package travel: the proposal: ¬∑ lists specific pre-contractual information which organisers and, where applicable, retailers have to provide to travellers wishing to buy a package; ¬∑ contains provisions on the content and the presentation of the contract or its confirmation, as well as on documents and information to be provided before the start of the package; ¬∑ regulates the possibility and the consequence of price changes; ¬∑ contains additional termination rights for travellers before the start of the package and grants travellers the right to terminate the contract without compensation in the event of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances; ¬∑ regulates the organiser's liability for the performance of the package and the obligation to provide assistance to the traveller; only the organiser is liable for the performance of the package; retailers involved in the booking of packages and assisted travel arrangements are liable for booking errors; ¬∑ provides for the remedies available to the traveller in the event of the lack of performance and the improper performance of the services; ¬∑ lays down the obligations to remedy the lack of conformity and to make suitable alternative arrangements for the continuation of the package where a significant proportion of the services cannot be provided as agreed in the contract. Where it is impossible to ensure the traveller's timely return because of unavoidable and extraordinary circumstances, the organiser's obligation to bear the cost for the continued stay is limited to EUR 100 per night and three nights per traveller; ¬∑ provides that only package organisers and retailers who facilitate the purchase of 'assisted travel arrangements' are subject to theobligation to provide insolvency protection; ¬∑ provides that travellers may address messages, complaints or claims also to the retailer. Assisted travel arrangement: these are defined as a combination of at least two different types of travel services for the purpose of the same trip or holiday, not constituting a package, resulting in the conclusion of separate contracts with the individual travel service providers. Retailers offering assisted travel arrangements would have to explain to travellers in a clear and prominent manner that only the relevant service providers are liable for performance of the services and that travellers will not benefit from any of the Union rights granted to package travellers, except the right to a refund of pre-payments and, where relevant, to repatriation in case the retailer itself or any of the service providers becomes insolvent. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only operational costs relate to the preparation of the report on the application of this Directive, covering the preparatory work of an external contractor, i.e. operational appropriation of EUR 0.2 million under the Rights and Citizenship programme, as well as administrative expenditure of around EUR 0.184 million during seven years after the adoption of the Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: mercury is recognised as a global threat to human health and the environment. Mercury is characterised by its transboundary nature. Global action is therefore necessary to ensure the protection of the individuals and of the environment within the Union as a complement to domestic measures. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to control and limit the use and anthropogenic emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land. The Convention was adopted and opened for signature at a Conference of the Plenipotentiaries in Kumamoto, Japan, in October 2013. The European Union and twenty-one Member States signed the Convention on 10 October 2013 while Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia and Poland did so on 24 September 2014 and Malta on 8 October 2014. The EU has made significant progress for the last 10 years in addressing mercury domestically as a follow-up to the adoption in 2005 of the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury, as supported by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament in its resolution dated 14.3. 2006. The Strategy was reviewed in 2010 and was supported by the Council of the European Union. The Seventh Environmental Action programme established the long-term objective of a non-toxic environment and stated, for that purpose, that action is needed to ensure the minimisation of significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020. CONTENT: with the present draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The Convention addresses the whole life-cycle of mercury with the objective to protect human health and the environment. It: In parallel to this proposed Decision, the Commission has put forward a proposal for a Regulation by the European Parliament and the Council to transpose the limited number of provisions of the Convention that are not yet implemented into EU legislation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the ideals, principles and values embedded in the European cultural heritage constitute a shared source of remembrance, understanding, identity, dialogue, cohesion and creativity for Europe. Since the adoption of the European Agenda for Culture in 2007, cultural heritage has been a priority under successive Council Work Plans for Culture, including the current plan for the period 2015-2018. The Council, in its conclusions on participatory governance of cultural heritage of 25 November 2014, invited the Commission to consider presenting a proposal for a ‚ÄòEuropean Year of Cultural Heritage‚Äô. The European Parliament, in its resolution recommended designating, preferably for 2018, a European Year of Cultural Heritage.24 The heritage sector in Europe is facing many challenges. These include: decreasing public budgets; declining participation in traditional cultural activities; increasing environmental and physical pressures on heritage sites; transforming value chains and expectations as a result of the digital shift; and the illegal trafficking of cultural artefacts. Against this backdrop, the main objective is to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities and highlight the role of the EU in promoting shared solutions. CONTENT: it is proposed to designate the year 2018 as the ‚ÄòEuropean Year of Cultural Heritage‚Äô. Objectives : the European Year shall: contribute to promoting the role of European cultural heritage as a pivotal component of cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue. It should highlight the best means to ensure its conservation and safeguarding and its enjoyment by a wider and more diversified public. This includes through audience development measures and heritage education, in full respect of the competences of the Member States, thereby promoting social inclusion and integration; enhance the contribution of European cultural heritage to the economy and the society, through its direct and indirect economic potential. This includes the capacity to underpin the cultural and creative industries and inspire creation and innovation, promote sustainable tourism, enhance social cohesion and generate long-term employment; contribute to promoting cultural heritage as an important element of the EU‚Äôs international dimension, building on the interest in partner countries for Europe‚Äôs heritage and expertise. Heritage plays a major role in several programmes in the area of external relations, mainly ‚Äî but not exclusively ‚Äî in the Middle East. The promotion of the value of cultural heritage is also a response to the deliberate destruction of cultural treasures in conflict zone. Specific objectives are also laid down. Measures : the proposal presents measures which will include information and promotion campaigns, events and initiatives at European, national, regional and local levels: conferences, events and initiatives to promote debate and raise awareness of the importance and value of cultural heritage and to facilitate engagement with citizens and stakeholders; information, education and awareness-raising campaigns to convey values such as diversity and intercultural dialogue using evidence from Europe‚Äôs rich heritage and to stimulate the general public‚Äôs contribution in heritage protection and management and more generally in achieving the objectives of the European Year; sharing of experience and good practices of national, regional and local administrations, and other organisations, to disseminate information about cultural heritage; undertaking studies and research and innovation activities and the dissemination of their results on European or national scale. Coordination at national level : each Member State shall appoint a national coordinator responsible for organising its participation in the European Year. The coordinator shall ensure the coordination of relevant activities at national level. Coordination at Union level : the Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators in order to coordinate the running of the European Year and to exchange information regarding its implementation at national and European level. International cooperation : the Commission shall cooperate with competent international organisations, in particular with UNESCO and the Council of Europe, while ensuring the visibility of the EU‚Äôs participation. Funding : co-financing at European level of activities in support of the European Year shall be in accordance with the applicable rules, and within the existing possibilities for priority setting on an annual or multiannual basis, to existing programmes, in particular the Creative Europe programme. Where appropriate, other programmes and policies, within their existing legal and financial provisions, may also support the European Year. Monitoring and evaluation : by 31 December 2019, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, the Council on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in this Decision. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: no additional funding is sought for the European Year. This initiative does not require additional EU budget. The flexibility for setting priorities on an annual or multiannual basis in the relevant programmes is sufficient to envisage an awareness-raising campaign on a scale similar to previous European Years."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the European Parliament and the Council established a Community Programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing. This programme was extended with the Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 of the European Parliament and the Council (""Financing Regulation""). The beneficiaries of the extended programme are the International Financial Reporting Standards Foundation (IFRS Foundation), the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) and the Public Interest Oversight Board (PIOB). EFRAG was established in 2001 as a private organisation to provide the Commission with technical expertise in financial reporting matters. On the basis of Regulation (EU) No 258/2014, the IFRS Foundation and the PIOB benefit from Union co-financing in the form of operating grants until 31 December 2020. In view of the uncertainties related to a major governance reform the organisation was undergoing in 2014, the co-legislators decided to limit its financing period until the end of 2016 and called on the Commission to submit a legislative proposal, if appropriate, to continue financing of EFRAG after 31 December 2016. On 12 November 2013, the Commission published the report of Philippe Maystadt, special advisor to the Commissioner responsible for internal market and services, in which he outlined potential reforms to EFRAG governance aimed at reinforcing the Union's contribution to the development of international accounting standards. The Commission closely monitored the implementation of the reform of EFRAG governance and found that it successfully implemented the conclusions of the special advisor‚Äôs report, by implementing a new governance structure which has increased the legitimacy and representativeness of EFRAG. As a result, EFRAG is now well equipped to strengthen the legitimacy of its positions and significantly contribute to the objective of Europe speaking with one voice. Therefore, it is appropriate to propose to continue financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 in order to meet the long-term objectives of the Union programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 258/2014 in order to increase the budget of the Union Programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing for the period of 2014-2020 and to support the activities of EFRAG, which contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union in relation to financial reporting. In line with the Financing Regulation, EFRAG was allocated an amount of EUR 9 303 000 for the period 2014-2016. The current regulation proposes to allocate to EFRAG an additional amount of EUR 13 831 000 for the period 2017-2020. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed regulation prolongation of the financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 will increase the total budget of the programme to support specific activities in the field of financial reporting and auditing from EUR 43.176 million to approximately EUR 57 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2007, the confidence of financial services' end-users', and in particular that of consumers in the field of financial services, was shaken by the financial and economic crisis. Therefore, the European legislators considered that the concerns of consumers and other financial services end-users should be systematically and adequately taken into account (retail investors, savers, insurance holders, pension fund participants and borrowers) to restore citizens' confidence in the soundness of the financial sector. Several actions have been undertaken by the European Commission to ensure that the views of consumers and other end-users of financial services are heard, notably with (i) the establishment in 2010 of the Financial Services Users Group (FSUG) which acts as a forum where non-industry stakeholders‚Äô representatives are regularly kept informed about the financial services policy issues under development and are invited to give their views and express their concerns and suggestions on intended legislative initiatives and (ii) the systematic inclusion of consumers and civil society organisations‚Äô representatives in the various expert groups set up to assist the Commission or the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) in their work in the financial services area. At the end of 2011, the Commission launched a pilot project aiming to provide grants to support the development of a financial expertise centre to the benefit of end-users and non-industry stakeholders and enhance their capacity to participate in Union policy making in the field of financial services. It awarded operating grants to two non-profit organisations based in Brussels, Finance Watch and Better Finance between 2012 and 2015. These grants were awarded under a pilot project during two years, 2012 and 2013, and a preparatory action since 2014. The evaluation of the pilot project and the subsequent preparatory action carried out in 2015 concluded that the policy objectives have been generally achieved. However, despite regular efforts, both organisations did not manage to attract stable and significant funding from other donors, independent from the financial industry, and, therefore, remain heavily dependent on Union funding. Since 2012, both beneficiaries have been funded up to 60% of their eligible costs through Union grants and they remain heavily dependent on Union funding. Co-funding these beneficiaries along the same line as of 2017 is the only option which can ensure that all the results and effects that have materialised since 2012 according to the evaluation results are likely to continue. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to establish a Union programme for the period from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020 to support the activities of the organisations Finance Watch and Better Finance who contribute to the achievement of the policy objectives of the Union in relation to enhancing the involvement of consumers and other financial services end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their interests in Union policy making in the field of financial services. The Programme shall cover the following activities : research activities, including production of own research, data, expertise; awareness and dissemination activities, including to a wide audience of non-experts; activities reinforcing the interactions between the members of the beneficiary organisations and advocacy activities fostering the positions of those members at Union level. The Programme shall have the following objectives : to further enhance the participation of consumers and other financial services end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their interests, in Union policymaking in the area of financial services; to contribute to the information of consumers and other financial services end-users, as well as stakeholders representing their interests, about issues at stake in the regulation of the financial sector. These objectives shall be monitored in particular through a yearly description of the actions performed by the beneficiaries of the Programme and an annual activity report, which shall include quantitative and qualitative indicators for each activity planned and conducted by the beneficiaries. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on expenditure (operational appropriations) is estimated at EUR 6 000 000 for the period from 2017-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the common and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds. The general budget of the Union for the financial year 2019 amended the total amount of resources for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI in 2019 by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices and bringing the total amount of commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI for the entire programming period to EUR 4 527 882 072 in current prices. For 2019, the additional resources of EUR 99 573 877 in 2011 prices are funded by the Global Margin for Commitments within the margin of the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020. It is appropriate to provide for specific measures facilitating the implementation of the YEI, due to the advanced stage of the implementation of operational programmes for the 2014-2020 programming period. CONTENT: the proposal aims to adapt the amounts of resources available for economic, social and territorial cohesion, the amount of resources for the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations reflected in Annex VI of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to reflect the increase of the resources of the YEI, in line with the adopted budget for 2019. More specifically, commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI should be increased by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices, bringing the overall amount for 2019 up to EUR 350 million. The proposal also introduces provisions to respond to the co-legislators' request for facilitating measures to ensure the swift programming of the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2019, so as not to hamper the overall implementation progress of the 2014-2020 operational programmes. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposed amendment should not result in additional payment appropriations needs in 2019. For 2020 the budgetary implication should be limited only to additional payment appropriations to cover the annual pre-financing due on the increased YEI resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the challenges that need to be tackled by external action have increased in recent years: regional conflicts, terrorism, economic inequalities and growing migratory pressures, demographic growth and environmental degradation. At the same time, while poverty levels have declined globally, the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem, including in emerging economies. For the next long-term EU budget for the period 2021-2027, the European Commission proposes to increase investment in external actions, to restructure the Union's external action instruments and to integrate the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget in order to ensure greater coherence, to benefit from effective cooperation, to simplify procedures and to achieve economies of scale. The proposed neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument (NDICI) is designed to uphold and promote the Union‚Äôs values and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of its external action. It shall be the EU's main instrument for assisting its partners in their political and economic change towards sustainable development, stability, consolidation of democracy, socio-economic development and poverty eradication. The proposal provides a framework for the implementation of external action policies and international obligations that include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and UN Security Council Resolution 2282 (2016) on sustaining peace. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument programme for the period 2021-2027. It also establishes the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (the EFSD+) and an external action guarantee. The neighbourhood and international cooperation instrument shall be based on three pillars: a geographical pillar to cover planned cooperation with neighbouring countries and all other third countries.

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a central counterparty (CCP) acts as the intermediary to both sides of a transaction in a financial instrument, including bonds, equities, derivatives and commodities (such as agricultural products, oil and natural gas). The importance of CCPs has nearly doubled since the post-crisis G20 commitment to clear standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through CCPs. This obligation is implemented in the EU by the Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (‚ÄòEMIR‚Äô). That Regulation also sets out comprehensive prudential requirements for CCPs, as well as requirements regarding the operations and oversight of CCPs. However, no harmonised EU rules exist for the unlikely situations in which CCPs would face severe distress ‚Äì beyond that envisaged by EMIR ‚Äì or outright failure. Recovery and resolution measures are required in order to safeguard financial stability, ensure the continuity of critical functions and protect taxpayers. The tools currently available to Member State authorities are inadequate to deal with CCPs that face significant stress. In December 2013 the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to propose appropriate EU measures to ensure that the impacts of a potential failure of key financial institutions, most notably CCPs, could be mitigated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this concluded that EU action is necessary given the cross-border nature of CCPs' business, which links multiple financial actors, counterparties and clients throughout the single market. CONTENT: the draft regulation lays down rules and procedures relating to the recovery and resolution of CCPs authorised in accordance with EMIR Regulation. It also lays down rules relating to the arrangements with third countries in the field of recovery and resolution of CCPs. It sets out provisions comparable to those in the EMIR framework applicable to banks and investment firms to facilitate orderly recovery and resolution but adapts them to the specific features of CCPs. Objectives : these are: first, to seek the orderly recovery of CCPs in various scenarios of financial distress through the implementation of recovery plans that are agreed between the CCP and its clearing members; if this were to be insufficient, authorities should take swift action in order to safeguard financial stability. Set-up of resolution authorities and resolution colleges : resolution authorities for CCPs shall be set up and equipped with a harmonised set of powers to undertake all the relevant preparatory and resolution actions. Furthermore, CCPs‚Äô resolution authorities are required to set up resolution colleges for each CCP containing all the relevant authorities including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European banking Authority (EBA). Preparation ‚Äì recovery plans : CCPs are required to prepare recovery plans to overcome any form of financial distress which would exceed their default management resources and other requirements under EMIR. Preparation ‚Äì resolution plans and resolvability assessments : resolution authorities are required to prepare resolution plans for how CCPs would be restructured and their critical functions kept alive in the event of their failure. The plans should outline the resolution powers and tools which authorities would employ in case a CCP meets the conditions for resolution. Early intervention : this will ensure that financial difficulties are addressed as soon as they arise and problems can be averted. Competent authorities are granted specific powers to intervene in the operations of CCPs where their viability is at risk but before they reach the point of failure. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: crowdfunding has emerged as an established practice of funding a project or a venture, typically by a large number of people or organisations, through online platforms on which citizens, organisations and businesses, including business start-ups, raise relatively small amounts of money. Crowdfunding can thus provide an alternative to unsecured bank lending, which are currently the main sources of external finance for SMEs. The provision of crowdfunding services generally relies on three types of actors: the project owner that proposes the project to be funded, investors who fund the proposed project, generally by limited investments, and an intermediating organisation in the form of a service provider that brings together project owners and investors through an online platform. Several Member States have already introduced domestic bespoke regimes on crowdfunding. Those regimes are tailored to the characteristics and needs of local markets and investors. As a result, the national rules diverge as regards the conditions of operation of crowdfunding platforms, the scope of permitted activities and the licencing requirements. The differences between the existing national rules are such as to obstruct the cross border provision of crowdfunding services. It is therefore necessary to address the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market in crowdfunding services. This initiative is part of the Commission's priority of establishing a Capital Market Union (CMU), which aims to broaden access to finance for innovative companies, start-ups and other unlisted firms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that EU crowdfunding markets for business finance are largely underdeveloped compared to other major economies but - and most importantly - unable to properly operate cross-border. Amongst the options studied, the preferred option consists of introducing an EU-label for crowdfunding service providers, which would be authorised and supervised at EU level under an EU regime. CONTENT: the Commission‚Äôs proposal introduces an optional EU scheme that allows crowdfunding platforms to easily deliver their services across the EU single market. It establishes a one-stop-shop access to the EU market and therefore helps crowdfunding platforms in overcoming the barriers they face operating cross-border. The proposal does not intend to interfere with national bespoke regimes or existing licenses, including those under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), but rather to provide crowdfunding service providers with the possibility to apply for an EU label that empowers them to scale up their operations throughout the Union under certain conditions. Scope : the proposal applies to crowdfunding services involving financial remuneration for investors. Donation and reward-based crowdfunding are excluded from the scope of this initiative, as they cannot be considered financial services. The proposal does not include in its scope consumers lending for consumption purposes. Effective and prudent management : crowdfunding service providers must at all times comply with the organisational requirements, while natural persons having the power to manage a crowdfunding service provider should have appropriate skills and professional experience. A crowdfunding service provider must maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps designed to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests of its clients. Authorisation and monitoring : the proposal provides uniform, proportionate and directly applicable requirements for authorisation and a single point of supervision. Crowdfunding service providers will provide their services under the supervision of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Investor protection and transparency : the proposal also aims to provide investors with the necessary information on crowdfunding, including the underlying risks. Accordingly, all information, including marketing communications, from crowdfunding service providers to clients must be complete, clear and correct. The proposal sets out an initial assessment of the appropriateness of a potential client and provides that platforms shall offer investors the possibility to simulate their ability to bear losses. The proposed regulation also provides for adequate safeguards to minimize the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the preferred option holds implications in terms of costs and administrative burden for ESMA. Assuming that ESMA will be in charge of authorising and supervising 25 providers in the first full year of implementation (2020), there will be a cost impact (net of fees charged on the industry) of approximately EUR 1 637 000 in that year. This estimate also includes half of EUR 500 000 in one-off costs to be split over the first two years, used to setup the necessary IT systems. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the conditions for making fertilisers available on the internal market have been partially harmonised through Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Virtually all product-types currently included in the existing Fertilisers Regulation are conventional, inorganic fertilisers, typically extracted from mines or chemically produced in line with a linear economy model. These processes are both energy consuming and CO2-intensive. Around 50 % of the fertilisers currently on the market are left out of the scope of the Regulation. This is true for a few inorganic fertilisers and for virtually all fertilisers produced from organic materials, such as animal or other agricultural by products, or recycled bio-waste from the food chain. As a result, fertilisers sourced in line with the circular economy remain non-harmonised. Their access to the single market is therefore dependent on mutual recognition between Member States, which is often difficult due to diverging national rules. Furthermore, the existing Fertilisers Regulation fails to address environmental concerns arising from contamination by EC-fertilisers of soil, inland waters, seawaters, and ultimately food. The ex-post evaluation of the existing Fertilisers Regulation conducted in 2010 concluded that the Regulation could be more effective in promoting innovative fertilisers, and that adjustments would also be needed to better protect the environment. The Commission proposes to establish harmonised conditions for making fertilisers made from recycled or organic materials available on the entire internal market in order to provide an important incentive for their further use. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment compared status quo (referred to as option 1) with four other policy options. Under the four options, the scope of harmonisation would be extended to fertilisers from organic raw materials and to other fertiliser-related products, and limit values would be introduced for contaminants. The final proposal corresponds with the option that would build on the 'New Legislative Framework' ('NLF'), with one conformity assessment procedure varying between material categories. This was considered to be the best policy choice because it would lead to administrative simplification, in particular for fertilising products from well identified, primary raw materials, and ensure flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the use of harmonised fertilising products does not pose unacceptable risks to health or the environment. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal the existing Fertilisers Regulation and to address the problems identified in the evaluation conducted in 2010. It has also been identified as one of the key legislative proposals under the circular economy action plan. The main policy objective of the initiative is to incentivise large-scale fertiliser production in the EU from domestic organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, by transforming waste into nutrients for crops. The draft regulation provides a regulatory framework radically easing access to the internal market for such fertilisers, thereby levelling their playing field with that of mined or chemical fertilisers produced in line with a linear economy model. This would contribute to the following circular economy objectives by: allowing valorisation of secondary raw materials, hence enabling improved use of raw materials and turning eutrophication and waste management problems into economic opportunities for public and private operators; increasing resource efficiency and decrease import dependency for raw materials essential to European agriculture, in particular phosphorus; boosting investment and innovation in the circular economy, hence creating jobs in the EU; contributing to relieving the fertilisers industry from its current pressure to reduce CO2-emissions under ETS, by allowing it to produce fertilisers from less carbon-intensive feedstock. A second policy objective is to address the issue of soil and food contamination and introduce harmonised cadmium limits for phosphate fertilisers . The Regulation introduces strict limits for cadmium in phosphate fertilisers. The limits will be tightened from 60 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg after three years and to 20 mg/kg after 12 years, reducing health and environmental risks. To achieve these objectives , the proposal: sets out the subject matter, scope and definitions, as well as the fundamental principles of free movement and marketability of CE marked fertilising products. The provision on product requirements are contained in the Annexes, which include the substantive requirements for the categories of end products in accordance with their intended function (Annex I), as well as for the categories of component materials that can be contained in CE marked fertilising products (Annex II). Annex III specifies the labelling requirements; lays down the obligations of economic operators involved in making CE marked fertilising products available on the market; sets out the general principle for conformity of CE marked fertilising products. It refers to Annex IV, which describes in detail the conformity assessment procedures applicable to CE marked fertilising products, depending on their component material categories and their product function categories. It also refers to Annex V, which sets out the model structure for the EU declaration of conformity. sets out the provisions on notified bodies, and on market surveillance. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: reducing the negative impact of transport activities remains one of the main goals of the Union's transport policy. With the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in force, the transition to a modern and low-carbon economy will need to accelerate. Council Directive 92/106/EEC which establishes measures to encourage the development of combined transport, is the only legislative act of the Union to directly incentivise the shift from road freight to lower emission transport modes such as inland waterways, maritime and rail. However, since the Directive was adopted in 1992, some of these conditions, e.g. the use of paper transport documents and stamps as proof of eligibility for combined transport and the freight market environment have undergone considerable changes. While the Directive has helped shift a considerable amount of freight away from road, shortcomings in the implementation of that Directive and the limited scope of its support measures, have significantly reduced its impact. According to estimations, the goal of reaching 30% of road freight over 300 km shifted to other modes of transport such as rail or waterborne transport by 2030, and more than 50% by 2050, in order to optimise the performance of multimodal logistic chains, including by making greater use of more energy-efficient modes, has been slower than expected and according to the current projections, will not be reached. In order to improve the competitiveness of combined transport compared to long-distance road freight, thereby strengthening the shift to other modes for the transport of goods, the Commission considers that a revision of the Directive is necessary in order to: (i) clarifying and extending the definition of combined transport; (ii) improving the monitoring of eligibility and enforcement conditions; (iii) increasing the effectiveness of incentives; and (iv) improving the reporting and monitoring conditions of the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the strategic option chosen aims to simplify the eligibility criteria, better define the enforcement conditions and broaden the economic support measures. CONTENT: this initiative aims to support multimodality and strengthen the shift from road freight by addressing the shortcomings of the existing legislation (Directive 92/106/EEC) and in particular by extending its scope using a broader set of possible support measures. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to: review the definition of ‚Äòcombined transport‚Äô by extending its scope to national services and by further specifying the maximum distance of the road leg as 150 km or 20 % of the total distance, irrespective of the non-road leg type (rail, inland waterways or maritime), while ensuring that flexibility is allowed due to specific geographical or operational constraints in Member States; extend the economic support measures put in place by the Member States, i.e. investment support and operational support (e.g. vehicle tax breaks) and additional support measures that Member States may adopt to complement existing ones in order to reduce the cost of a combined transport operation and to make it more competitive compared to the equivalent road-only operation; specifies which documents an operator must provide to demonstrate the existence of combined transport and receive assistance from the State. Thus, the proposal: (i) defines the condition for road transport to be considered as part of a combined transport operation; (ii) lists and details the data to be provided as evidence; (iii) states that no additional document shall be required to prove the combined transport operation; (iv) provides the conditions of presentation of the evidence, including for the purposes of a roadside check. The Commission proposes to use documents in electronic format more efficiently; introduces the obligation for Member States to report to the Commission, 18 months after the date for transposition of the Directive, data on the conditions of the combined transport market in their territory, including on the relevant infrastructure and the adopted national support measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: securitisation involves transactions that enable a lender ‚Äì typically a credit institution ‚Äì to refinance a set of loans or exposures such as loans for immovable property, auto leases, consumer loans or credit cards, by transforming them into tradable securities. Securitisation can be an important channel for diversifying funding sources and allocating risk more efficiently within the EU financial system. Overall, it can improve efficiencies in the financial system and provide additional investment opportunities. Securitisation can create a bridge between credit institutions and capital markets with an indirect benefit for businesses and citizens (through, for example, less expensive loans and business finance mortgages and credit cards). In the Investment Plan for Europe presented on 26 November 2014, the Commission announced its intention to restart high quality securitisation markets, without repeating the mistakes made before the 2008 financial crisis. The Commission considers that the development of a simple, transparent and standardised securitisation market constitutes a building block of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) and contributes to the Commission's priority objective to support job creation and a return to sustainable growth. In its resolution of July 2015 on the Capital Markets Union , the European Parliament noted that the development of simple, transparent and standardised securitisation should be exploited better and welcomed the initiative to establish a sustainable, transparent securitisation market by developing a specific regulatory framework with a uniform definition of high-quality securitisation, combined with effective methods for monitoring, measuring and managing risk. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the effects of the initiative are likely to change through time. The Commission considers that if the securitisation market would return to pre-crisis average issuance levels, credit institutions could provide an additional amount of credit to the private sector ranging between ‚Ç¨100-150bn. This would represent a 1.6% increase in credit to EU firms and households. The policy options taken in this proposal should have several positive effects on SME financing. CONTENT: this proposal is based on what has been put in place in the EU to address the risks inherent in highly complex, opaque and risky securitisation. It should help to better differentiate simple, transparent and standardised (STS) products which can provide a channel of sustainable finance to the EU economy from more opaque and complex products. This framework should provide confidence to investors and a high standard for the EU, to help parties evaluate the risks relating to securitisation (both within and across products). The proposal forms a legislative package with the legislative proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms. restart markets on a more sustainable basis, so that simple, transparent and standardised securitisation can act as an effective funding channel to the economy; allow for efficient and effective risk transfers to a broad set of institutional investors as well as banks; allow securitisation to function as an effective funding mechanism for some longer term investors as well as banks; protect investors and manage systemic risk by avoiding a recurrence of the flawed ""originate to distribute"" models. Essentially, this proposal contains two main parts. The first part is devoted to rules that apply to all securitisation, whilst the second part focuses only on STS Securitisation. Due diligence rules for investors : since securitisations are not always the simplest and most transparent financial products and can involve higher risks than other financial instruments, institutional investors are subject to due diligence rules. The proposal also requires investors to perform appropriate due diligence before investing in STS securitisations. They also remain responsible for assessing risks inherent to their exposure to the securitisation position and whether the securitisation is suitable and appropriate for the needs of the investor. Risk retention : the proposal imposes a direct risk retention requirement and a reporting obligation on the originator, sponsor or the original lenders. Investors will thus in a simple manner be able to check whether these entities have retained risk. Transparency rules : the proposal ensures that investors will have all the relevant information on securitisations at their disposal. It covers all types of securitisations and applies across sectors. It requires originators, sponsors and Securitisation Special Purpose Entities (SSPEs) to make freely available the information to investors, via standardised templates, on a website that meets certain criteria such as control of data quality and business continuity. STS securitisations : there will be two types of STS requirements: one for long-term securitisations and one for short-term securitisations (ABCP). To a large extent the requirements are however similar. This proposal only allows 'true sale' securitisation to become STS. The Commission will assess whether some synthetic securitisations that have performed well during the financial crisis and that are simple, transparent and standardised should be able to meet the STS requirements. STS notification and disclosure : originators, sponsors and SSPEs take responsibility for their claim that the securitisation is STS and that there is transparency on the market. Originators and sponsors shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from incorrect or misleading notifications under the conditions stipulated by national law. Surveillance : the proposal requires Member States to designate competent authorities in accordance with existing EU legal acts in the area of financial services to ensure effective surveillance of the securitisation market. : this BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this legislative proposal would have limited consequences on the EU budget (EUR 1,733 millions). It will imply further policy development within the Commission and in the three ESAs (EBA, ESMA and EIOPA). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains measures empowering the Commission to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. CONTEXT: securitisations are an important constituent part of well-functioning financial markets. The Commission considers that promoting the development of a securitisation market based on sound practices will contribute to a return to sustainable growth and job creation. Furthermore, a common, high quality EU securitisation framework will promote further integration of financial markets in the Union, help diversify funding sources and unlock capital, making it easier for credit institutions to lend to households and businesses. In order to attain this objective, two steps must be taken: 1) to develop a common substantive framework for securitisations for all participants in this market and identify a subset of transactions meeting certain eligibility criteria: simple, transparent and standardised (STS) securitisations or STS securitisations. This is the subject of the Commission Proposal for a Securitisation Regulation . 2) to make amendments to the regulatory framework of securitisations in EU law, including in the area of capital charges for credit institutions and investment firms originating, sponsoring or investing in these instruments, to provide for a more risk-sensitive regulatory treatment for STS securitisations. The global financial crisis revealed a number of shortcomings in the current securitisation framework. In order to address these shortcomings and contribute to enhancing the resilience of institutions to market shocks, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) adopted in December 2014 a recommendation for a revised securitisation framework (""the Revised Basel Framework""). The measure has been designed to reduce the complexity of the current regulatory capital requirements, reflect better the risks of positions in a securitisation and allow the use of the information available to institution to allocate capital requirements based on their own calculations, thus reducing reliance on external ratings. At an European level, the European Banking Authority (EBA) issued a report on qualifying securitisations on 7 July 2015 which recommended lowering capital charges for STS securitisations to a prudent level relative to those set out in the Revised Basel Framework and to amend the regulatory capital requirements for securitisations set out in the Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) in line with the Revised Basel Framework. For STS securitisations, the EBA re-calibrated downwards the 3 approaches developed by the BCBS for the Revised Basel Framework. The Commission now proposes to amend the regulatory capital requirements for securitisations in the CRR in order to: implement the regulatory capital calculation approaches set out in the Revised Basel Framework; introduce a re-calibration for STS securitisations, consistent with the recommendation of the EBA. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment accompanying the Securitisation Regulation clearly shows the benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness of: introducing a revised regulatory framework on capital charges for exposures to securitisations, and differentiating the treatment of STS securitisations having regard to the overall objectives of the Commission legislative package on securitisation, i) remove stigma attached to securitisations among investors; ii) remove regulatory disadvantages for STS products; and iii) reduce or eliminate unduly high operational costs for issuers and investors. CONTENT: this Regulation forms a legislative package with the proposed Securitisation Regulation which aims to restart securitisation markets on a more sustainable basis and making this a safe and efficient instrument for funding and risk management. The proposed Regulation aims to review the regulatory capital requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR) for institutions originating, sponsoring or investing in securitisations should be amended to reflect adequately the specific features of STS securitisations and address the shortcomings of the framework which became apparent during the financial crisis, namely its mechanistic reliance on external ratings, excessively low risk weights for highly-rated securitisation tranches and, conversely, excessively high risk weights for low-rated tranches, and insufficient risk sensitivity. The amendments to the existing regulatory framework should take account of the regulatory capital calculation approaches set out in the Revised Basel Framework. institutions may calculate capital requirements for their securitisation positions in accordance with a single hierarchy of approaches, which starts with the Internal Ratings Based Approach (IRB Approach) at the top; if an institution cannot use the approach based on internal ratings, it must use a External Ratings-Based Approach (""SEC-ERBA"" Approach), provided the exposure has an external credit assessment which meets a series of operational requirements; in the case where the Institution cannot use the External Ratings Based Approach, either because is located in a jurisdiction that doesn't permit its use or because it lacks the information needed to use that approach, it shall use a Standardised Approach (the ""SEC-SA"" Approach) based on a supervisory-provided formula. No later than 3-years from the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission will review the proposed approach to capital requirements for securitisation exposures, including the hierarchy of approaches, taking into account its impact on securitisation markets developments and the need to preserve financial stability in the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) ensures the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the respect for private life, confidentiality of communications and the protection of personal data in the electronic communications sector. It also guarantees the free movement of electronic communications data, equipment and services in the Union. The Commission carried out an ex post evaluation of the ePrivacy Directive. It follows from the evaluation that the objectives and principles of the current framework remain sound. However, important technological and economic developments took place in the market since the last revision of the ePrivacy Directive in 2009. The Directive has not kept pace with technological developments, resulting in a void of protection of communications conveyed through new services. A Eurobarometer survey on ePrivacy was conducted throughout the EU. The key findings are the following: 78% say it is very important that personal information on their computer, smartphone or tablet can only be accessed with their permission; 72% state that it is very important that the confidentiality of their e-mails and online instant messaging is guaranteed; 89% agree with the suggested option that the default settings of their browser should stop the sharing of their information. This proposal seeks to update the legal framework. It aims at reinforcing trust and security in the Digital Single Market ‚Äì a key objective of the Digital Single Market strategy. The draft Regulation also aligns the rules for electronic communications services with the new world-class standards of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option offers a measured reinforcement of privacy/confidentiality by extending the scope of the legal instrument to include new functionally equivalent electronic communications services and which protects against unsolicited communications and simplifies and clarifies the regulatory environment. CONTENT: this proposed new Regulation seeks to enhance protection of confidentiality of electronic communications by extending the scope of the legal instrument to include new functionally equivalent electronic communications services. Like the European Electronic Communications Code, this proposal also brings the Over-the-Top (OTT) providers in its scope to reflect the market reality. Confidentiality of electronic communications : the proposal: contains the key provisions ensuring the limited permitted purposes and conditions of processing such communications data: privacy will be guaranteed for both content and metadata derived from electronic communications (e.g. time of a call and location). Both have a high privacy component and, under the proposed rules, will need to be anonymised or deleted if users have not given their consent, unless the data is required for instance for billing purposes; addresses the protection of terminal equipment, by (i) guaranteeing the integrity of the information stored in it and (ii) protecting information emitted from terminal equipment, as it may enable the identification of its end-user; details the consent of end-users, where technically possible and feasible, consent may be expressed by using the appropriate technical settings of a software application enabling access to the internet. End-users who have consented to the processing of electronic communications data shall be given the possibility to withdraw their consent at any time and be reminded of this possibility at periodic intervals of 6 months, as long as the processing continue; imposes an obligation on providers of software permitting electronic communications to help end-users in making effective choices about privacy settings. Rights of end-users to control the sending and reception of electronic communications : with a view to protecting their privacy, the new Regulation proposed: the right of end-users to prevent the presentation of the calling line identification to guarantee anonymity; the obligation for providers of publicly available number-based interpersonal communication to provide for the possibility to limit the reception of unwanted calls; the regulation of the conditions under which end-users may be included in publicly available directories and the conditions under which unsolicited communications for direct marketing may be conducted. Supervision and enforcement of this Regulation : this shall be entrusted to the supervisory authorities in charge of the GDPR. The powers of the European Data Protection Board are extended and the cooperation and consistency mechanism foreseen under the GDPR will apply in case of cross-border matters related to this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fitness check of EU consumer and marketing law, which also covers Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests, demonstrated that the risk of infringements of Union law affecting the collective interests of consumers is increasing due to economic globalisation and digitalisation. In view of the increase in cross-border trade, it is increasingly common for such infringements to affect consumers in several Member States. The absence of an EU-wide collective redress mechanism is of particular practical relevance to consumer protection, as shown by concrete cases, including the diesel emissions case. In its resolution of 2 February 2012, the European Parliament stressed the need for a horizontal EU approach to collective redress focusing on breaches of consumer rights, based on a common set of principles respecting national legal traditions and providing safeguards against abusive litigation. In this context, this proposal aims to modernise and replace Directive 2009/22/EC on injunctions. It is presented together with the proposal on targeted amendments to four EU consumer law Directives as part of the ""New Deal for Consumers"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is to tighten the rules on sanctions, to improve the efficiency of the injunction procedure and to add other measures concerning collective redress for consumers. Stronger mechanisms for collective redress would ensure a higher level of consumer protection in mass harm situations and reduce consumer detriment. As concerns efficiency, all options could lead to initial familiarisation costs, but also to savings for compliant traders. CONTENT: the new Directive replacing Directive 2009/22/EC would aim to ensure that ""qualified entities"" - for example consumer organisations ‚Äì may seek representative actions to protect the collective interests of consumers. For example, in a Dieselgate-type scenario, victims of unfair commercial practices, such as misleading advertising by car manufacturers, will be able to obtain remedies collectively through a representative action under this proposal. Such collective redress was previously not provided under Union law. The proposed new Directive: covers all infringements by traders of Union law that harm or may harm the collective interests of consumers in a variety of sectors such as financial services, energy, telecommunications, health and the environment; enables qualified entities to be able to seek measures aimed at eliminating the continuing effects of the infringement. These measures should take the form of a redress order obligating the trader to provide for, inter alia, compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract termination or reimbursement of the price paid, as appropriate and as available under national laws. These qualified entities will have to satisfy minimum reputational criteria (they must be properly established, not for profit and have a legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with the relevant EU law). For compensatory collective redress actions, qualified entities would also be required to disclose to the courts or administrative authorities their financial capacity and the origin of their funds supporting the action and to ensure that there are no conflicts of interests or risks of abuse in a given case; sets out the rules requiring the infringing trader to adequately inform the consumers concerned about the final injunction orders, final decisions on measures eliminating continuing effects of the infringements. This provision ensures consumers' awareness about the breach of law and their redress opportunities; requires Member States to ensure that all representative actions are treated with due diligence and that representative actions seeking an interim injunction order are dealt with under an accelerated procedure, while avoiding that procedural costs become a financial barrier to representative actions; favours collective out-of-court settlements, under the control of the courts or administrative authorities. If a decision finding an infringement has become final, it should be irrefutable evidence in any subsequent redress action in the same Member State; ensures the application of effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanctions in cases where a defendant does not comply with a final decision of a court or administrative authority in a representative action."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation on summer-time arrangements was first introduced in 1980 with the objective of unifying existing national summer-time practices and schedules. Since 2001, EU summer-time arrangements have been governed by Directive 2000/84/EC setting out the obligation on all Member States to switch to summer-time on the last Sunday of March and to switch back to their standard time (""winter-time"") on the last Sunday of October. The system of bi-annual clock changes has been increasingly questioned, by citizens, by the European Parliament, and by a growing number of Member States. In its resolution of 8 February 2018, Parliament asked the Commission to carry out an assessment of summer-time arrangements as provided for in Directive 2000/84/EC and, where appropriate, to submit a proposal for revision. The Commission has also carried out a public consultation, which generated around 4.6 million replies, of which 84% were in favour of discontinuing the bi-annual clock changes while 16% wanted to keep them. Against this background, the Commission considers that the arrangements for summer time should be terminated in a coordinated manner in order to avoid any major disruption to the internal market caused by divergences between Member States in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the evidence available on the effects of the EU summer-time arrangements, the conclusion can be drawn that a continued harmonised regime ‚Äì whereby all Member States abolish the bi-annual time changes ‚Äì would remain beneficial for the functioning of the internal market. Effects on other areas are rather inconclusive and are likely to depend on the geographical location and whether Member States choose to stay with permanent summer- or permanent winter-time. The impact of this choice therefore needs to be assessed at national level. A change of system will also bring about transition costs that should be considered. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to end seasonal changes in European time from 2019 onwards, while leaving the Member States free to decide whether to permanently apply summer time or winter time. Directive 2000/84/EC will be repealed. Member States wishing to return permanently to winter time may make a final change of seasonal time on Sunday 27 October 2019 (at 01.00 in the morning). From this date, seasonal time changes will no longer be possible. Member States remain free to make changes to their standard time that are not linked to seasonal changes. In order to avoid disturbances Member States should inform the Commission of their intention to change their standard time 6 months before changes take effect. Given that the Member States will have to apply Directive as from 1 April 2019, the Directive provides that each Member State must, by 27 April 2019 at the latest, on the basis of possible consultations and assessments at national level and in concertation with other Member States, notify the Commission of its intention to permanently apply a standard time corresponding to their current winter-time, rather than to their current summer-time."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the energy sector plays a key role in the obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the Union by at least 40% until 2030 with an expected share of 50% of renewables by 2030. The European Parliament adopted a resolution in September 2016 stressing that a well-functioning integrated energy market is the best tool to guarantee affordable energy prices, secure energy supplies and to allow for the integration and development of larger volumes of electricity produced from renewable sources in a cost efficient manner. The current electricity market design is based on the rules of the Third Energy Package, adopted in 2009. The latter has brought tangible progress for consumers but new developments have led to fundamental changes in European electricity markets. The share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E) has steeply increased, and this shift will continue as it is a key condition to fulfilling the Union's obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate. In parallel, state interventions, often designed in an uncoordinated manner, have led to distortions of the wholesale electricity market, with negative consequences for investments and cross-border trade. Significant changes are also taking place on the technological side. The shortcomings of the current market arrangements also reduce the attractiveness of the energy sector for new investment. Furthermore, fully integrating industrial, commercial and residential consumers into the energy system can avoid significant costs for 'backup' generation - costs which consumers would otherwise end up paying. Delivering a new deal for energy consumers is a key commitment of the Energy Union. The present electricity market design initiative thus aims to put consumers at the heart of the energy market, and adapt the current market rules to new market realities, by allowing electricity to move freely to where it is most needed when it is most needed via undistorted price signals, whilst empowering consumers, reaping maximum benefits for society from cross-border competition and providing the right signals and incentives to drive the necessary investments to decarbonise our energy system. It will also give priority to energy efficiency solutions, and contribute to the goal of becoming a world leader in energy production from renewable energy sources, thus contributing to the Union's target to create jobs, growth and attract investments. The proposal for a recast of the Regulation on the electricity market, this proposal the recast of the Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity, and the proposal on the recast of the Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators are part of the Commission's broader package of initiatives (""Clean Energy for All""). That Package comprises the Commission's key proposals to implement the Energy Union. The proposal is also closely linked to the proposal for a revised Renewable Energy Directive, providing for a framework to achieve the 2030 renewable target, including principles in relation to support schemes for renewable energy sources. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: all proposed measures are supported by the impact assessment, on which the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion on 7 November 2016. The impact assessment endorsed an enhancement of current market rules in order to create a level-playing field among all generation technologies and resources by removing existing market distortions. retail market , the preferred option included Member States being encouraged to progressively phase-out blanket price regulation, starting with prices below cost. Vulnerable consumers can be protected by a transitional price regulation. CONTENT: the draft Directive contains eight Chapters, the main provisions of which may be summarised as follows: Objectives : the draft directive establishes common rules for the generation, transmission, distribution, storage and supply of electricity, together with consumer protection provisions, with a view to creating truly integrated, consumer-centred and flexible electricity markets in the Union. The Directive aims at ensuring affordable energy prices for consumers, a high degree of security of supply and a smooth transition towards a decarbonised energy system. It lays down key rules relating to the organisation and functioning of the European electricity sector, in particular rules on consumer empowerment and protection, on open access to the integrated market, on third party access to transmission and distribution infrastructure, unbundling rules, and on independent national energy regulators. General rules for the organisation of the sector : the general principle is that Member States have to ensure that the EU electricity market is competitive, consumer-centred, flexible and non-discriminatory. The text emphasises that national measures should not unduly hamper cross-border flows, consumer participation or investments. It further enshrines the principle that supply prices shall be market-based, subject to duly justified exceptions. The Chapter also clarifies certain principles relating to the functioning of the EU electricity markets, such as the right to choose a supplier. It also provides for updated rules on possible public service obligations that may be imposed by Member States on energy undertakings under certain circumstances. Consumer empowerment and protection : this Chapter reinforces pre-existing consumer rights and introduces new rights that aim at putting consumers at the heart of the energy markets by ensuring that they are empowered and better protected. The proposal: contains rules on clearer billing information and on certified comparison tools; sets out provisions ensuring that consumers are able to freely choose and change suppliers or aggregators, are entitled to a dynamic price contract and are able to engage in demand response, self-generation and self-consumption of electricity; entitles every consumer to request a smart meter equipped with a minimum set of functionalities; aims to ensure that energy poverty is addressed by Member States; requires Member States to define frameworks for independent aggregators and for demand response along principles that enable their full participation in the market; defines a framework for local energy communities which may engage in local energy generation, distribution, aggregation, storage, supply or energy efficiency services; provides clarification on pre-existing provisions on smart meters, single points of contacts, and rights to out-of-court settlement, universal service and vulnerable consumers. Distribution system operation (DSO) : the text clarifies the tasks of DSOs, notably relating to the activities of DSOs concerning the procurement of network services to ensure flexibility, the integration of electrical vehicles and data management. It also clarifies the role of DSOs with respect to storage and recharging points for electric vehicles. General rules applicable to the transmission system operator (TSO) : this Chapter summarises the rules, providing only some clarifications concerning ancillary services and the new Regional Operational Centres. Unbundling of TSOs : the rules on unbundling as developed in the Third Energy Package, remains unchanged as concerns the main substantive rules on unbundling, notably with respect to the three regimes for TSOs (ownership unbundling, independent system operator and independent transmission operator), as well as with respect to the provisions on TSO designation and certification. It only provides a clarification on the possibility for TSOs to own storage or to provide ancillary services. Independent system operator : the proposal notably emphasises the obligation of regulators to cooperate with neighbouring regulators and ACER in case issues of cross-border relevance are concerned and updates the list of tasks of regulators, inter alia with respect to the supervision of the newly created Regional Operational Centres. Final provisions : this Chapter changes some general provisions, inter alia on derogations to the Directive, exercise of delegated powers by the Commission and the Committee established under comitology rules pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. The new Annexes to the proposed Directive set out more requirements on comparison tools, billing and billing information and amends pre-existing requirements for smart meters and their roll-out.

The share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E) has steeply increased, and this shift will continue as it is a key condition to fulfilling the Union's obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate. The physical nature of RES-E ‚Äì more variable, less predictable and decentralised than traditional generation ‚Äì requires an adaptation of market and grid operation rules to the more flexible nature of the market. In parallel, state interventions, often designed in an uncoordinated manner, have led to distortions of the wholesale electricity market, with negative consequences for investments and cross-border trade.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this endorsed an enhancement of current market rules in order to create a level-playing field among all generation technologies and resources by removing existing market distortions. It addresses rules that discriminate between resources and which limit or favour the access of certain technologies to the electricity grid. In addition, all market participants would bear financial responsibility for imbalances caused on the grid and all resources would be remunerated in the market on equal terms. Barriers to demand-response would be removed. The chosen option would also strengthen short-term markets by bringing them closer to real-time CONTENT : the draft regulation contains seven Chapters, which may be summarised as follows: Subject-matter : the proposal aims at: setting the basis for an efficient achievement of the objectives of the European Energy Union and in particular the climate and energy framework for 2030 by enabling market signals to be delivered for increased flexibility, decarbonisation and innovation; setting fundamental principles for well-functioning, integrated electricity markets, which allow non-discriminatory market access for all resource providers and electricity customers, empower consumers, enable demand response and energy efficiency. General rules for the electricity market : new provisions set out the key principles to be respected by national energy legislation in order to allow for a functioning internal electricity market. The text also sets out the main legal principles for electricity trading rules within different trading timeframes (balancing, intraday, day-ahead and forward markets), including principles for price formation. It clarifies the principle of balancing responsibility and provides for a framework for more market compatible rules for the dispatch and curtailment of generation and demand response. Network access and congestion management : this Chapter describes the process to define bidding zones in a coordinated manner. In order to address the persisting problem of significant national limitations to cross-border electricity flows, the conditions for such exceptional limitations are clarified, notably by rules that shall ensure that electricity imports and exports are not restricted by national actors for economic reasons. The Chapter contains amendments to pre-existing principles for transmission and distribution network tariffs and sets a procedure for fostering the progressive convergence of transmission and distribution tariff methodologies. It also sets out amended rules for the usage of congestion rents. Resource adequacy : this Chapter sets out principles and a procedure for the development of a European resource adequacy assessment to better determine the need for capacity mechanisms and, if appropriate, the setting of a reliability standard by Member States. It clarifies how and under which conditions capacity mechanisms can be introduced in a market-compatible manner. It also clarifies market compatible design principles for capacity mechanisms, including rules for the participation of capacity located in another Member State and for interconnection usage. It sets out how Regional Operational Centres, national TSOs, the ENTSO for electricity and national regulators via ACER will be involved in the development of technical parameters for the participation of capacities located in another Member State as well as the operational rules for their participation. Transmission system operation (TSO) : the Chapter sets out the tasks and duties of the European network of transmission system operators for electricity (ENTSO) and the monitoring tasks of ACER in this regard whilst clarifying its duty to act independently and for the European good. It defines the mission of Regional Operational Centres and provides for criteria and a procedure for defining system operation regions covered by each Regional Operational Centre and the coordination functions that these centres perform. It also sets out working and organisational arrangements, consultation requirements, procedures for the adoption of decisions and recommendations and their revision, the composition and responsibilities of the management board and liability arrangements of Regional Operational Centres. The Chapter also incorporates rules on the connection of cogeneration units, previously included in Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency. The rules on a ten-year network development plan, inter-transmission system operator compensation, information exchange and certification remain largely unchanged. Distribution system operation (DSO) : the draft regulation sets up a European entity for DSOs, defines a procedure for its establishment and its tasks including with regard to the consultation of stakeholders. It also provides detailed rules on the cooperation between DSOs and TSOs with regard to the planning and operation of their networks. Network codes and guidelines : the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts in the form of network codes or guidelines. The text provides for clarifications as to the legal nature and the adoption of network codes and guidelines and enlarges their possible content to areas such as distribution tariff structures. It also includes the European entity for DSOs and other stakeholders more closely in the procedure on the development of proposals for electricity network codes. Final provisions : this includes the pre-existing rules for the exemption of new direct current interconnectors from certain requirement of the Electricity Directive and Regulation whilst clarifying the procedure for subsequent amendments made by NRAs. The Annex to the proposed Regulation defines in more detail the functions attributed to the Regional Operational Centers created by the Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS:"

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Parliament adopted a resolution in September 2016 stressing that a well-functioning integrated energy market is the best tool to guarantee affordable energy prices, secure energy supplies and to allow for the integration and development of larger volumes of electricity produced from renewable sources in a cost efficient manner. The current electricity market design is based on the rules of the Third Energy Package, adopted in 2009. The latter has brought tangible progress for consumers but new developments have led to fundamental changes in European electricity markets. These include (i) an increase in the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources (RES-E); (ii) state interventions leading to distortions of the wholesale electricity market, with negative consequences for investments and cross-border trade; (iii) significant changes are also taking place on the technological side. The electricity market design initiative aims to adapt the current market rules to new market realities. It also appears appropriate to also adapt regulatory oversight to the new realities of the market. National regulators currently take all main regulatory decisions even in cases where a common regional solution is needed. While ACER has been successful in providing a forum for the coordination of national regulators with diverging interests, its main role is currently confined to coordination, advising and monitoring. While market actors increasingly cooperate across borders and decide on certain matters concerning grid operation and electricity trading with qualified majority at a regional or even Union level, there is no equivalent for these regional decision-making procedures at regulatory level. Regulatory oversight therefore remains fragmented, leading to a risk of diverging decisions and unnecessary delays. Strengthening the powers of ACER for those cross-border issues that require a coordinated regional decision would contribute to faster and more effective decision-making on cross-border issues. Accordingly, the Commission feels it necessary to amend the Regulation (EC) No 713/2009 establishing ACER. The proposal for a recast of the Regulation on the electricity market, the proposal for the recast of the Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity, and this proposal on the recast of the Regulation establishing a European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators are part of the Commission's broader package of initiatives (""Clean Energy for All""). That Package comprises the Commission's key proposals to implement the Energy Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: legislative options to improve ACER on the basis of the existing framework were thus considered. The option endorsed by the Impact Assessment enables the adaptation of the EU institutional framework to the new realities of the electricity system. CONTENT: the main points of the proposal are as follows: Objectives and tasks : the proposal preserves the main role of ACER as a coordinator of the action of national regulators has been preserved. Limited additional competences have been assigned to ACER in those areas where fragmented national decision-making on issues with cross-border relevance would lead to problems or inconsistencies for the internal market. For example, the creation of regional operational centres (ROCs) in the proposal for a recast of the Directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity calls for supra-national monitoring which needs to be performed by ACER, as the ROCs cover several Member States. Similarly, the introduction of an EU-wide coordinated adequacy assessment in the recast of Regulation 714/2009 on the internal electricity market calls for a regulatory approval of its methodology and calculations that may only be attributed to ACER as the adequacy assessment is to be performed across Member States. While the assignment of new tasks to ACER will require a reinforcement of its staff, the coordinating role of ACER will lead to a lower burden for national authorities, thus freeing up administrative resources at national level. The proposed approach will streamline regulatory procedures (e.g. by introducing direct approval within ACER instead of 28 separate approvals). The coordinated development of methodologies (e.g. concerning adequacy assessment) will reduce the workload for national authorities and avoid extra work resulting from potential problems through non-aligned national regulatory action. The list of tasks has been updated to include ACER's duties in the field of wholesale market supervision and cross-border infrastructure, which were attributed to ACER subsequent to the adoption of the Regulation. With respect to the adoption of electricity network codes, ACER is given more responsibility in elaborating and submitting the final proposal for a network code to the Commission, while maintaining ENTSO-E's role as a technical expert. The proposal also includes a formal place for DSOs to be represented at EU level, notably in the development of network code proposals, in line with an increase in their responsibilities. The Agency is given the competence to decide on terms, methodologies and algorithms for the implementation of electricity network codes and guidelines. For tasks in a regional context concerning only a limited number of national regulators, a regional decision-making process is introduced. Accordingly, the Director would have to give his opinion on whether the issue in question is primarily of regional relevance. If the Board of Regulators agrees that this is the case a regional sub-committee of the Board of Regulators should prepare the decision in question, which would finally be taken or rejected by the Board of Regulators itself. Otherwise the Board of Regulators would decide without the intervention of a regional sub-committee. The proposal also defines a number of new tasks for ACER concerning the coordination of certain functions related to the Regional Operational Centres within the Agency, concerning the supervision of Nominated Electricity Market Operators and related to the approval of methods and proposal related to generation adequacy and risk preparedness. The main features of the existing governance structure, in particular the Board of Regulators, are preserved. It should be noted that, in general, the rules concerning ACER are adapted to the Common Approach EU on decentralised agencies agreed between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. However, the Commission states that limited deviations from the Common Approach is warranted since it considers it premature to transfer decision-making powers to a Management Board as provided for in the Common Approach.

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: even where markets and systems function well, the risk of an electricity crisis as a result of a variety of circumstances (e.g. extreme weather circumstances, malicious attacks including cyber-attacks, a fuel shortage) cannot be excluded. In addition, given that electricity systems are integrated, where crisis situations occur, they often have a cross-border effect. Some circumstances (e.g., a prolonged cold spell or heat wave) might affect several Member States at the same time and even incidents that start locally they may rapidly spread across borders. Currently, Member States behave very differently when it comes to preventing, preparing for and managing crisis situations. National rules and practices tend to focus on the national context only, disregarding what happens across borders. The assessment of the national legal frameworks and current practices across Europe has shown that: (a) Member States assess different risks; (b) Member States take different sets of measures to prevent and manage crisis situations, and that such measures are triggered at different moments in time; (c) roles and responsibilities differ; and (d) there is not common understanding as to what constitutes a crisis situation. This situation is the result of a regulatory gap . The current EU legal framework (Directive 2005/89/EC and Directive 2009/72/EC) only sets general objectives for security of supply, leaving Member States to decide how to achieve these. In particular, while the rules allow Member States to take ‚Äòsafeguard measures‚Äô in crisis situations, they do not set out how Member States should prepare for and manage such situations. The current legislation no longer reflects the reality of today‚Äôs interconnected electricity market, where the likelihood of crisis situations affecting several Member States at the same time is on the rise. The proposed Regulation complements the provisions of the Third Energy Package, which is revised in parallel. (Please see 2016/0379(COD), 2016/0380(COD), and 2016/0378(COD)). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined a number of options. The preferred option seeks to establish a greater comparability and transparency across Member States in the area of risk preparedness. In particular, regionally coordinated plans ensure that risks are identified at regional level and that consistent measures are adopted to prevent and manage crisis situations. The results of simulations show that well-integrated markets and regional coordination during periods of extreme weather conditions are crucial in addressing the hours of system stress (high demand) and minimising the probability of interruption of electricity supply. CONTENT: the Regulation lays down rules for the cooperation between Member States in view of preventing, preparing for and handling electricity crises in a spirit of solidarity and transparency and in full regard for the requirements of a competitive internal market for electricity. The proposed Regulation contains the following elements: Common rules on crisis prevention and tools to ensure cross-border cooperation : the main provisions are as follows: Member States should designate a competent authority to be in charge of carrying out the tasks set out in the Regulation, in particular drafting the risk preparedness plan; Member States must draw up risk-preparedness plans, after consulting stakeholders, in order to ensure maximum preparedness for electricity crisis situations and an effective management of such situations should they occur. The plans should be developed on the basis of electricity crisis scenarios identified by ENTSOE and Member States, respectively, and set out the measures planned or taken to prevent and mitigate the scenarios; before adopting a plan, the competent authority should submit a draft to the competent authorities in the region and to the Electricity Coordination Group for consultation. After consultation, the final plan should be sent to the Commission, made public and updated every three years, unless circumstances warrant more frequent updates; plans should consist of two parts, setting out national measures and coordinated measures agreed between the Member States in each region. They should take account of the specific characteristics of each Member State and set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of the competent authorities; all measures contained in the plans should be clearly set out, transparent, proportionate, non-discriminatory and verifiable. They should not endanger the security of electricity supply of other Member States or of the Union as a whole; and the plans should include measures to ensure that simultaneous crisis situations are properly prevented and managed. They must be agreed in a regional context and include specified elements set out in the text, including measures to mitigate the impact of a crisis. Managing electricity crisis situations : the proposal requires Member States to inform neighbouring Member States and the Commission without delay in the event of an electricity crisis situation. They must also provide information on the causes of the crisis, measures taken and planned to mitigate it and the possible need for assistance from other Member States. In addition: Member States are required to inform the Commission and the Electricity Coordination Group if they have specific, serious and reliable information that an event may occur that is likely to result in a significant deterioration of electricity supply; Member States are to cooperate in a spirit of solidarity to prepare for and manage electricity crisis situations, with a view to ensuring that electricity is delivered where it is most needed, in return for compensation; and in the event of an electricity crisis, Member States must act in full compliance with internal electricity market rules. Non-market based measures can be used only as a last resort and must be necessary, proportionate, non-discriminatory and temporary. Security of supply indicators and risk assessments : the proposal requires ENTSO-E to develop a methodology for identifying electricity crisis scenarios at regional level, considering at least the following risks: rare and extreme natural hazards; accidental hazards going beyond N-1 security criterion; consequential hazards such as fuel shortages; and malicious attacks; For the preparation of the risk preparedness plan, ENTSO-E should: (i) use this methodology to identify the most relevant crisis scenarios; (ii) develop a methodology for assessing short-term adequacy, namely seasonal adequacy as well as week-ahead to intraday generation adequacy forecasts. Once ACER has approved this, Member States and ENTSOE should use it in their short-term assessments. The short-term adequacy assessment proposed complements the long-term resource adequacy assessment proposed in the revised Electricity Regulation, which ensures a coordinated European adequacy assessment to assess the need for capacity mechanisms. Evaluation and monitoring : in order to ensure transparency following an electricity crisis, Member States affected should carry out an ex-post evaluation of the crisis and its impacts. The proposal involves systematic monitoring via the Electricity Coordination Group, of security of supply in the EU. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only budgetary impact associated to this proposal (part of the recast of the Third Package) concerns the resources of the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER). Essentially, the new tasks to be carried out by ACER require a phasing in of 18 additional full-time staff in the Agency in 2020, as well as corresponding financial resources amounting to EUR 1 038 000 in 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the growth potential of e-commerce has not yet been fully exploited. Differences in national consumer contract law rules and a lack of clear contract law rules are among the key obstacles that hinder the development of the supply of digital content. Only 18% of consumers who used the Internet for private purposes in 2014 purchased online from another EU country while 55% did so domestically. Consumers suffer detriment due to lack of clear contractual rights for faulty digital content. Different national contract law rules have created one-off costs for retailers selling to consumers of approximately EUR 4 billion. These costs mostly affect micro and small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The Digital Single Market Strategy adopted by the Commission on 6 May 2015 announced a legislative initiative on harmonised rules for the supply of digital content and online sales of goods. This initiative is composed of (i) a proposal on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content, and (ii) a proposal on certain aspects concerning contracts for the online and other distance sales of goods. By eliminating the key barriers related to contract law hindering cross-border trade, the rules put forward in the proposals will reduce the uncertainty faced by businesses and consumers that is due to the complexity of the legal framework and the costs incurred by businesses resulting from differences in contract law between Member States. Drawing on the experience acquired during the negotiations for a Regulation on a Common European Sales Law, they no longer follow the approach of an optional regime and a comprehensive set of rules. Instead, the proposals contain a targeted and focused set of fully harmonised rules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined 5 policy alternatives, and concluded that fully harmonised rules for digital content and goods would best meet the policy objectives. This option will reduce contract law-related costs for traders and facilitate cross-border e-commerce. Businesses will be able to rely largely on their own law when selling cross-border, as the main rules, which are relevant for cross-border trade, will be the same in all Member States. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to fully harmonise a set of key rules concerning contracts for the supply of digital content. It includes rules on: (i) conformity of the digital content, (ii) remedies available to consumers in cases of lack of conformity of digital content with the contract, as well as (iii) certain aspects concerning the right to terminate a long term contract and the modification of the digital content. Definitions: some definitions stem from the current acquis, such as the definition of a consumer, while others reflect the specificity of digital content. The definition of digital content is deliberately broad and encompasses all types of digital content, including downloaded or web streamed movies, cloud storage, social media or visual modelling files for 3D printing, in order to be future-proof and to avoid distortions of competition and to create a level playing field. Scope: the proposal covers only business-to-consumer transactions, and the supply of all types of digital content. It also covers digital content supplied not only for a monetary payment but also in exchange for (personal and other) data provided by consumers, except where the data have been collected for the sole purpose of meeting legal requirements. Excluded from the scope of the proposal are services performed with a significant element of human intervention or contracts governing specific sectorial services such as healthcare, gambling or financial services. In case of conflict between the Directive and another EU act, the other EU act takes precedence. Full harmonisation : the proposal precludes Member States from adopting or maintaining laws remaining below or going beyond the requirements of the Directive. Supply of digital content: the digital content must be supplied to the consumer or to a third party which operates a physical or virtual facility allowing processing of, access to or transmission of digital content to the final consumer and with which the consumer is in a contractual relation. As a default rule, the digital content should be supplied instantly unless the parties agree otherwise. Conformity of digital content with contract: the digital content must primarily conform to what was promised in the contract. In the absence of such explicit benchmarks, the conformity of the digital content must be assessed according to an objective criterion, i.e. it must be fit for the purpose for which digital content of the same description would normally be used. The proposal also stipulates that: when the digital content is supplied over a period of time, it must be in conformity with the contract throughout the duration of the contract; the version of digital content supplied to the consumer must also be the most recent version available at the time of the conclusion of contract; a lack of conformity of the digital content resulting from an incorrect integration into the consumer's hardware and software should be equal to a lack of conformity of the digital content itself if the reasons for the incorrect integration are in the sphere of the supplier; the digital content must be cleared from any third-party rights, including those based on intellectual property. Burden of proof : the burden of proof for the absence of lack of conformity is imposed on the supplier, unless the consumer's digital environment is not compatible with the digital content. This reversal of the burden of proof is not limited in time. Liability of the supplier : the proposal sets out the cases of liability of the supplier towards the consumer, namely where the digital content is not in conformity with the contract or the supplier failed to supply the digital content altogether. Given that digital content may be supplied over a period of time, the supplier should also be liable for any lack of conformity that occurs during that period. Termination, damages, and right of redress : the proposal: gives the right to the consumer to terminate the contract immediately when the supplier failed to supply the digital content altogether. The supplier shall reimburse the price or, if the counter-performance consisted of data, refrain from using these data and any other information which the consumer has provided in exchange for the digital content; lists the remedies available to the consumer in case of any failure to supply or lack of conformity of the digital content: (i) in a first step, the consumer shall be entitled to have the digital content brought to conformity within a reasonable time, without significant inconvenience and without incurring any costs; (ii) in a second step, the consumer shall be entitled to have the price reduced or the contract terminated if the lack of conformity relates to main performance features; establishes a right to damages restricted to cases where damage has been done to the digital content and hardware of the consumer. However, Member States should lay down the detailed conditions for the exercise of the right to damages; lists the conditions under which the supplier can modify the contract for the supply of digital content as regards main performance features; establishes the conditions under which the consumer has a right to terminate contracts concluded for an indeterminate duration or for duration exceeding 12 months and thereby is able to switch provider; provides the supplier with a right to redress in case of an act or omission by a person in earlier links of the chain of transactions that triggered the supplier's liability for lack of conformity or a failure to supply towards the consumer. Lastly, the proposal requires Member States to ensure that adequate and effective means exist to ensure compliance with this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amended proposal). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union rules applicable to the online and other distance sales of goods are still fragmented although rules on pre-contractual information requirements, the right of withdrawal for distance contracts and delivery conditions have already been fully harmonised. Other key contractual elements such as the conformity criteria, the remedies and modalities for their exercise for goods which do not conform to the contract are currently subject to minimum harmonisation in Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The minimum harmonisation character of the Directive 1999/44/EC on consumer sales and guarantees (CSGD) has led to differences in consumer contract law rules, resulting from national mandatory rules going beyond the minimum standards laid down by the Union. Consequently, there are now significant differences between the national provisions transposing Union law on consumer contract law relating to essential elements of a contract of sale, the absence or existence of a hierarchy of remedies, the period of the legal guarantee, the period of the reversal of the burden of proof, or the notification of the defect to the seller. Those differences create obstacles to cross-border trade and therefore have a direct effect on the establishment and functioning of the internal market and limit competition. On 9 December 2015, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content, and a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain aspects concerning contracts for the online and other distance sales of goods. These proposals aim to contribute to fostering growth through the creation of a true Digital Single Market by eliminating the key contract law-related barriers hindering cross-border trade. During the discussions on the proposal in the European Parliament and in the Council, the co-legislators stressed the need to have coherent rules for distance and face-to-face sales. The Parliament rapporteurs of both the lead committee for the Internal Market and Consumer protection (IMCO) and the associated committee for Legal Affairs (JURI) for the proposal on online and other distance sales have tabled amendments which extend its scope to all contracts of sale concluded between a seller and a consumer. In that context, IMCO requested the European Parliamentary Research Service to conduct an ex-ante impact assessment in order to assess the impacts of these amendments. This Parliament impact assessment was published on 14 July 2017 and its conclusions support the need to have coherent rules for all sales, which would benefit both businesses and consumers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an impact assessment was carried out for the initial proposal. In the Commission Staff Working Document accompanying the amended proposal, the Commission supplemented this impact assessment with an analysis of the findings and data gathered through the Fitness Check and taking into account the impact assessment prepared by the European Parliamentary Research Service. The Staff Working Document presents a comprehensive overview of the impacts of fully harmonised rules on contracts for the sales of goods for businesses, consumers and ultimately for Member States and the EU digital and internal market. The Commission's analysis shows that problems arising from different national rules implementing Directive 1999/44/EC on consumer sales and guarantees are relevant both for distance sales and for face-to-face sales. CONTENT: the amended proposal extends the scope of the original proposal which was limited to online and other distance sales to face-to-face sales. Specifically, the proposal lays down certain requirements concerning distance sales contracts concluded between the seller and the consumer, in particular: (i) rules on conformity of goods; (ii) remedies in case of non-conformity; (iii) the modalities for the exercise of these remedies. The level of consumer protection shall be increased compared to Directive 1999/44/EC. This Directive shall not apply to distance contracts for the provision of services. However, in case of sales contracts providing both for the sale of goods and the provision of services, this Directive shall apply to the part relating to the sale of goods. This Directive shall not apply to goods like DVDs and CDs incorporating digital content in such a way that the goods function only as a carrier of the digital content.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Agreement establishing the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM Agreement) provides an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilisation of living marine resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels which are considered sustainable and at low risk of collapse. The European Union, as well as Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Slovenia are contracting parties to the GFCM Agreement. Recommendations adopted by the GFCM are binding on its contracting parties. As the Union is a contracting party to the GFCM Agreement, those recommendations are binding on the Union and should therefore be implemented in Union law unless their content is already covered thereby. The transposition of the relevant GFCM provisions is necessary to ensure that the latter will receive uniform and effective application throughout the European Union. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 in order to transpose in Union law a number of measures adopted by the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) at its annual sessions of 2015, 2016 and 2017. The proposal is consistent with the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). It covers conservation measures, management measures, monitoring, control and surveillance measures and measures to fight illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. These measures concern the European hake and the deep-water rose shrimp in the Strait of Sicily the turbot in the Black Sea, the blackspot seabream in the Alboran Sea and the red coral. The proposal also establishes a fishing restricted area in Adriatic (Jabuka/PomoPit area)."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 96/53/EC laying down for certain road vehicles circulating within the Community the maximum authorised dimensions in national and international traffic and the maximum authorised weights in international traffic was last revised by Directive (EU) 2015/719 of the European Parliament and of the Council, one of the aims of Directive (EU) 2015/719 was to improve the aerodynamics of motor vehicles falling within the scope of the Directive by allowing these to derogate from maximum lengths restrictions if certain conditions were respected. The derogation from maximum length restrictions was granted for the rear of vehicles, for the mounting of aerodynamic devices, and for the front of vehicles 4 to allow for a more rounded and aerodynamic shape of cabs of trucks. Directive (EU) 2015/719 also included a moratorium of three years for the introduction of aerodynamic cabs after the date of transposition or application of the necessary amendments as regards technical type-approval requirements. The moratorium deters manufacturers from improving aerodynamics of cabs as a way to achieve compliance with the upcoming CO2 standards for heavy goods vehicles. Considering that CO2 emissions from road transport represent a quarter of all CO2 emissions in the EU and that emissions from road transport are projected to grow by 6% in the period 2015 -2030, the Commission considers that the benefits of elongated cabs should be harvested as quickly as possible. The proposal contributes directly to the first political priority of the Juncker Commission: jobs, growth and investment by allowing truck manufacturers and equipment suppliers to innovate and produce new models of heavy goods vehicles. It is also intended to contribute to the energy union and climate priority, through a lowering of emissions from heavy goods vehicles. CONTENT: this proposal only advances the date from which on more aerodynamic and/or safer cabins may be used as already provided for since Directive 2015/719. H owever, the shortened deadline would remain proportionate and would still allow sufficient time for Member States to take the necessary measures."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient, more resource-efficient and circular economy are key in ensuring long-term competitiveness of the Union economy. In March 2018, the Commission published its action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth', setting up an ambitious and comprehensive strategy on sustainable finance. One of the objectives of that action plan is to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. In line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Agenda, this proposal is part of a broader Commission initiative to facilitate investment in sustainable projects and assets across the European Union. Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes uniform rules for benchmarks in the Union and caters for different types of benchmark. By introducing new categories of ‚Äòlow carbon‚Äô or ‚Äòpositive carbon impact‚Äô benchmarks, this proposal aims to help investors compare the carbon footprint of investments. The proposal is being presented in parallel with a proposal to bring institutional investors to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their internal processes and to inform their clients. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred approach provides for the adoption of a new framework establishing minimum standards for the harmonisation of the methodology to be applied to the low carbon or positive carbon impact benchmarks. The use of EU harmonised standards for transparent methodologies would result in the development of benchmarks which would be better suited to measuring the performance of a portfolio or financial product that either follows a low-carbon or the 20C objective investment strategy, respectively. In terms of environmental impacts, it will relatively quickly redirect financing into assets and projects with sustainable goals that have a positive impact in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. CONTENT: Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes uniform rules for benchmarks in the Union and caters for different types of benchmark. The proposal establishes a number of minimum key elements of the methodology used to determine decarbonised benchmarks and positive carbon impact benchmarks, providing standards for the criteria and methods used to select and weight the underlying assets of the benchmark, and to calculate the carbon footprint and carbon savings associated. These new market standards should reflect the carbon footprint of companies and provide more information to investors about the carbon footprint of an investment portfolio. To enable market players to make well-informed choices, benchmark administrators should be required to disclose how their methodology takes into account the ESG factors for each benchmark or family of benchmarks that is promoted as pursuing ESG objectives. That information should also be disclosed in the benchmark statement. Moreover, administrators of low-carbon and of positive carbon impact benchmarks should equally publish their methodology used for their calculation. That information should describe how the underlying assets were selected and weighted and which assets were excluded and for what reason."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements concluded on 30 June 2005 under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law makes a valuable contribution to promoting party autonomy in international commercial transactions and increasing the predictability of judicial solutions in such transactions. In particular, the Convention ensures the necessary legal certainty for the parties that their choice of court agreement is respected and that a judgment given by the chosen court is eligible for recognition and enforcement in cross-border situations. Article 29 of the Convention allows Regional Economic Organisations such us the European Union to sign, accept, approve or accede to the Convention. The Convention affects Union secondary legislation on jurisdiction based on choice by the parties and the recognition and enforcement of the resulting judgments, in particular Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation) (to be replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 as of 10 January 2015), it is in the interests of the European Union to approve the Hague Convention so that it enters into force on the same date of the entry into application of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012. Moreover, the Union, should, when approving the Convention, make the declaration allowed under Article 21 excluding from the scope of the Convention insurance contracts in general, subject to defined exceptions in order to preserve the protective jurisdictional rules available to the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary in insurance contracts under Section 3 of Regulation (EC) 44/2001. The exclusion should be limited to whatever is necessary to protect the interests of the weaker parties in insurance contracts. The Convention was signed by the Union on 1 April 2009 on the basis of the Council Decision 2009/397/EC. It is now necessary to approve the Convention on behalf of the EU. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2), in conjunction with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is requested to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the EU, the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. Having the EU approve the Convention would reduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside the EU by ensuring that choice of court agreements included in their contracts are respected and that judgments issued by the courts designated in such agreements would be eligible for recognition and enforcement in the other Contracting Parties to the Convention. Overall, approval of the Convention by the EU would complement the realisation of the aims underlying the EU rules on the prorogation of jurisdiction, by creating a harmonised set of rules within the EU in respect of third states which will become Contracting Parties to the Convention. The Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements: the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements is designed to offer greater legal certainty and predictability for parties involved in business-to-business agreements and international litigation by creating an optional worldwide judicial dispute resolution mechanism alternative to the existing arbitration system. In particular, the objective of the Convention is to promote international trade and investment through enhanced judicial cooperation by introducing uniform rules on jurisdiction based on exclusive choice of court agreements and on the recognition and enforcement of judgments given by the chosen courts in its Contracting Parties. The Convention seeks to achieve a balance between: (i) the need to guarantee to the parties that only the courts chosen by them will hear the case and that the resulting judgment will be recognised and enforced abroad, and (ii) the need to allow States to pursue some aspects of their public policy, related in particular to the protection of weaker parties, protection against serious unfairness in particular situations and guaranteed respect for some grounds of exclusive jurisdiction of States. How the Convention relates to the Brussels I Regulation: the Convention affects the application of the Brussels I Regulation if at least one of the parties is resident in a Contracting State to the Convention. The Convention will prevail over the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation except if both parties are EU residents or come from third states, not Contracting Parties to the Convention. The Convention will give EU business the necessary legal certainty that their choice of court agreements in favour of a court outside the EU are respected in the EU, and that agreements in favour of a court in the EU are respected in third States. It will also ensure that EU businesses can be confident that a judgment given by the chosen court in the EU is eligible for recognition and enforcement in third states, Contracting Parties to the Convention, and vice versa. Declaration on insurance contracts: the Brussels I Regulation (Section 3) provides for special protective jurisdiction in matters of insurance aimed at protecting the weaker party (the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary) and the economic interests of the general public of the place where the weaker party is located. The insured party, as plaintiff, therefore has a choice of suing the insurer at several places, including the place where the insured party is domiciled; the insurer, as plaintiff, can sue the insured party in principle only where the latter is domiciled. These protective jurisdiction rules are based on the premise that the insured party is always the weaker party, even if he acts as a commercial operator in B2B relations. There is no change to this presumption in the Brussels I Regulation (recast). For this reason, the possibility of the parties concluding the choice of court agreement has been limited (Article 13 of the Regulation). The Convention on its part applies to insurance matters without limiting party autonomy to conclude choice of court agreements. The only substantive limitation results from Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention which excludes insurance contracts entered into by private persons as consumers. This is partially contrary to the regime established in the Brussels I Regulation insofar as, for instance, the Convention would apply to insurance contracts concluded by SMEs. Once the Convention is approved by the EU, certain insurance contracts which now fall under the Brussels I Regulation, e.g. contracts between an EU policyholder and the EU branch of an insurer with headquarters outside the EU (Article 9(2) of the Regulation) would fall within the scope of the Convention (Article 26(6), in conjunction with Article 4(2) of the Convention). Therefore, if the Convention were to be concluded without excluding insurance contracts, there would be a lack of parallelism with the protective policy established in the Brussels I Regulation which allows the insured party to sue an EU insurer (or a EU branch of third State insurer) in his own place of domicile irrespective of any other jurisdiction available under a choice of court agreement. Other technical provisions have been included for the EU to exclude certain types of insurance matters falling within the scope of the Convention, without laying down additional conditions. The carve-out is as small as is needed to achieve the goal of protecting the interests of weaker parties in insurance contracts as reflected in the protective jurisdiction rules of the Brussels I Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council constituted the Union regulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution of veterinary medicinal products. In the light of the experience acquired and following the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal market for veterinary medicinal products, the Commission has presented a proposal that will repeal and replace Directive 2001/82/EC on veterinary medicinal products. This proposal lays down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to take account of the fact that centralised marketing authorisation for veterinary products is being decoupled from that for medicines for humans. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission‚Äôs Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 so as to: delete from Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the provisions regarding granting and maintaining marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products . The rules on marketing authorisations valid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation on veterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinal products will cover all routes granting marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products in the Union ‚Äì both at centralised and national level; establish certain principles applicable to fees payable to the Agency , including the need to take into account, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon; align the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to Articles 290 and 291 (delegated and implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. As set out in the legislative financial statement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: livestock production occupies a very important place in the agriculture of the Union. There are 13.7 million animal holdings in the EU. The value of livestock farming output in the EU is EUR 157 billion. In addition, the protection of animal health constitutes one of the general objectives of EU food law. The rules concerning medicated feed have significant influence on the keeping and on the rearing of animals, including non-food producing animals, and on the production of products of animal origin. Council Directive 90/167/EEC constitutes the Union‚Äôs regulatory framework for the manufacture, placing on the market and use of medicated feed. Experience with the application of Directive 90/167/EEC has shown that further measures should be taken to strengthen the effective functioning of the Internal Market and to explicitly give and improve the possibility to treat non-food producing animals by medicated feed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment identified the following main axes along which the system has to change in order to answer the stakeholders concerns: residues of veterinary medicines in feed, imprecise dosage of veterinary medicines, impossible market access to medicated feed for pets and barriers to intra EU trade of medicated feed. The impact assessment concluded that an EU Regulation with detailed rules would have the most positive impacts and would provide for the best way forward to achieve the objectives for the EU. The impact assessment concluded that an EU Regulation with detailed rules would have the most positive impacts and would provide for the best way forward to achieve the objectives for the EU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to update the current legislation on medicated feed by repealing Directive 90/167/EEC which sets out the conditions under which medicated animal feed may be manufactured, placed on the market and used within the EU. The main elements of the proposed Regulation include: Scope : the scope of the proposed Regulation covers the manufacture, placing on the market and use of medicated feed for use in pets and in food-producing animals within the Union. It does not apply to veterinary medicinal products used as the medicinal component of medicated feed (previously called ""medicated premixes""), which are dealt with under the veterinary medicinal products legislation. Manufacture, composition, placing on the market and use of medicated feed : the proposal: ensure that the general manufacture requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 apply; stipulates that medicated feed may only be manufactured from veterinary medicinal products authorised under the veterinary medicinal products legislation; sets rules for the approval of feed business operators and rules they need to comply with in order to manufacture medicated feed; lays down rules for the homogenous incorporation of the veterinary medicinal products into the medicated feed and requirements in order to avoid carry-over of active substances from veterinary medicinal products into non target feed. Labelling : the proposal provides that as regards labelling, the general provisions laid down in Regulation (EC) No 767/2009 on the placing on the market and use of feed should apply and that it be subject to specific labelling requirements in order to provide the user with the information necessary to correctly administer the medicated feed. It should also ensure that: specific rules for the prescription, the validity of the prescription, the use of medicated feed containing antimicrobials in food-producing animals and the quantities required for the treatment of animals with medicated feed are laid down; manufacturers, distributors and users of medicated feed are keep daily records for the effective tracing of medicated feed; for veterinary medicinal products authorised at national level, the Regulation sets Intra-Union rules for trade of medicated feed in order to prevent distortions in competition. DELEGATED ACT: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 establishing the European Banking Authority (EBA), the EBA is established in London, UK. Following the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to leave the Union, the 27 remaining Member States, in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50), selected Paris, France, as the new seat for the European Banking Authority CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 1093/2010 in order to confirm the new seat of the EBA in Paris, France. The EBA should occupy its new seat from the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom or from 30 March 2019, whichever is the earlier. It is proposed that the Regulation shall enter into force as a matter of urgency in order to give the European Banking Authority sufficient time to relocate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the relocation of the European Banking Authority will have budgetary implications, in particular in view of the costs related to the early termination of its current rental contract in London as a consequence of the withdrawal, the costs related to the move itself and the costs related to the installation in the new premises in Paris. As set out in the negotiation directives of the Council of 22 May 2017, the United Kingdom should fully cover the specific costs related to the withdrawal process, such as the relocation of the agencies based in the United Kingdom. Some of the relocation costs (e.g. costs related to the move itself) may have to be pre-financed by the EU budget prior to the final financial settlement. If necessary, the Commission will submit the relevant proposals to the European Parliament and the Council in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure for 2019 and, if necessary, for 2018. In addition, the costs related to the installation in the new premises will also be presented in the context of the building procedure set out in Article 203 of the Financial Regulation, which requires prior approval from the European Parliament and the Council before contracts related to building projects are concluded.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Medicines Agency has been established by Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93, which has been replaced by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. In accordance with the Decision of 29 October 1993 taken by common agreement between the representatives of the governments of the Member States, meeting at Head of State and Government level, on the location of the seats of certain bodies and departments of the European Communities and of Europol, the European Medicines Agency has its seat in London, United Kingdom. Following the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to leave the Union, the 27 remaining Member States, in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50), selected Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as the new seat for the European Medicines Agency. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 in order to confirm the new seat of the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Agency should occupy its new seat from the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom or from 30 March 2019, whichever is the earlier. It is proposed that the Regulation shall enter into force as a matter of urgency in order to give the Agency sufficient time to relocate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the relocation of the Agency will have budgetary implications, in particular in view of the costs related to the early termination of its current rental contract in London as a consequence of the withdrawal, the costs related to the move itself and the costs related to the installation in the new premises in Amsterdam. As set out in the negotiation directives of the Council of 22 May 2017, the United Kingdom should fully cover the specific costs related to the withdrawal process, such as the relocation of the agencies based in the United Kingdom. Some of the relocation costs (e.g. costs related to the move itself) may have to be pre-financed by the EU budget prior to the final financial settlement. If necessary, the Commission will submit the relevant proposals to the European Parliament and the Council in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure for 2019 and, if necessary, for 2018. In addition, the costs related to the installation in the new premises will also be presented in the context of the building procedure set out in Article 203 of the Financial Regulation, which requires prior approval from the European Parliament and the Council before contracts related to building projects are concluded. This procedure is expected to be launched as soon as possible (at the latest in early 2018)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2004/37/EC aims to protect workers against risks to their health and safety from exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at the workplace and lays down minimum requirements to that effect including limit values, on the basis of the available scientific and technical data. The provisions of the Directive apply to any chemical agent that meets the criteria for classification as a category 1A or 1B carcinogen set out in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP). Estimates of the recent and future burden of occupational diseases indicate that work-related cancer is a problem and will remain so in the future as a result of exposure of workers to carcinogens. Cancer is the first cause of work-related deaths in the EU. Annually, 53 % of occupational deaths are attributed to cancer, compared with 28% for circulatory diseases and 6% for respiratory diseases. Ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for over 217 million workers in the EU is a strategic goal for the Commission according to its recent Communication on the EU Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2014 ‚Äì 2020 (setting out an occupational health and safety strategy). Occupational exposure limit values set under the Directive 2004/37/EC should when appropriate be revised to take into account new scientific data, improvements in measurement techniques, risk management measures and other relevant factors. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: as regards respirable crystalline silica dust, the option maintained is the one which includes the possibility of inclusion in Annex I to the Directive together with the establishment of a limit value for respirable crystalline silica dust (respirable fraction) in Annex III. The limit values to be introduced in Annex III proposed in this initiative and agreed by the Advisory Committee on Safety and Health at work (ACSH). According to the impact assessment, this is estimated to save around 100 000 lives by 2069. As regards the impact on workers, this proposal should result in benefits in terms of preventing workers from getting avoidable work-related cancer, and thus preventing unnecessary suffering and illness. In addition, this proposal would also prevent unnecessary health costs, as follows: respirable crystalline silica dust: the proposed limit value at 0.1 mg/m3 will provide for 99,000 avoided cancer cases by 2069 for a total monetized health benefit quantified between EUR 34 and 89 billion; hardwood dust: a limit value of 3 mg/m3 will provide for a total monetized health benefit between EUR 12 and 54 million; benefits are also expected in relation to introducing an exposure limit value at 0.025 mg/m3 for all chromium (VI) compounds. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to revise the limit values in Directive 2004/37/EC on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work and to revise or to introduce exposure limit values for 13 chemical agents. More specifically, it aims to: include in Annex I to the Directive work involving exposure to respirable crystalline silica dust generated by a work process and establish a corresponding limit value in Annex III. The words ‚Äòrespirable crystalline silica dust‚Äô used in Article 1 refer to the dust particles that reach the alveoli; establish in Annex III limit values for further 10 additional carcinogens: certain chromium compounds (VI); some refractory ceramic fibers; 1,2-epoxypropane, 1,3-butadiene, 2 nitropropane; Acrylamide; Bromoethylene; Chromium VI; Ethylene oxide; Hydrazine; o-toluidine. It is appropriate to establish a limit value for hydrazine and to assign to it a notation indicating the possibility of significant dermal uptake. A skin notation assigned to a limit value identifies the possibility of significant uptake through the skin; revise the existing limit values for hardwood dusts and vinyl chloride monomer in the light of available scientific data. This proposal leaves Member States the possibility to keep or set more favourable standards for workers and the flexibility to take into account specific features in their national situation. The limit values set in this Directive will be kept under review in the light of the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, in particular to take account of the interaction between limit values set out under Directive 2004/37/EC and DNELs (Derived No Effect Levels) derived for hazardous chemicals under that Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in February 2013, the Commission tabled a package of legislative proposals on Smart Borders to modernise the Schengen area‚Äôs external border management. Since then, technical, financial and operational concerns on certain aspects of the design of the systems have been brought to light. Therefore, the Commission has decided to: revise its 2013 proposal for a Regulation for the establishment of an Entry/Exit System (EES); revise its 2013 proposal for Regulation amending the Schengen Borders Code to integrate the technical changes that result from the new proposal for a Regulation establishing an Entry/Exit System (EES); withdraw its 2013 proposal for a Regulation for a Registered Traveller Programme (RTP). CONTENT: this proposal is part of the broader 'Smart Borders Package', addressing the role of information systems in enhancing external border management, internal security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime. It seeks to modernise external border management by improving the quality and efficiency of controls and support Member States with the increasing numbers of travellers entering and exiting the EU. The main differences between this revised proposal and the 2013 proposals are as follows: Single system : only one system is proposed, the Entry Exit System. Scope of the new Entry Exit System : the scope of the new Entry Exit System includes border crossings by all third country nationals visiting the Schengen area for a short stay (maximum 90 days period in any period of 180 days), both visa-required and visa-exempt travellers, or eventually, on the basis of a touring visa (up to one year). The system will register the name, type of travel document and biometrics and the date and place of entry and exit. This will facilitate the border crossing of bona fide travellers, detect over-stayers and identify undocumented persons in the Schengen area. The EES will also record refusals of entry of third country nationals falling within its scope. Interoperability : this should be ensured between the EES and VIS in order to achieve more efficiency and rapidity at border checks. Biometric identifiers : while the 2013 EES proposals were relying on ten fingerprints, the revised EES proposals suggests a combination of four fingerprints and the facial image as biometric identifiers introduced from the start of operations of the EES. The four fingerprints are used at enrolment to check if the third country national was already registered in the system while the facial image allows for a quick and reliable (automatic) verification at subsequent entry that the individual subject to the border control is the one already registered in the EES. The Entry-Exit System will replace the current system of manual stamping of passports which is time consuming, does not provide reliable data on border crossings and does not allow the detection of over-stayers or address cases of loss or destruction of travelling documents. Data protection and data retention period : there is a significant reduction in the volume of personal data recorded in EES: 26 data items are to be recorded in EES instead of 36. Appropriate data protection safeguards and strict access rights are foreseen in accordance with EU data protection rules. The retention time for stored data is five years. This extended period shall reduce the re-enrolment frequency. The facilitation of border crossings : the approach for facilitation is based on the implementation of self-service systems and e-gates, which will allow third country nationals to initiate the procedure for border clearance, to be completed by providing additional information to the border guard on request. The use of these accelerators (introduced in the proposal amending the Schengen Borders Code) is optional for Member States, open to most of the travellers and does not require the development of any new system. In addition there will be a harmonised legal basis (again introduced in the amendments to the Schengen Borders Code) for the establishment of national Registered Travellers Programmes by Member States, on a voluntary basis. Law enforcement access : from the start of operations, Member States' law enforcement authorities and Europol will have access to the EES, under strictly defined conditions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in the 2013 proposals, EUR 1.1 billion was set aside as an indicative amount for the development of an EES and an RTP. For the revised proposal, based on the preferred option of a single EES system including the law enforcement access, the amount needed has been estimated at EUR 480 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council.

CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) 2016/399 of the European Parliament and of the Council on a Union Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). The proposed amendments are due to the proposed establishment of an Entry Exit System (EES) for which a legislative proposal is presented simultaneously. The current proposal replaces the 2013 proposal and integrates the following, inter alia, into the Schengen Borders Code: Definitions : additional definitions of the EES, self-service system, e-gate and Automated Border Control (ABC) system. Border checks on persons : the obligation to check the authenticity of all travel documents that contain an electronic storage medium using valid certificates has been added. Provisions have been laid down as regards the use of automated border control systems for EU/EEA/CH citizens and for third country nationals who hold a residence card. National facilitation programmes : the proposal foresees the possibility for each Member State to introduce national facilitation programmes on a voluntary basis. Relaxation of border checks : the obligation to always enter the data of the traveller into the EES while entering or exiting the Schengen area is highlighted. Even in situations of relaxation of border check procedures the registration in the EES shall be carried out. Fall-back solutions are proposed in case of technical impossibility to enter data in the Central System of the EES or in case of failure of the Central System of the EES. Stamping of the travel document : given that the new EES targets the abolition of stamping on entry and exit of the travel documents of third country nationals admitted for a short stay, the obligation to systematically stamp on entry and exit the travel documents of third country nationals admitted for a short stay is deleted. However, where expressly provided under national legislation, the new proposal foresees the possibility, for each Member State to stamp on entry and exit the travel document of those third country nationals holding a residence permit issued by that same Member State. Refusal of entry : the proposal foresees that data on third country nationals whose entry for a short stay [or for a stay on the basis of a touring visa] has been refused shall be registered in the EES. Territorial provisions : the proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part. Therefore, they shall not be bound by it or subject to its application."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: China is among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the Schengen area. EU citizens also need a visa to enter China. In the context of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue established in October 2013, the European Union and China agreed on a cooperation package comprising measures in the area of irregular migration and visa policy that would be negotiated or implemented in two interdependent phases: On 14 September 2015 the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China for a short-stay visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports and addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations were opened on 21 September. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators of the EU and China respectively on 3 and 4 November 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports. The main provisions of the proposal may be summarised as follows: Purpose and scope: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for citizens of the European Union holding a valid diplomatic passport or an EU laissez-passer and for citizens of China holding a valid diplomatic passport when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that China may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom and Ireland are therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application. Duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as these Member States ((currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania) are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the Chinese holders of diplomatic passports to stay for 90 days in any 180-day period on the territory of each of those Member States, independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Visits by high officials: the agreement stipulates that officials at or above vice-ministerial level of the central government and officers of or above the rank of major general of the armed forces must inform the competent authorities of the country to be visited through diplomatic channels before they travel to its territory for official purposes. Exchange of specimens: the agreement provides for the exchange of specimens of diplomatic passports and the EU laissez-passer no later than 90 days after the date of signature of the agreement. Territorial application: the agreement clarifies that the visa waiver for Chinese holders of diplomatic passports only applies to the European territories of France and the Netherlands. Joint declarations: a joint declaration on the interpretation of the period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. In addition to the joint declaration, two other joint declarations are attached to the agreement regarding: The agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the agreement whose tasks include, among others, the monitoring of its implementation as well as suggesting amendments or additions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the sustained financial and economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources, as Member States are reducing their budgets. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of ESIF programmes is of particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the economy. Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that on the request of a Member State with temporary budgetary difficulties, i.e. those countries which have received financial assistance under an adjustment programme after 21 December 2013, interim payments may be increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate applicable to each priority for the ERDF, ESF, and the Cohesion Fund or to each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF, provided the Member State submits a corresponding request. This provision currently applies until 30 June 2016. Article 120(3) of the same Regulation provides that from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2017, the maximum co-financing rate at the level of each priority for all operational programmes supported by the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus shall be 85 % instead of 50 % applicable to more developed regions. The Regulation requires the Commission to review these two financial provisions and make, if necessary, a legislative proposal before 30 June 2016 with a view to their possible extension. The Five countries were eligible for the 10% top-up on interim payments submitted before 30 June 2016. Since then the financial assistance programmes for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Romania have expired. This means that Greece is the only country under an adjustment programme on 30 June 2016. Cyprus exited its adjustment programme at the end of March 2016. However, the economic situation of Cyprus is still fragile as reflected by its sluggish growth rate, declining investment, high unemployment and stressed financial sector. CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties continue implementing the ESIF programmes and disburse funds to projects, the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 would allow the Commission to: top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016 (currently Greece). It would cover the period until 30 June of the year following the calendar year in which the Member State stops receiving financial assistance. This approach is in line with the ESI Funds accounting year which covers the period from 1 July to 30 June. It would extend the period of eligibility up to maximum 18 months; extend the exceptional cofinancing rate of 85 % for the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until programme closure with a view to easing the pressure on the national budget and accelerating much-needed investments. The total financial allocation for the period from the Funds to the countries and the programmes in question will not change. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of ESIF financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2014-2020. For payment appropriations, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. Based on the payment forecast from Member States revised by the Commission and the payment appropriations included in the 2016 budget and in the 2017 Draft Budget, the need for payment appropriations are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 544 million. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal may imply a temporary increase of payment appropriations, which would be compensated by lower payments at the end of the life cycle of the 2014-2020 programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters seeks to simplify the method of transmission of judicial and extrajudicial documents between the Contracting States. It thus facilitates judicial cooperation in cross-border civil and commercial litigation. The EU in its external relations has been promoting the accession of third countries to the Hague Service Convention. The Hague Service Convention is not open to participation by regional organisations. As a result, the European Union is not in a position to accede to the Convention. Given that the Hague Service Convention is important for the European Union interests, the Council should authorise the Member States which had not concluded the Hague Service Convention before adoption of the Union measures to accede to the Convention in the interest of the European Union, subject to certain conditions. The Member States to which this decision is addressed are Austria and Malta. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2) and 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal for a Council Decision, Austria and Malta would accede to the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters in the interest of the European Union. Purpose of the Convention: the Convention indicates the channels to be used for the transmission from one Contracting State to another in the event of service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial act. The main channel of transmission, in lieu of consular and diplomatic channels, is through a Central Authority, who shall serve the documents or shall arrange to have them served. The Convention also provides for several other modes of transmission (for example, by post). It seeks to establish a system which, as far as possible, brings actual notice of the document to be served to the recipient in sufficient time to enable him to defend himself. Lastly, the Convention facilitates proof that the service has been affected abroad, by means of certificates contained in a uniform model. EU competences: this field falls into the exclusive external competence of the European Union, because of the adoption of internal Union legislation by means of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. As a result, Member States cannot sign this Convention without being authorised to do so. 24 Member States were Parties to the Convention before the EU legislation was adopted. Austria and Malta remain to be authorised to accede to the Convention. The Commission therefore proposes that the Council authorises Austria and Malta to accede to the Convention in the interest of the European Union. The Convention does not contain any provisions allowing the European Union itself to accede to the Convention. Declarations of the Contracting States: the Convention provides for a possibility for the Contracting States to make declarations with regard to a number of its provisions. The EU Member States, Contracting States to the Convention, entered various declarations. The situation is not uniform, however. Against this backdrop, it is not reasonable to require the Member States concerned to make uniform declaration(s), if any. In conclusion, Austria and Malta should, when acceding to the Convention, make all appropriate declarations allowed under its provisions that they deem necessary. The text of such declarations should be attached to the Council decision. Entry into force: Austria and Malta will take the necessary measures to deposit their instruments of accession before 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the European Union‚Äôs budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since early 2011, the Jordanian economy has been significantly affected by the ongoing regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Combined with a weaker global environment, this regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. The Syrian conflict has impacted Jordan not only by disrupting trade with and through Syria but also by causing an inflow of around 1.3 million of Syrian refugees into Jordan that has increased pressure on Jordan's fiscal position, public services and infrastructure. In 2012, Jordan and the IMF agreed on a first adjustment programme, which was supported by a three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 2 billion. This programme was successfully completed in August 2015. The IMF programme was complemented by a first Macro-Financial Assistance from the European Union (the EU) in the amount of EUR 180 million (MFA-I), which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2013 and was disbursed in two tranches of EUR 100 million and EUR 80 million in February 2015 and in October 2015, respectively. While the country made progress with macroeconomic stabilisation and reform under the first programme supported by the IMF, the EU and other donors, the persistence of the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq continued to disrupt Jordan's foreign trade and undermine investor and tourist confidence, with the economic situation deteriorating again in 2015. In this context, the Jordanian government has called for increased support from the international community to address the economic consequences of the Syrian crisis, and in particular the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees in Jordan. At the conference 'Supporting Syria and the Region', held in London on 4 February 2016, the international community pledged about USD 10 billion to help the countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Of this amount, the EU pledged EUR 2.39 billion for the countries affected by the Syrian refugee crisis including a EUR 200 million loan for the purpose of a second Macro-Financial Assistance operation for Jordan (MFA-II). This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Jordan for a total maximum amount of EUR 200 million, provided in the form of a medium-term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2016-2017, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments of EUR 100 million each. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place towards the end of 2016. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second quarter of 2017. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable? The loans shall have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Conditions granting assistance : the Union's macro-financial assistance should support Jordan's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the respect for human rights. Disbursements : the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. The Commission and the Jordanian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding aiming to improve the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth. These reform measures would support the authorities‚Äô reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other donors, as well as the policy programmes associated with the EU‚Äôs budgetary support operations. They would be consistent with the economic reform priorities agreed between the EU and Jordan in the context of the Single Support Framework for 2014-2017 and other strategic documents (including the future Partnership Priorities and the Jordan Compact). They would also build upon the structural reforms implemented under MFA-I. Availability of assistance : the proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used in this context. Follow-up and reporting : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and would be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning of the EU's Guarantee Fund for external actions, at a rate of 9 % of the amounts disbursed, from budget line 01 03 06 (""Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) will be made in 2016 and the second loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) in 2017 in accordance with the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-19 budgets. Based on current projections on the utilisation of the budget line 01 03 06, the Commission assesses that the budgetary impact of the operation can be accommodated."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: European society is ageing. Pension systems across the European Union (EU) have to adapt in order to ensure adequate, safe and sustainable pensions. The institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs) sector is being developed in many Member States where occupational pensions so far play a limited role, including by setting up regulatory frameworks. Failing to provide an up-to-date EU regulatory framework now entails the risk that Member States continue to develop diverging solutions, thereby exacerbating regulatory fragmentation. Furthermore, improvements to the performance of occupational pensions require long periods of time to materialise. According to the Commission, a revision of Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision is necessary for the following reasons: (1) protect members and beneficiaries, and facilitate safe cross-border provisioning through higher governance standards reflecting best practices at national level following the economic and financial crisis; (2) reduce the obstacles to develop cross border occupational pensions markets, which would help companies, including SMEs and multinationals, to organise their pension provision on a European scale more efficiently; (3) there is evidence of significant gaps in the level of information provided to scheme members and beneficiaries across the EU. This proposal builds on a number of initiatives launched in recent years such as the White Paper on pensions and the Green Paper on long-term financing of the European economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment report that considers a range of policy options and sub-options. The report was first submitted to the Impact Assessment Board on 4 September 2013. The Board asked for resubmission with additional information on the views of the different stakeholder groups, problem definition, subsidiarity and proportionality aspects, options and expected impacts. The impact assessment was resubmitted on 16 October 2013. On 6 November the Board stated it could not issue a positive opinion and requested some further amendments. CONTENT: this proposal to recast Directive 2003/41/EC has four specific objectives: 1. Removing remaining prudential barriers for cross-border IORPs , notably by: requiring that the rules on investment and disclosure of information to members and beneficiaries are those of the home Member State, clarifying procedures for cross-border activities, clearly defining the scope of action of home and host Member State. 2. Ensuring good governance and risk management : the proposal: (i) establishes that institutions need to have in place an effective system of governance which provides for sound and prudent management of their activities; (ii) sets out that institutions must have a sound remuneration policy; (iii) provides for an effective internal audit function which evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system; (iv) sets out that IORPs need to appoint a single depositary for safekeeping of assets and oversight duties if members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk. 3. Providing clear and relevant information to members and beneficiaries : the proposal places an obligation on IORPs to provide, every twelve months, a pension benefit statement (‚ÄòPBS‚Äô) for the individual in the clearest possible way, also as a basis to feed information into a potential pension tracking service. 4. Ensuring that supervisors have the necessary tools to effectively supervise IORPs : the proposal lays down that the competent authority of the home Member State has the sole responsibility for the prudential supervision of all IORPs authorised or registered in its jurisdiction. It establishes the principle that supervision of IORPs needs to be prospective and risk-based, as well as timely and proportionate. In addition, the proposal introduces the supervisory review process which aims to identify IORPs with financial, organisational or other features susceptible to producing a higher risk profile. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications relate to tasks allocated to European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). No new resources will be needed. Operation appropriations which are necessary for the implementation of this initiative will be covered by redeployment within the contribution granted to EIOPA during the annual budgetary procedure, in accordance with the financial programming set by the Communication from the Commission ""Programming of human and financial resources for decentralised agencies 2014-2020"". The estimated impact on expenditure is EUR 2.035 million for the period 2015-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBF) throughout its distribution. The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin tuna entered into force on 20 May 1994. The European Union has been a Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission since 2006. Cooperating Non-Members participate fully in the activities of the CCSBT but are not entitled to vote. On 1 December 2009, the Council authorised the European Commission to seek, on behalf of the European Union, an amendment to the rules of Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in order for the European Union to become a Contracting Party. During its 20th meeting in October 2013, the CCSBT amended the Resolution governing the Extended Commission to allow the European Union to become a Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission through Exchange of Letters. Since vessels flying the flags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution of Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the Union's interest to play an effective role in the implementation of the Convention. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to conclude the legal process launched with the signature and provisional application of the Exchange of Letters to obtain membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee after having obtained the consent from the European Parliament. Upon completion of this procedure, the EU would be entitled to membership and vote in the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/92/EC regulates the point of sale of insurance products so as to ensure the rights of the consumer. The Directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument containing high level principles and has been implemented in the 27 Member States in substantially different ways. The need to review IMD1 was already acknowledged during the implementation check carried out by the Commission in 2005-2008. During the discussions in the European Parliament on Directive 2009/138/EC on the risk-based approach to capitalisation and supervision of insurance undertakings (Solvency II), a specific request was furthermore made to review IMD1. Some Members of the Parliament and some consumer organisations considered that there was a need for improved policyholder protection in the aftermath of the financial crisis and that selling practices for different insurance products could be improved. In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency, the European Parliament requested that the revision of IMD1 should take into account the ongoing revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). In November 2010, the G20 asked the OECD, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other relevant international organisations to develop common principles in the field of financial services in order to strengthen consumer protection. The current review of IMD1 should be seen in the light of these guidelines and related international initiatives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options discussed in the impact assessment were assessed against different criteria: (i) market integration for market players; (ii) customer protection and confidence; (iii) a level playing field for various market players, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the estimate of the administrative burden on the basis of an external study and industry statistics is that in view of the large number of undertakings affected (about 1 million), the proposal will result in a relatively moderate cost of, on average, about EUR 730 per undertaking. The impact assessment work finished in 2012. The European Commission Impact Assessment Board's recommendations were taken on board especially concerning the impact on SME's. In general, proportional requirements have been introduced to take account of SME's concerns and to respect the principle 'less complex products, less rules'. These intermediaries will be subject to a light touch regime. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a recast directive seeks to improve regulation in the retail insurance market in an efficient manner. It aims at ensuring a level playing field between all participants involved in the selling of insurance products and at strengthening policyholder protection. Most of the issues dealt with by the revision are already covered by the current IMD1 legal framework. In concrete terms, the IMD2 project should achieve the following improvements: ¬∑  expand the scope of application of IMD1 to all distribution channels (e.g. direct writers, car rentals, etc.). The draft directive brings within its scope certain ancillary sellers and after-sales businesses such as loss adjusters and claims handlers; ¬∑  clarify the exercise of the freedom of establishment , of the freedom to provide services, and the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard; ¬∑  identify, manage and mitigate conflicts of interest; ¬∑  raise the level of harmonisation of administrative sanctions and measures for breach of key provisions of the current Directive; ¬∑  enhance the suitability and objectiveness of advice to consumers; ¬∑  ensure sellers' professional qualifications match the complexity of products sold; ¬∑  simplify and approximate the procedure for cross-border entry to insurance markets across the EU. The proposal differentiates between the different selling channels for insurance products and imposes less burdensome registration and professional qualification requirements on those selling simple insurance products. For example, the sellers of ancillary insurance products of low risk, such as car rentals and travel agents are subject to a simplified declaration procedure instead of registration as insurance intermediaries. The proposal also differentiates between the life insurance products and the general insurance products in respect of the remuneration transparency requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) should play a key role in the implementation of the new EU-wide framework and be granted specific competences in this regard. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to tasks allocated to EIOPA. The total operational expenditure (in commitment appropriations) amounts to EUR 0.844 millions for the period 2014-2016. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the post-2020 multiannual financial framework, the Commission intends to propose a new tool to support Member States in the implementation of the structural reforms adopted in the framework of the European Semester. This tool shall have its own budgetary endowment, separate from and in addition to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI). This new reform delivery tool shall seek to support a broad range of reforms such as in product and labour markets, tax reforms, the development of capital markets, reforms to improve the business environment as well as investment in human capital and public administration reforms. The Commission intends to test the main features of this reform delivery tool in a pilot phase for the period 2018-2020, by offering the possibility to Member States to use all or part of the performance reserve in the current European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds to support reforms instead of specific projects. To this end, the Commission proposes amendments to the Regulation (EU) 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI funds). CONTENT: the proposal opens the possibility to partially or fully allocate the performance reserve set up by Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to support the reform commitments undertaken by the Members States. A Member State which opts for a partial or full allocation of the performance reserve shall propose to the Commission a detailed set of measures appropriate for the implementation of structural reforms in accordance with Union law. This proposal shall include reform commitments which shall contain milestones and targets for the implementation of the reform measures and a timetable which shall not be longer than three years. The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act , setting out the reform commitments to be implemented by the Member State and the amount allocated from the performance reserve for their support. Support to structural reforms by Member States shall take the form of a financing not linked to cost shall be managed in line with the rules for direct management set out in that Regulation, and shall not require national co-financing. The amount allocated to the implementation of the structural reforms should be proportionate to the nature and importance of the reform and should complement existing Union support to national reforms The Member State shall regularly report within the mechanisms of the European Semester on the progress in the achievement of the reform commitment."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2016, the Commission carried out a comprehensive evaluation of SIS, three years after the entry into operation of its second generation. This evaluation showed that SIS has been a genuine operational success. Nonetheless, the effectiveness and efficiency of the system should be further strengthened. To this end, the Commission is presenting a first set of three proposals to improve and extend the use of SIS as result of the evaluation while continuing its work to make existing and future law enforcement and border management systems more interoperable. These proposals cover the use of the system for: border management , police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and the return of illegally staying third country nationals. CONTENT: the present proposal and the supplementary proposal on the use of the SIS for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters lay down rules covering the comprehensive end-to-end use of SIS, including the Central SIS managed by eu-LISA Agency, but also the needs of the end-user. End-to-end use of SIS : with over 2 million end-users in the competent authorities across Europe, SIS is an extremely widely used and effective tool for information exchange. This proposal as well as the parallel proposals include rules covering the complete end-to-end operation of the system, including Central SIS operated by eu-LISA, the national systems and the end-user applications. It addresses not only the central and national systems themselves, but also the end-users' technical and operational needs. In order to use SIS to its full effectiveness Member States should ensure that each time their end-users are entitled to carry out a search in a national police or immigration database, they also search SIS in parallel. This way SIS can fulfil its objective as the main compensatory measure in the area without internal border controls and Member States can better address the cross-border dimension of criminality and the mobility of criminals. Data quality : the proposal maintains the principle that the Member State, which is the data owner, is also responsible for the accuracy of the data entered in SIS. It is, however, necessary to provide for a central mechanism managed by eu-LISA which allows Member States to regularly review those alerts in which the mandatory data fields may raise quality concerns. The proposal empowers eu-LISA to produce data quality reports to Member States at regular intervals. Photographs, facial images, dactylographic data and DNA profiles : the possibility to search with fingerprints with a view to identify a person is already set out in existing Regulation. Two new proposals make this search mandatory if the identity of the person cannot be ascertained in any other way. Currently, facial images can only be used to confirm a person's identity following an alphanumeric search, rather than as the basis for a search. Furthermore, changes make provision for facial images, photographs and palm prints to be used to search the system and identify people, when this becomes technically possible. Dactylography refers to the scientific study of fingerprints as a method of identification. Palm prints can be used to establish a person's identity in the same way that fingerprints can be used. The use of facial images for identification will ensure greater consistency between SIS and the proposed EU Entry Exit System, electronic gates and self-service kiosks. This functionality will be limited to the regular border crossing points. Access by authorities to SIS ‚Äì institutional users : this section is intended to describe the new elements in access rights with regard to EU Agencies (institutional users). Appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure that the data in the system is properly protected (including the provisions requiring that these bodies may only access the data they need to carry out their tasks). The access rights of competent national authorities have not been amended. Refusal of entry and stay : currently, a Member State may insert an alert in SIS in respect of persons subject to an entry ban based on a failure to comply with national migration legislation. With the new proposal, it shall be required that an alert be entered in SIS in any case in which an entry ban has been issued to an illegally staying third country national (this provision is inserted in order to avoid that entry bans are visible in SIS while the third-country national concerned is still present on the EU territory). This proposal is closely linked with the Commission proposal concerning the use of SIS for the return of illegally staying third country nationals. In order to allow entering such alerts it was necessary to require the minimum data necessary for the identification of the person, namely surname and date of birth which was not obligatory in the former legislation. Data protection and security : the proposal clarifies responsibility for preventing, reporting and responding to incidents that might affect the security or integrity of SIS infrastructure, SIS data or supplementary information. It provides that the Commission remains responsible for the contractual management of the SIS communication infrastructure, including tasks which will be transferred to eu-LISA. Categories of data and data processing : in order to provide more and more precise information to the end-users to facilitate and accelerate the required action as well as to allow the better identification of the alert subject this proposal expands the types of information that can be held about people for whom an alert has been issued. The proposal also expands the list of personal data that may be entered and processed in SIS for the purpose of dealing with misused identities as more data facilitates the victim and the perpetrator of misused identity. The extension of this provision entails no risk as all these data can only be entered upon the consent of the victim of misused identity. This will now also include: facial images; palm prints; details of identity documents; the victim's address; the names of the victim's father and mother. The proposal sets out the rights for data subjects to access data, rectify inaccurate data and erase unlawfully stored data. Lastly, provisions are laid down as regards statistics on the use of the SIS. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the estimated cost is EUR 64.3 million from 2018-2020."

Furthermore, changes make provision for facial images, photographs and palm prints to be used to search the system and identify people, when this becomes technically possible. Dactylography refers to the scientific study of fingerprints as a method of identification. Palm prints can be used to establish a person's identity in the same way that fingerprints can be used. In cases where fingerprints or palm prints are not available, the proposal allows for the use of DNA profiles for missing persons who need to be placed under protection, especially children. This functionality will be used only in the absence of fingerprints and will be accessible only to authorised users. The proposed changes will also allow SIS alerts to be issued for unknown persons wanted in connection with a crime, based on fingerprints or palm prints. This new alert category complements the Pr√ºm provisions that enable interconnectivity of national criminal fingerprint identification systems. Via the Pr√ºm mechanism, a Member State can launch a request to ascertain if the perpetrator of a crime whose fingerprints have been found is known in any other Member State (usually for investigative purposes). A person can be identified via the Pr√ºm mechanism only if he or she has been fingerprinted in another Member State for criminal purposes. Hence, first time offenders cannot be identified. Under this proposal, the storage of fingerprints of unknown wanted persons, will enable the fingerprints of an unknown perpetrator to be uploaded into SIS so that he or she can be identified as wanted if encountered in another Member State. It should be noted that the use of this functionality presupposes that the Member States conducted a prior consultation of all available national and international sources but could not ascertain the identity of the person concerned. Access to SIS by immigration authorities ‚Äì institutional users : users such as Europol, Eurojust and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency shall have access to SIS and SIS data that they need. Appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure that the data in the system is properly protected requiring that these bodies may only access the data they need to carry out their tasks. Provisions are also laid down enabling immigration authorities to access SIS. Suspension of certain alerts : the proposal provides for Member States to temporarily suspend alerts for arrest (in case of an ongoing police operation or investigation), making them visible only to SIRENE Bureaux but not to the officers on the ground for a limited period of time. This provision helps to avoid that a confidential police operation to arrest a highly wanted offender is jeopardised by a police officer who is not involved in the matter. Provisions are laid down for alerts on missing persons. Changes to these allow preventive alerts to be issued in cases where parental abduction is deemed a high risk, and provide for more finely tuned categorisation of missing persons alerts. These changes will mean that, where there is a high risk of imminent parental abduction, border guards and law enforcement officials are made aware of the risk and will be able to examine more closely the circumstances where an at-risk child is travelling, taking the child into protective custody if required. This alert will require an appropriate decision of the judicial authorities granting custody only to one of the parents. Inquiry check : the proposal introduces a new form of check, the 'inquiry check'. This is, in particular, intended to support measures to counter terrorism and serious crime. It allows authorities to stop and question the person concerned. It is more in-depth than the existing discreet check, but does not involve searching the person and does not amount to arresting him or her. It may, however, provide sufficient information to decide on further action to be taken. An expanded list of objects is set out for which alerts can be issued, adding falsified documents, falsified banknotes, IT equipment, component parts of vehicles, etc. Data protection and security : the proposal clarifies responsibility for preventing, reporting and responding to incidents that might affect the security or integrity of SIS infrastructure, SIS data or supplementary information. It provides that the Commission remains responsible for the contractual management of the SIS communication infrastructure, including tasks which will be transferred to eu-LISA. Categories of data and data processing : in order to provide more and more precise information to the end-users to facilitate and accelerate the required action as well as to allow the better identification of the alert subject, this proposal expands the types of information that can be held about people for whom an alert has been issued.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2016, the Commission carried out a comprehensive evaluation of SIS, three years after the entry into operation of its second generation.

These proposals cover the use of the system for: border management, police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and the return of illegally staying third country nationals . CONTENT: this proposal lays down the conditions and procedures for the entry and processing in the Schengen Information System (SIS) of alerts in respect of third-country nationals subject to return decisions issued by the Member States in accordance with procedures respecting Directive 2008/115/EC, as well as for exchanging supplementary information on such alerts. Purpose : the purpose of the present proposal is to improve and extend the use of SIS by making it obligatory for Member States' authorities to enter in SIS all return decisions issued, to allow their EU-wide visibility and thus enhance their enforcement. The use of SIS for return is aimed at assisting immigration authorities in following up and enforcing the return of third-country nationals who have no right to stay in the Member States. It also helps to prevent and deter irregular migration and to enhance information sharing and cooperation between immigration authorities. Entering alerts on return : in order to facilitate the exchange of information between competent authorities, the proposal lays down the purpose and rules for entering alerts on return in SIS to allow the competent authorities to verify that the obligation to return has been complied with. The alert should be without delay entered as soon as the decision has been issued to the illegally staying third-country national concerned, in order to allow the verification referred to above. The alert should indicate if a period for voluntary departure is still running or if a decision has been suspended or removal has been postponed. Where there are no reasons to believe that it would undermine the purpose of return procedures, voluntary return should be preferred over forced return and a period for voluntary departure should be granted to the returnee. The duration of the period for voluntary departure, and any prolongation thereof, should be indicated in the alert to allow public authorities to decide whether it is appropriate to take action in the individual case. Exchange of information between the competent authorities : the proposal lays down ca tegories of data that can be contained in a return alert. Effective and timely cooperation and exchange of supplementary information between Member States requires the set-up of single point of contact. To improve the efficiency of the EU's return policy, Member States shall be obliged to confirm the departure of the third-country national subject to an alert on return to the Member State (or authority) that entered the alert. This provision shall allow the authorities issuing and enforcing return decisions to verify that the obligation to return has been complied with. Non-compliance with an obligation to return : the proposal sets out the provisions in cases of non-compliance with the obligation to return. A series of procedures are provided to deal with situations where a third-country national subject to an alert on return is identified and apprehended in another Member State (passing back the third-country national to the issuing Member State). Access and management of data : provisions are provided regarding: alerts on return need to be deleted following the return of the third-country national concerned; the opportunity to keep trace in SIS of return decisions after the return was enforced will be explored. This information could be useful if a third country national re-entered the territory of the Member States and is found as illegally staying in a different Member State than the one who issued the first return decision; enabling the authorities responsible for issuing return decisions to be able to access SIS in order to enter, update, delete and search data (the authorities concerned are listed in the proposal). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the cost-estimate of EUR 3.6 million from 2018 to 2020 includes costs for the technical upgrade of SIS for the purpose of return."

The signature of the agreement is foreseen for the first half of 2006. Due to the advance status of the relationship between Morocco and the European Union, the Morocco agreement will result in the seamless integration of the Moroccan transport market into the single European market through a two-stage approach, always based on the three pillars of the aviation external policy: regulatory convergence (integration of the EC aviation regulations, participation in the Single European Sky) assorted with targeted technical assistance (through instruments such as the PAST), leading to the highest possible degree of market opening. This would result in an unrestricted commercial environment where operators are free to take commercial decisions, and where they operate under the highest standards in the areas of aviation safety, aviation security, environmental and consumer protection."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: new psychoactive substances can pose serious cross border threats to health which makes necessary to enhance monitoring, early warning and combating of those threats. In 2015, 100 new substances were reported for the first time to the EU Early Warning System (EWS), bringing the total number of new substances monitored to more than 560 ‚Äì with more than 380 (70%) of these detected in the last five years alone. On 17 September 2013, the Commission put forward a package of two legislative proposals on new psychoactive substances: (i) a proposal for a Regulation on new psychoactive substances and; (ii) a proposed Directive amending Council Framework Decision 2004/757/JHA laying down minimum provisions on the constituent elements of criminal acts and penalties in the field of illicit drug trafficking, as regards the definition of drug. Inter-institutional negotiations of this legislative package have been ongoing for more than two years . The European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on 17 April 2014. The Council did not adopt a general approach on the proposals; during the examination of the proposals Member States expressed doubts concerning the choice of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) as the legal basis for the proposed Regulation. In response to the agreement by COREPER on 6 April 2016 on a compromise approach proposed by the Netherlands Presidency of the Council to achieve the same objective of a swifter, more effective EU action on NPS, the Commission proposes targeted amendments of Regulation 1920/2006 integrating the draft provisions on early warning system and risk assessment procedure that were part of the 2013 Commission proposal for a Regulation on new psychoactive substances into the founding Regulation of the EMCDDA. The proposal reflects the priorities set out by the European Agenda on Security adopted on 28 April 2015. CONTENT: this proposal - based on Article 168(5) TFEU - seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 1920/2006 in order to strengthen the EU early warning system and the risk assessment and streamline procedures to ensure more effective and fast action. In order to speed up the process, deadlines are substantially shortened compared to the current system based on Council Decision 2005/387/JHA. For the purpose of swift and effective collection of information on NPS, the EMCDDA should conclude working arrangements with Europol, the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority without undue delay following the publication of the Regulation in the Official Journal. This proposal also ensures a participation of EUROPOL in the early warning system and risk assessment procedure, in particular as input on the involvement of criminal groups in the manufacture and distribution of new psychoactive substances is concerned. According to Article 23 of Regulation 1920/2006 the Commission may propose, if appropriate, and in the light of developments in respect of regulatory agencies on the basis of the next evaluation of the Centre further amendments to the EMCDDA founding Regulation The following amendments to Regulation 1920/2006 seek to: clarify that tasks of the EMCDDA are information exchange and early warning on new psychoactive substances as well as risk assessment. The Centre also monitors all new psychoactive substances that have been reported by Member States; establish the respective roles of Member States, the EMCDDA and Europol in the process of exchange of information and early warning on new psychoactive substances; lay down the contents and the procedures for the drawing up and the transmission by the EMCDDA of an initial report on a new psychoactive substance. Europol, the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Food Safety Authority are associated to the collection of information for an initial report; empower the Commission to request the EMCDDA to assess the risks of a new psychoactive substance on which an initial report has been drawn up. The proposal lays down the procedures for the risk assessment, which is to be conducted by the Scientific Committee of the EMCDDA, and for the drawing up and the transmission of a risk assessment report; detail circumstances in which no risk assessment is to be conducted on a new psychoactive substance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the subsidy for the Centre forms already part of the Union's budget. However, for the Centre to adequately deal with the growing number of requests related to information exchange on new psychoactive substances as well as with the proposed streamlined procedures for the EU early warning system and risk assessment procedure, an amount of EUR 676 000 in total for the period 2017-2020 for the system development and an amount of EUR 100 000 per year to finance three additional contract agents will need to be added to the Centre's budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in principle, the details of the implementation of the landing obligation are to be defined in regional multi-annual management plans adopted through codecision. Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, in the absence of multiannual plans or management plans, the Commission may adopt discard plans on a temporary basis and for a period of no more than three years. Experience has demonstrated that the preparation and adoption of multiannual or management plans that include discard plans takes longer than was envisaged at the time of the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The first Commission delegated regulations establishing discard plans entered into force on the 1 January 2015 and are expiring at the end of 2017. To date, only the Baltic multiannual plan is in place, whereas two Commission proposals for a multiannual plan for demersals in the North Sea and for small pelagics in the Adriatic are currently under negotiation between the co-legislators. It is therefore appropriate to set the period for which the Commission may adopt discard plans in the absence of multiannual or management plans. CONTENT: the proposal contains only one substantive provision, which amends Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 in order to temporarily extend the Commission's power to adopt discard plans by means of delegated acts for an additional period of three years, provided that there are no multi-annual plans in place for the sea basins concerned."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EU) No 216/2013 provides that the electronic edition of the Official Journal shall bear an advanced electronic signature based on a qualified certificate and created with a secure-signature-creation device, in accordance with Directive 1999/93/EC. In addition to the electronic signature and the advanced electronic signature already provided for in Directive 1999/93 (repealed with effect from 1 July 2016), Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 introduced the possibility of authenticating a document with an electronic seal or an advanced electronic seal based on an electronic seal certificate. Since authentication by an electronic seal rather than an electronic signature is not merely a different electronic system but makes an actual difference in legal terms (in the case of a signature, the authentication method is based on the involvement of a specific natural person; where a seal is used, it is created by the legal person with no indication of who, within the legal person, was responsible for authenticating the document), Regulation No 216/2013 should be amended accordingly. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation No 216/2013 to allow the Official Journal to be authenticated by an advanced electronic seal based on a qualified certificate in accordance with Regulation 910/2014. The Commission considers that the use of the advanced electronic seal will make it possible to automate electronic signatures and accelerate the procedure for publication on EUR-Lex. The signature will no longer be that of a named official but a recognised body of the European Union, i.e. the Publications Office. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the human resources required will be met by staff from the DG who are already assigned to management of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if necessary with any additional allocation which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual allocation procedure and in the light of budgetary constraints."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the common and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Fund). This Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/2305 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the resources allocated for economic, social and territorial cohesion. The general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2018 amended the financial programming for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices and bringing the overall amount of commitment appropriations for the YEI for 2018 up to EUR 350 million in current prices. The amount of commitment appropriations for 2020 needs to be adjusted downwards accordingly to reflect the frontloading to 2018. CONTENT: this proposal is the result of the 2018 budgetary decision. It aims to adapt the amounts of resources available for the investment for growth and jobs goal and for the European territorial cooperation goal set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations reflected in Annex VI in order to reflect changes in the financial programming for the YEI. Under this amending proposal, the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for the budgetary commitments for the period 2014-2020 (expressed in 2011 prices), shall amount to EUR 329 982 345 366, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in Annex VI, of which: EUR 325 938 694 233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; EUR 4 043 651 133 represents a specific allocation for the YEI . It is also proposed to correct some errors with regard to the amounts and percentages concerning the resources for the investment for growth and jobs goal set out in Regulation (EU) 2017/2305, amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. Under the corrective measure, the resources earmarked for the investment for growth and employment goal would amount to 96.09 % of total resources (i.e. a total of EUR 317 073 545 392) and shall be distributed as follows: 51.52 % (a total of EUR 163 359 380 738) for less developed regions; 10.82 % (a total of EUR 34 319 221 039) for transition regions; 16.33 % (a total of EUR 51 773 321 432) for more developed regions; 20.89 % (a total of EUR 66 236 030 665) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund; 0.44 % (a total of EUR 1 385 591 518) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The European Union and Ukraine negotiated in 2007-2011 an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed by both parties on 27 June 2014. The European Union and Ukraine are to establish a free trade area over a transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from the entry into force of the Association Agreement. Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine was to apply until Title IV of the Association Agreement enters into force or is applied provisionally. It was intended that this Regulation (would cease to apply on 1 November 2014 at the latest. In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges faced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was decided to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule of concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine by means of the autonomous trade preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014. In view of the challenges Ukraine still faces, the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 shall be extended. CONTENT: in order to support the political and economic stability of Ukraine, the European Commission would propose the extension of the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31 December 2015. For the purpose of predictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas should following the extension remain the same as for 2014. The autonomous trade preferences provided for by Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 should have full respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law, promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence, as well as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proposal ensures that it is appropriate to introduce the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine. BUDGETARYIMPLICATION: the European Union will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to EUR 487 million (gross) annually. However, those figures are estimates, having regard to the political and economic situation of Ukraine and can change."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is to ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. The Union is Party to the ICCAT, the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas to which the Union is a Contracting Party. The ICCAT has the authority to adopt decisions (‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù) for fisheries conservation and management in its area of competence; these acts are binding. Certain ICCAT BFT measures were transposed through Regulation (EU) No 544/2014 which amended Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009. The purpose of that amendment was to transpose the measures on fishing seasons adopted by ICCAT in 2012 and 2013. With a view to ensure uniform and effective application throughout the European Union of all measures of the Recovery plan adopted between 2012 and 2014, the current proposal will incorporate them into a Regulation concerning a multiannual recovery plan for BFT in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. This Regulation will repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009. CONTENT: the objective of the proposed Regulation, in line with the Recovery plan, is to achieve a biomass corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield by 2022 with at least 60% probability. The proposal aims at transposing into Union law measures of the multiannual Bluefin Tuna (BFT) recovery plan in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) at its annual meetings between 2012 and 2014. It contains technical measures such as those on transfer and caging operations of live BFT, including also measures on the use of stereoscopic cameras to estimate the quantities of BFT and releases, catch reporting requirements, and the implementation of the ICCAT Regional Observer Programme. The new Regulation on the CFP introduced a landing obligation which applies as of 1 January 2015 to Bluefin tuna. Under that Regulation, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, for the purpose of implementing such international obligations into Union law, including, in particular, derogations from the landing obligation. Accordingly, the discard of bluefin tuna will be allowed in some situations laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2015/98. This Regulation does therefore not need to cover such discard obligations. DELEGATED ACT: the proposal contains provisions to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002, the Union and its Member States committed themselves to act against the continued decline of many fish stocks. Cod, herring and sprat are the subject of important fisheries in the Baltic Sea. They are also important components of the Baltic ecosystem and there are also strong biological interactions between them. Scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ('ICES') has indicated that the current exploitation rates for some of these stocks are not consistent with achieving maximum sustainable yield. A management plan for the Baltic Sea cod stocks has been in place since 2007 but the stocks of herring and sprat are not yet subject to a management plan. This hinders the sustainable management of these fisheries, and does not provide stability of fishing opportunities for the fishermen operating in these fisheries. In addition, Member States and stakeholders have expressed support for the development and implementation of management plans for the key Baltic stocks. In order to increase predictability for fishermen and to ensure high, stable and sustainable catches , the proposal is the first multiannual plan adopted in accordance with the new Common Fisheries Policy which entered into force in January 2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three options were analysed from biological, environmental and economic-social aspects. The option with most beneficial impact has been then developed into the present multiannual plan: to ensure sustainable fisheries at MSY level by 2015 for the stocks concerned is to achieve biological and environmental benefits. The probable reduction in the overall amount of fishing would also imply a reduction in emissions from vessel engines; as for the economic-social impact , bringing the herring and sprat stocks under a management plan would provide a systematic basis for setting annual TACs in a way which would provide the pelagic sector with predictability of catches which would help support business planning and stability of supply; the abolishment of fishing effort system and of requirement of single area fishing will simplify the legal framework and reduce administrative burden on Member State and industry. CONTENT: the Commission proposes, in the framework of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a multiannual fisheries management plan for the Baltic Sea that applies to cod, herring and sprat stocks. This plan replaces the management plan in place for the two Baltic cod stocks. The plan will ensure the sustainable exploitation of these Baltic Sea stocks, and provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on interactions within and between the stocks and with other aspects of the ecosystem and environment. In accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources, the main elements of the plan are: objectives and targets (Achieve levels of fishing mortality consistent with the principle of maximum sustainable yield); conservation reference points expressed in spawning biomass levels and specific conservation measures; provisions related to the landing obligation; framework of technical measures; periodic evaluation of the plan based on scientific advice. The plan does not include annual limits on fishing effort. It establishes regional cooperation in respect of adopting technical measures, provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for the by catches in the fisheries for the stocks concerned. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in June 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Kosovo on an EU-only Stabilisation and Association Agreement and adopted negotiating directives. The negotiations resulted in the initialling of the draft text of the agreement on 25 July 2014 which is the subject of this proposal. CONTENT: in this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and of Kosovo, of the other part, on behalf of the European Union, for the parts falling under the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Characteristics of the agreement: the Agreement is based on similar agreement signed with countries in the region, while taking into account that this is an EU-only agreement, as well as Kosovo‚Äôs particular situation. Legal basis: a ‚ÄòFirst agreement on principles governing the normalisation of relations‚Äô was reached on 19 April 2013 in the framework of the EU-facilitated dialogue. The Agreement as signed provides for the establishment of an association between the EU and Kosovo involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common actions and special procedure. The decision to conclude this Agreement should therefore be based on the legal basis providing for the establishment of an association allowing the Union to enter into commitments in all areas covered by the Treaties. Main objectives of the Agreement: the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo provides for wide-ranging cooperation: Overall, the cooperation is underpinned by EU financial and technical assistance, which provides Kosovo with the necessary support and assistance in the implementation of certain aspects of the agreement. Recognition of Kosovo‚Äôs international status: it is important to note that the conclusion of the future agreement is without prejudice to Member States' position on the status of Kosovo, which will be decided in accordance with their national practice and international law. None of the terms, wording or definitions used in this proposal and the attached text of the Agreement, nor any recourse to all the necessary legal bases for the conclusion of the Agreement constitute recognition of Kosovo by the Union as an independent State nor does it constitute recognition by individual Member States of Kosovo in that capacity where they have not taken such a step."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council invited the Commission to consider establishing minimum procedural rights for suspects or accused persons, and to address the issue of presumption of innocence, in order to promote better cooperation in that area. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant proceedings; (ii) a directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings Moreover, on 14 June 2011, the Commission published a Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention to reflect on ways to strengthen the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the area of detention, within the limits of the EU's competence. The principle of presumption of innocence has been developed over the years. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has held that Article 6(2) of the ECHR encompasses three key requirements: (i) the right not to be publicly presented as convicted by public authorities before the final judgment; (ii) the fact that the burden of proof is on prosecution and that any reasonable doubts on guilt should benefit the accused; and (iii) the right of the accused to be informed of the accusation against him. The right to be present at trial is also an essential right of defence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission‚Äôs analysis considers that there exist points in which legal safeguards should be improved with regard to certain aspects the presumption of innocence to strengthen this fundamental right. CONTENT: the draft directive aims to lay down minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the right of suspects and accused persons to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty by a final judgment. The proposal covers the following rights: 1) The right not to be presented guilty by public authorities before the final judgment : the ECtHR established as one of the basic aspects of the principle of presumption of innocence the fact that a court or public official may not publicly present the suspects or accused persons as if they were guilty of an offence if they have not been tried and convicted of it by a final judgment. 2) The burden of proof is on prosecution and any reasonable doubts on the guilt should benefit the accused: this presupposes that a court's judgment must be based on evidence as put before it and not on mere allegations or assumptions. 3) The right not to incriminate one-self and not to cooperate and the right to remain silent: these rights lie at the heart of the notion of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR. ¬∑  the right not to incriminate oneself presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression; ¬∑  the right to remain silent must be ensured and any inferences drawn from the fact that suspects make use of this right should be excluded. Suspects should be promptly informed of their right to remain silent. Such information should also refer to the content of the right to remain silent and of the consequences of renouncing to it and of invoking it. 4) Right to be present at one's trial : the proposal lays down this right, established by the ECtHR, of an accused to be present at the trial and also establishes limited exceptions to this right, in line with the Charter, the ECHR and EU law. It provides that Member States must ensure that the right to be present applies to any trial aiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and acquittal decisions). Non-regression clause : the proposal aims to ensure that setting common minimum standards does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the Charter and in the ECHR are maintained."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment was adopted on 21 December 1989 and became fully applicable as from 1 July 1995. It sets out basic requirements that PPE must comply with in order to be made available on the EU market. The PPE Directive applies to PPE that is defined as ‚Äúany device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards‚Äù. While the directive has successfully achieved its objectives in creating a single market and ensuring a high level of protection for users of PPE, certain problems have been encountered in its implementation. These concern products on the market that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, diverging approaches of the notified bodies, the effectiveness of the market surveillance as well as risks related to protective equipment which is currently not covered by the PPE Directive. The proposal modifies and clarifies a number of the provisions of the existing Directive and aligns it with the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation package adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option consists of amending the PPE Directive as it: (i) lead to an improved level of protection of the health and safety of the users; (ii) ensures a more effective work of the market surveillance authorities and consequently reduces the non-compliant products; (iii) does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies. CONTENT: this proposal intends to replace Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment by a Regulation. Its general objectives are to ensure a high level of protection of human health and safety whilst guaranteeing fair competition for economic operators on the Union market and simplifying the regulatory environment in this area. The proposal also clarifies a number of provisions of the existing Directive and aligns it with those of the Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (decision on the new legislative framework). Scope : the Commission proposes to enlarge the scope of the current PPE Directive by deleting the exclusions of PPE designed and manufactured for private use against heat, damp and water. The proposal keeps the other existing exclusions and clarifies that it does not apply to PPE for head, face or eye protection, subject to the relevant UNECE Regulation, of users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles. Two PPE specific definitions have been added in order to clarify the applicable conformity assessment procedures: ‚ÄúIndividually adapted PPE‚Äù and ‚ÄúMade-to-measure PPE‚Äù. Making available on the market, free movement, obligations of economic operators, CE marking : the proposal: contains the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision; obliges the manufacturer of PPE to draw up a technical documentation and to ensure that the PPE is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or a simplified EU declaration of conformity. Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for conformity assessment bodies (notified bodies). It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies with the individual Member State. Categories and Conformity assessment : the proposal simplifies the definition of the categories of PPE. The category only depends on the risk against which the PPE is intended to protect. Provisions are set out for made-to-measure PPE. PPE intended to protect the user against drowning, cuts by hand-held chain-saws, high-pressure cutting, bullet wounds or knife stabs, and harmful noise are subject to the most stringent conformity assessment procedure. Minor amendments have been made which change marginally three essential health and safety requirements (EHSR) in order to remove requirements shown to be impracticable or that create confusion. Application : the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements. However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation. Transitional provisions are foreseen for products manufactured and the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 89/686/EEC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: BACKGROUND : Directive 2009/142/EC setting out the conditions for the placing on the market and putting into service of appliance burning gaseous fuels is based on the ‚ÄúNew Approach‚Äù principles regarding technical harmonisation and standards. It sets out only the essential requirements applying to appliances burning gaseous fuels, whereas technical details are adopted by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation (Cenelec) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 on European Standardisation. Experience from the implementation of Directive 2009/142/EC has shown the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty as regards the definitions relating to its scope, the content of the Member States' communications of their gas types and supply pressures and certain essential requirements. The Commission proposes to replace Directive 2009/142/EC with a Regulation, so as to impose clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent transposition by Member States and ensure a uniform implementation throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option of modifying Directive 2009/142/EC was found to be the preferred option because: (i) it is considered more effective since it will be enforceable in law ; (ii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iii) no significant economic or social impacts could be identified. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation does not change the current scope of Directive 2009/142/EC. However, it modifies some of its provisions in order to clarify and update their content. The proposed Regulation is also aligned to the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). ¬∑ the removal of the outdated temperature limit of 105¬∞C from the definition of the scope; ¬∑ the introduction of currently missing definitions for the sector specific terminology under Directive 2009/142/EC; ¬∑ the introduction of a harmonised content and form of the communications of Member States on the types of gas and corresponding supply pressures used on their territory; ¬∑ the clarification of the relationship between Directive 2009/142/EC and other EU harmonisation legislation, including Ecodesign implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC and other Union energy policy instruments; ¬∑ the improvement of the readability of some of the provisions of Directive 2009/142/EC. The modification also includes the following points: Making available on the market of gas appliances and fittings, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement : the proposal contains the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. The proposed Regulation keeps the existing provision according to which fittings do not bear the CE marking. However, in order to improve clarity, the certificate accompanying fittings under Directive 2009/142/EC has been qualified as ‚ÄúFitting conformity certificate‚Äù, in order to better define its content and clarify its relationship with the EU declaration of conformity requirement under other possibly applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Notified bodies: in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. Conformity assessment: the proposal keeps the conformity assessment procedures provided for under Directive 2009/142/EC. However, it updates the corresponding modules in line with the NLF Decision. In particular, it keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all appliances and fittings. Furthermore, it keeps the current approach for the design phase, according to which the type examination of the product by the notified body takes the form of examination of the complete appliance or fitting. Therefore, in accordance with the NLF Decision, it provides only for the EU-type examination ‚Äì production type. ENTRY INRO FORCE: the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies, Member States and European Standardisation Bodies, time to adapt to the new requirements. A transitional provision is envisaged for the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2009/142/EC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/9/EC relating to cableway installations designed to carry persons became applicable on 3 May 2002. It sets out essential requirements with which cableway installations, their infrastructure, subsystems and safety components must comply in order to be safe. The main types of cableway installations covered by Directive 2000/9/EC are funiculars, gondolas, detachable chair lifts, fixed-grip chair lifts, aerial tramways, funitels, combined installations (made of several cableway types, such as those of gondolas and chairlifts) and drag lifts. Experience from the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC showed the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty mainly as regards the: (i) scope, in particular with regard to new types of cableway installations; (ii) lack of an appropriate range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems, which has led to divergent interpretations and implementation of the conformity assessment of subsystems. It is also necessary to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the ‚Äúgoods package‚Äù adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008 establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an ‚Äúalignment package‚Äù adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred solution consists of combining two options: (i) amending Directive 2000/9/EC; (ii) providing more extensive guidance on the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to its scope and of recommending the application of specific conformity assessment procedures for the assessment of subsystems. CONTENT: the proposal intends to replace Directive 2000/9/EC on cableway installations designed to carry persons by a Regulation. It lays down rules on the design and construction of cableway installations designed to transport persons and on the making available on the market and the free movement of subsystems and safety components for such installations. The proposal intends to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the ‚Äúgoods package‚Äù adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008. Scope : the proposal clarifies and updates the existing scope: in light of the development of new types of cableway installations, it is clarified that the exclusion of cableway installations used for leisure purposes in fairgrounds or amusement parks does not apply to cableway installations that are intended for a dual function, namely of transporting persons and for leisure activities; the exclusion of certain cableway installations intended for agricultural or industrial purposes is maintained, but it clarifies that it also covers cableway installations intended for the service of mountain shelters or huts that are not intended for the transport of the public; the current exclusion of cable-operated ferries is also updated to all cable-operated installations where the users or carriers are water-borne, such as cable-operated water ski installations; the exclusions provided for in Directive 2000/9/EC relating to rack-and-pinion railways and chain-driven installations are not reintroduced. Obligations of economic operators : the proposal contains, with regard to subsystems and safety components, the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. Harmonised standards : Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2000/9/EC which cover the same aspects have not been reintroduced in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. Conformity assessment : the proposal keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all subsystems and safety components. It introduces a range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems based on the conformity assessment modules of the NLF Decision. In this framework, it also introduces the CE marking for subsystems. Notified bodies : in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. Application : the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements. However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation. A transitional provision is foreseen for the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to subsystems and safety components so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main codified provisions : Purpose, scope and application : this Regulation provides for the absence of border control of persons crossing the internal borders between the Member States of the European Union. It lays down rules governing border control of persons crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union. In addition, it establishes the list of persons to which it the absence of control to internal borders applies. Border checks should be carried out in such a way as to fully respect human dignity. Border control should be carried out in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued. Types of controls : the Regulation provides that border control comprises not only checks on persons at border crossing points and surveillance between those border crossing points, but also an analysis of the risks for internal security and of the threats that may affect the security of external borders. Therefore, the Regulation sets out the conditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing points and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen Information System (SIS). Since only a verification of fingerprints can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the Schengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provisions have been made for the use at external borders of the Visa Information System (VIS). Exceptional circumstances and controls : the Regulations stipulates that it should be possible to have checks at external borders relaxed in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances in order to avoid excessive waiting time at border crossing points. The systematic stamping of the documents of third-country nationals remains an obligation in the event of border checks being relaxed. Stamping makes it possible to establish, with certainty, the date on which, and where, the border was crossed. In order to reduce the waiting times of persons enjoying the Union right of free movement, separate lanes, indicated by uniform signs in all Member States, should, where circumstances allow, be provided at border crossing points. Separate lanes should be provided in international airports. Where it is deemed appropriate and if local circumstances so allow, Member States should consider installing separate lanes at sea and land border crossing points. Exceptional reintroduction of controls and serious threats : the reintroduction of internal border control should remain exceptional. In an area without internal border control, it is necessary to have a common response to situations seriously affecting the public policy or internal security of that area, of parts thereof, or of one or more Member States, by allowing for the temporary reintroduction of internal border control in exceptional circumstances, but without jeopardising the principle of the free movement of persons. Given the impact that such measures of last resort may have on all persons having the right to move within the area without internal border control, the conditions and procedures for reintroducing such measures should be provided for, in order to ensure that they are exceptional and that the principle of proportionality is respected. In any case, the reintroduction of internal border control should remain an exception and should only be effected as a measure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of time, based on specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity which should be monitored at Union level. Where a serious threat to public policy or internal security requires immediate action, a Member State should be able to reintroduce border control at its internal borders for a period not exceeding ten days. Any prolongation of that period needs to be monitored at Union level. Conditions for the reintroduction of internal border control : the reintroduction of internal border control might exceptionally be necessary in the case of terrorist incidents or threats, or because of threats posed by organised crime. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders may only be justified under a specific Union-level procedure. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders could also be justified in the case of exceptional circumstances and as a measure of last resort where the overall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified in the context of a rigorous evaluation process in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981. The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region. To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Parties present at the 31st session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted by consensus Decisions 2012/5 and 2012/6 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals. Decision 2012/6 entered into force and has become effective. However, Decision 2012/5 requires ratification by the Parties to the Protocol. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals. This Protocol aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emissions into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), as harmful heavy metals subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, with a view to further protecting human health and the environment. In this respect, it requires Parties to reduce their total annual emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The amended Protocol sets out, in particular, stricter emission limit values for dust emissions from certain major stationary sources as well as flexible transitional arrangements that shall benefit those Parties that will accede the Protocol, as amended, between 1st January 2014 and 31 December 2019. The amendment to the Protocol is largely covered by current EU law notably via existing emission source control legislation, including above-mentioned Directive 2010/75/EU and the Commission Implementing Decisions adopted in accordance with this Directive and which establish the applicable BAT conclusions for various industrial sectors, such as the manufacture of glass and the production of iron and steel, cement, lime and magnesium oxide and chlor-alkali. This amendment shall be further transposed in particular via a new Directive setting updated national emission ceilings for certain atmopsheric pollutants and providing for annual national emission inventories that shall cover, among others, emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury."

To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Union is a Party to the 1998 Protocol following its approval on 19 February 2004. The Parties present at the 27th session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted by consensus Decisions 2009/1, 2009/2, 2009/3 and 2009/4 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants. Decision 2009/3 entered into force and has become effective. Decision 2009/4, as a Decision aimed at adopting a guidance document on best available techniques to control emissions of persistent organic pollutants, does not require ratification. On the other hand, Decisions 2009/1 and 2009/2 require ratification by the Parties to the Protocol. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the European Union, the amendments to the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants. In particular, Decisions 2009/1 and 2009/2, which amend the text of the Protocol and its Annexes have to be ratified by the Parties. The amended Protocol includes: The amended Protocol provides also some flexibility for Parties with an economy in transition that accede to the amended Protocol regarding the timeframes for the application of the ELVs and of the best available techniques (BAT) and the choice of the reference year as the basis upon which Parties must reduce their total annual emissions of PCDD/PCDF, PAHs, hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and PCBs."

CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council on the safeguard measures provided for in the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation. Regulation (EEC) No 2841/72 of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2015/849 of the European Parliament and the Council constitutes the main legal instrument in the prevention of the use of the Union's financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing. That Directive must be transposed by 26 June 2017. Recent terrorist attacks have brought to light emerging new trends, in particular regarding the way terrorist groups finance and conduct their operations. Currently, gaps still exist in the oversight of the many financial means used by terrorists, from cash and trade in cultural artefacts to virtual currencies and anonymous pre-paid cards. In addition to terrorist financing issues, offshore jurisdictions are often used as locations of intermediary entities that distance the real owner from the assets owned, often to avoid or evade tax. On 2 February 2016, the Commission presented an action plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing which underscores the need to adapt to new threats and to improve the present framework to that effect. On 22 April 2016 the informal ECOFIN Council also called for action in particular to: (i) enhance the accessibility of beneficial ownership registers, (ii) clarify the registration requirements for trusts, (iii) speed up the interconnection of national beneficial ownership registers, (iv) promote automatic exchange of information on beneficial ownership, and (v) strengthen customer due diligence rules In its resolution of 16 December 2015, the European Parliament had already stressed that improved transparency, coordination and convergence in relation to corporate tax policies provides an effective framework to guarantee fair competition between firms in the Union and protect state budgets from adverse outcomes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment draws on relevant reports issued by Union and international organisations such as the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Central Bank (ECB), Europol, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), and the FATF. The need to formulate specific regulatory provisions was retained as essential and as being the most appropriate option. CONTENT: the proposal sets out a series of measures to better counter the financing of terrorism and to ensure increased transparency of financial transactions and of corporate entities under the preventive legal framework in place in the Union, namely Directive (EU) 2015/849 (the ""4AMLD""). It also sets out certain consequential changes to the relevant company law rules under Directive 2009/101/EC. The amendments to the 4AMLD relate to the following points: Designate virtual currency exchange platforms as obliged entities : in order to improve the detection of suspicious virtual currency transactions, it is proposed to include virtual currency exchange platforms as well as custodian wallet providers within the scope of the Directive. Set lower maximum transaction limits for certain pre-paid instruments : it is proposed to suppress anonymity for the online use of reloadable and non-reloadable prepaid cards, and reduce the existing EUR 250 threshold for anonymous prepaid cards to EUR 150 when used face-to-face. Enable Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to request information on money laundering and terrorist financing from any obliged entity : the proposal clarifies the FIUs' mandate to request supplementary information from any obliged entity and have direct access to information held by obliged entities. Enable FIUs and competent authorities to identify holders of bank and payment accounts : the Commission proposes to require Member States to set up automated centralised mechanisms - such as a central registry or an electronic data retrieval system ‚Äì at Member State level, allowing for the swift identification of account holders. This mechanism would be directly accessible to national FIUs and potentially other competent authorities active in the field of anti-money laundering or counter-terrorist financing. Harmonise the EU approach towards high-risk third countries : it is proposed to modify the 4AMLD by providing a prescriptive list of enhanced customer due diligence measures to be applied by obliged entities, combined with an illustrative list of countermeasures that could be applied when dealing with high-risk third countries designated by the Commission. Improve access to the beneficial ownership registers : Member States will make public certain information of the beneficial ownership registers on companies and business-related trusts. Information on all other trusts will be included in the national registers and available to parties who can show a legitimate interest. The beneficial owners who have 10% ownership in certain companies that present a risk of being used for money laundering and tax evasion will be included in the registries. The threshold remains at 25% for all other companies. Interconnection of the registers : the proposal provides for the direct interconnection of the registers to facilitate cooperation between Member States. Extending the information available to authorities : the Commission proposes that existing, as well as new, accounts should be subject to due diligence controls."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the overall objective of the legislative framework, which is the sustainable development of organic production, is currently not fully met. It leads to lost opportunities for farmers and operators in the Union (the organic land area in the Union has only doubled in the last 10 years, while the market has increased fourfold), a risk of limitation to the organic market expansion and a risk of limitation to the environmental benefits associated with organic production. The main drivers are: regulatory and non-regulatory obstacles to the development of organic production in the Union; a risk of erosion of consumer confidence, notably because of the many exceptions that are watering down organic production rules and because of the fraud cases that have developed in connection with shortcomings in the control system and in the import regime; complicated labelling rules; unfair competition among operators in the Union and in Third Countries. When adopting Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products, the Council earmarked a series of issues on which the Commission was required to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council, after having reviewed the experience gained from the application of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. The Council adopted conclusions on the Commission's report at its Agriculture and Fisheries meeting of 13-14 May 20133 and called on the Member States and on the Commission to develop the organic production sector at an ambitious level by reviewing the current legal framework, with a view to improving its usability while providing for a period of stability and certainty, aiming at further clarification and simplification. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option was the principle-driven option which aims at re-focusing organic production on its principles, which would be better reflected in the production rules. Exceptional rules would be ended. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to replace Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 with a new Regulation in order to:(i) remove the obstacles to the development of organic production in the Union, (ii) guarantee fair competition for farmers and operators and to improve the functioning of the internal market; (iii) maintain or improve consumer confidence in organic products. Respecting principles : organic production must continue to adhere to a set of principles that reflect closely the expectations of consumers. These principles include: respect for nature's systems and cycles and sustainment and enhancement of the state of soil, water, air and biodiversity, of the health of plants and animals and of the balance between them; responsible use of energy and natural resources; respect of high animal welfare standards and, in particular, fulfilment of animals‚Äô species-specific behavioural needs; appropriate design and management of biological processes based on ecological systems using natural resources which are internal to the system by methods that: (i) use living organisms and mechanical production methods; (ii) practice land-related crop cultivation and livestock production or practice aquaculture which complies with the principle of sustainable exploitation of fisheries; (iii) exclude the use of GMOs. Strengthening and harmonising production rules : it is proposed to strengthen and harmonise production rules by removing exceptions, except where temporary measures are necessary in order to allow organic production to continue or recommence in the case of catastrophic circumstances. Organic agricultural holdings have to be entirely managed in compliance with the requirements applicable to organic production and retroactive acknowledgement of the conversion period is in principle not possible any more. The agricultural ingredients used in the composition of organic processed products have to be exclusively organic. With the exceptions of micro-enterprises, organic operators other than farmers or operators producing seaweed or aquaculture animals are required to develop a system for improving their environmental performance. Improving control systems : the control system is improved by integrating all control-related provisions into a single legislative text under the Commission proposal for a Regulation on official controls and other official activities in food and feed. Controllability is enhanced by clarification, simplification and harmonisation of the production rules and the removal of a series of possible exceptions to such rules. The proposal seeks to do away with the possibility to exempt certain types of retailers provided for in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007, which has led to different interpretations and practices across Member States and has made management, supervision and control more difficult. The risk-based approach to official controls is reinforced by removing the requirement for mandatory annual verification of compliance of all operators provided for in Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. Fees collected for controls : the proposal introduces specific provisions in order to increase transparency with regard to fees that may be collected for the controls, and the provisions related to publication of operators together with information on their certification status are reinforced. Reduction of administrative burdens : a system of group certification is introduced for small-scale farmers in the Union with a view to reducing inspection and certification costs and the associated administrative burden, strengthening local networks, contributing to better market outlets, and ensuring a level playing field with operators in third countries. Enhanced traceability and fraud prevention : it is proposed that operators may not be controlled by different control authorities or bodies for the same groups of products across different stages of the organic chain. Detection of non-authorised products or substances : specific provisions are also introduced to harmonise action to be taken when non-authorised products or substances are detected. In this context, there may be instances where farmers are prevented from marketing their products as organic due to the unintentional presence of non-authorised products or substances. Member States may be authorised by the Commission to grant national payments to compensate for the losses incurred in such instances. Adaptation of the trade regime : the trade regime is adapted to improve the level playing for the organic operators of the European Union and in Third Countries and to better ensure consumer confidence. The possibility of equivalence agreements with Third Countries remains while the system of unilateral equivalency is phased out. The recognition of control bodies is proposed to be progressively shifted to a compliance regime. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal allocates a budget for technical assistance measures. Estimated costs for expenditure (including administrative costs) amount to EUR 2.184 million for the period 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need for statistical information on businesses for policymaking and other purposes is growing. However, the current system for producing European business statistics is fragmented into separate domain-specific regulations which leads to inconsistencies in the data collected and inefficiencies in their production. The draft Regulation on European business statistics, amending Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 and repealing 10 legal acts in the field of business statistics (FRIBS) is part of the Commission‚Äôs REFIT Programme. This programme seeks to simplify EU law and reduce unnecessary regulatory costs. It identified business statistics as one of its priority area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is the one which seeks to modernise the European business statistics in a single framework (FRIBS) using a mix of measures, including alternative options for the modernisation of Intrastat. This option shall enable European business statistics to be put into one single legal framework FRIBS which will implicitly guarantee much higher consistency of business statistics. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics related to the structure, the economic activities and the performance of businesses, as well as on the international transactions and research and development activities of the Union economy. The proposal envisages the integration of statistical requirements and legal acts for business statistics by streamlining and simplifying them and reducing the burden on businesses. It is expected to deliver: better quality European Statistical System (ESS) business registers, common definitions to be used in all the statistical domains it covers, the exchange of identifiable micro-data and an integrated data structure. The proposed Regulation covers the following issues: data sources to be used for business statistics and statistical business registers; business statistics (subject areas and the topics) as well as the periodicity with which the topics need to be provided; business registers. The Commission (Eurostat) shall set up the EuroGroups Register of multinational enterprise groups for statistical purposes at Union level; exchange of confidential data for the purpose of intra-Union trade in goods statistics; quality, transmission and dissemination: data quality and metadata reporting, data and metadata transmission and confidentiality regarding statistical data dissemination on international trade in goods. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial impact of the proposal is of unlimited duration with a start-up period of 3 years, from 2019 to 2021. The total appropriations for 2019 and 2020 are estimated at EUR 46.453 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Science and Technology Centre ('ISTC') was set up in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was funded together with other Parties (USA, Canada, and Japan) through an international multilateral agreement for the purpose of non-proliferation of scientific and technical expertise related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Over time, other Parties joined the Agreement, i.e. Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan, Republic of Korea, Norway, Russian Federation and Tajikistan. The ISTC works at the crossroads between scientific research and non-proliferation, and has funded almost 3000 projects with a total value of over EUR 550 million. The Union contribution amounts to approximately EUR 270 million. In the latest years the concept and the work of the ISTC as a science centre evolved to take into account the changing proliferation landscape, the results of threat analyses and the evolving needs of the parties. It increasingly focused on supporting projects aiming at mitigation of broader Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear risks, not necessarily focused on scientists' redirection, but on promoting bio safety and biosecurity, physical upgrades of laboratories as well as stimulation of networking activities among relevant scientific communities. Following the 2010 announced withdrawal of the Russian Federation, that becomes effective on 15 July 2015, the Parties agreed that a new Agreement needs to be put in place in order for the Centre to effectively fulfil its mandate under changed circumstances. On 21 October 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to start negotiations. The aims set out in the negotiating directives have been fully met. In accordance with the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1989 the Agreement continuing the International Science and Technology Centre between the European Union and Euratom acting as one Party and Georgia, Japan, Norway, the Kyrgyz Republic, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Tajikistan, and the United States of America was signed on 9 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council adopt a decision aiming to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement continuing the International Science and Technology Centre between the European Union and Euratom acting as one Party and Georgia, Japan, Norway, the Kyrgyz Republic, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Tajikistan, and the United States.

However, when people travel in the EU, they frequently cannot enjoy such cross-border portability or can do so only to a limited extent. The absence of, or problems with, cross border portability of online content services in the EU results from the licensing practices of right holders and/or the commercial practices of service providers. Cross-border portability concerns online content services to which consumers have lawful access, or content that they purchased or rented online in their country of residence and to which they want to continue to have access when travelling in the EU. Consumer demand for the cross-border portability of online content services is substantial and expected to grow The Digital Single Market Strategy puts forward a range of initiatives with the objective of creating an internal market for digital content and services. This proposal is among the first of the initiatives under the strategy. The Commission considers that the proposal will have positive effects on competitiveness as it will help innovation in online content services and attract more consumers to them. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option, in addition to establishing a mechanism ensuring portability: (i) would impose an obligation on providers of online content services to ensure cross-border portability of such services and (ii) would establish that any provisions in contracts limiting cross-border portability would be unenforceable. This option would respond to consumers' expectations and the impact on industry is expected to be marginal because the portability of online content services does not extend the range of users of the service and as such does not challenge the territorial exclusivity of licences CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces a common approach to ensuring that subscribers to online content services in the Union, which are delivered on a portable basis, can receive these services when temporarily present in another Member State (cross-border portability). Definitions : the proposal contains definitions that will need to be interpreted in a uniform manner in the EU: a ""subscriber"" is defined as a consumer who, on the basis of a contract for the provision of an online content service, may access and use such service in the Member State of his or her residence; a ""consumer"" is defined as any natural person who, in contracts covered by the regulation, is acting for purposes which are outside his or her trade, business, craft or profession. ""Online content service"" is covered by the proposal when: (i) the service is lawfully provided online in the Member State of residence; (ii) the service is provided on a portable basis; (iii) the service is an audiovisual media service within the meaning of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council or a service whose main feature is the provision of access to works, other subject matter or transmissions of broadcasting organisations. Two scenarios are covered as regards online content services: (i) services which are provided for payment of money (directly or indirectly); and (ii) services which are provided without payment of money provided that the subscriber's Member State of residence is verified by the service provider. if a subscriber receives an online content service without payment of money, the provider will only be obliged to enable the subscriber to enjoy cross-border portability if the provider verifies the subscriber's Member State of residence; if, however, a consumer just accepts the terms and conditions of a free of charge online content service but does not register on a website of such service (and hence the provider does not verify the Member State of residence of such a consumer), the service provider will not be obliged to provide cross-border portability for such service. Cross-border portability of online content services : the proposal requires the provider to enable a subscriber to use the online content service while the subscriber is temporarily present in another Member State. This applies to the same content, on the same range and number of devices and the same range of functionalities as offered in the Member State of residence. However, this obligation does not extend to any quality requirements applicable to the delivery of such service when the service is provided in the Member State of residence. Nevertheless, if the provider expressly agrees to guarantee certain quality of delivery to subscribers while temporarily present in other Member States, the provider shall be bound by such agreement. In addition, the draft regulation will oblige the provider to inform the subscriber of the quality of delivery of the online content service when accessed and used in a Member State other than the Member State of residence. Localisation: the proposal sets out a mechanism establishing the localisation of the service for purposes of portability: the provision as well as the access to and use of the service by a subscriber who is temporarily present in another Member State is deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. For the licensing of copyright and related rights, this means that the relevant copyright acts, which occur when the service is provided to consumers on a basis of crossborder portability, are deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. Contractual provisions : the proposal renders unenforceable: any contractual terms contrary to the cross-border portability obligation, in particular those which limit either consumer's possibilities as to the cross-border portability of his or her online content services or service provider's ability to deliver it; any contractual terms contrary to the legal mechanism which enables service providers to comply with the cross-border portability obligation. However, right holders may require that the service provider makes use of means in order to verify that the service is provided in conformity with the regulation. The draft regulation also provides that: (i) the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the Regulation shall be carried out in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC; (ii) the regulation shall also apply to any contracts concluded and rights acquired before the date of the application of the regulation if they are relevant for the provision of the service, the access to or the use of the service."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: companies increasingly use digital tools in their business and they also need to interact with public authorities. Currently the EU company law (Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council) includes certain elements of digitalisation such as the obligation for Member States to make available online information about limited liability companies registered in central, commercial and companies registers (""registers""). However, these requirements are limited and lack precision, leading to a very diverse implementation at national level. In addition, certain digital processes, for instance online company registration, are not covered at all by EU law and only a number of Member States address them at national level. The lack of rules for online registration, filing and publication or the divergence of such rules in the Member States create unnecessary costs and burdens to entrepreneurs who wish to set up a new business or to expand their business by registering subsidiaries or branches or fulfil specific requirements online. The eGovernment action plan 2016-2020 specifically recognised the importance of improving the use of digital tools to meet company law requirements. The proposed Regulation which establishes the Single Digital Gateway foresees general rules for online provision of information, procedures and assistance services relevant for the functioning of the internal market. The European Parliament, in its 2017 resolution on the e-Government Action Plan, called on the Commission to consider further ways to promote digital solutions for formalities throughout a company's lifecycle. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three main issues in relation to the use of digital tools in company law were examined: online registration (creation of a company as legal entity) and filing of documents to the business register : the preferred option would provide for rules on the online registration of company and branch and online filing of company documents in all Member States; multiple submission of the same information by companies : the preferred option seeks simplification by introducing rules requiring Member States to ensure that, when the register receives certain data from the company (e.g. change of company name, change of registered office or latest annual accounts), it then sends it to the register in another Member State where the company has a branch (as opposed to the company doing that); online access to company information held in business registers : the preferred option proposes to expand the set of company data to be provided free of charge by all business registers, while Member States could still charge fees for other information. CONTENT: this proposal is aimed to complement the existing rules on EU company law that are codified in Directive (EU) 2017/1132. Specifically, the proposal: ensures the mandatory recognition of e-IDAS compliant electronic identification means of Union citizens issued in another Member State and allows at the same time Member States to recognise other identification means. As a safeguard to avoid fraud, the provision allows Member States to require the physical presence of relevant persons before a competent authority but only in case of genuine suspicion based on reasonable grounds; requires Member States to ensure that rules on fees for the registration and filing of documents and information online are transparent and applied in a non-discriminatory manner; fees charged by registers should not exceed the administrative costs of providing the service; payments for the completion of online procedures could be made by means of a payment service widely available in cross-border payment services; ensures that those that want to set-up and operate companies and branches cross-border have easy access to all relevant information about registration of and filing by companies and branches; introduces the possibility to register companies online without the necessity for the applicant, or his representative, to appear in person before any competent authority or before any other person or body. Member States may opt-out from this obligation in relation to public limited liability companies given the complexity of establishment and registration of such companies; a general maximum time limit of five working days is established for the completion of the process for the registration of companies online; provides a legal framework for Member States to request information from other Member States concerning disqualified directors. Member States may refuse the appointment of a person as a director of a company or branch who is currently disqualified from acting as a director in another Member State; requires Member States to ensure that fully online solutions in case of submitting the necessary information to the register throughout the lifecycle of the company, similarly to the online registration of companies;; introduces an obligation for Member States to ensure that an applicant can obtain electronic extracts authenticated by means of trust services from the registers; allows, by applying the ""once and for all"" principle, companies to avoid having to present the same information several times to different authorities during the life cycle of a company; introduces online registration and online filing for branches, in the same way as for companies; requires Member States to inform each other, via the system of interconnection of business registers, about branch closures registered in a Member State other than the one where the company is registered. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is expected to have certain budgetary implications at least on some of the Member States who may need to adapt their IT systems in order to support the new provisions. However, those setting up costs would be recovered in the medium and long term through saving time and resources in Member States' administration."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal for a Regulation amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Captial Requirements Regulation ‚Äì CRR) is part of a package of measures to deepen the Capital Markets Union (CMU), together with the Communication ""Completing Capital Markets Union by 2019 ‚Äì time to accelerate delivery"". Covered bonds are financial instruments that are generally issued by banks to fund the economy. They facilitate the financing of mortgage and public sector loans, thereby supporting lending more broadly. Covered bonds fared well during the financial crisis and proved to be a reliable and stable funding source at a time as other funding channels dried up. However, diverse rules across Member States affect the credit strength of those instruments. In addition, covered bonds markets are unevenly developed across the Single Market. While they are very important in some Member States, they are less developed in others. While they benefit from preferential prudential and regulatory treatment in various respects in the light of the lower risks (e.g. banks investing in them do not have to set aside as much regulatory capital as when they invest in other assets), Union law does not comprehensively address what actually constitutes a covered bond. The Commission considers that a Union legislative framework on covered bonds should: expand the capacity of credit institutions to provide financing to the real economy and contribute to the development of covered bonds across the Union, particularly in Member States where no market for them currently exists; increase cross-border flows of capital and investment which would provide investors with a wider and safer range of investment opportunities, contribute to financial stability and help finance the real economy. The framework consists of a Directive on definitions and standards for covered bonds and a Regulation amending the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) ‚Äì the two instruments should be seen as a single package. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the four options considered, the option chosen is that of minimum harmonisation based on national regimes. It is based on the recommendations made in the 2016 European Banking Authority (EBA) report, with the exception of a few deviations. It is likely to be the most effective in achieving the objectives, while at the same time being efficient and minimising disruption and transition costs. It is also one of the more ambitious options in regulatory terms, while enjoying the most support from stakeholders. CONTENT: this proposed Regulation will mainly amend Article 129 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)) with the aim of strengthening the conditions for granting preferential capital treatment by adding further requirements. The amendments build on the current prudential treatment but add requirements on minimum overcollateralisation and substitution assets. Article 129 of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 allows covered bonds to be collateralised by senior units issued by French Fonds Communs de Titrisation or equivalent entities governed by the laws of a Member State that securitise residential or commercial property exposures under certain conditions, including the provision that such units do not exceed 10 % of the nominal amount of the outstanding issue. This possibility is repealed, as only a few national covered bond frameworks allow the inclusion of residential or commercial mortgage-backed securities. The proposed amendments introduce a new requirement on a minimum level of overcollateralisation (a level of collateral exceeding the coverage requirements). This level is set at 2 and 5%, depending on the assets in the cover pool, based on a nominal calculation method."

It is likely to be the most effective in achieving the objectives, while at the same time being efficient and minimising disruption and transition costs. It is also one of the more ambitious options in regulatory terms, while enjoying the most support from stakeholders. CONTENT: this proposed Directive will specify the core elements of covered bonds and provide a common definition as a consistent and sufficiently detailed point of reference for prudential regulation purposes, applicable across financial sectors. The Directive defines covered bonds as debt obligations issued by credit institutions and secured against a ring-fenced pool of assets to which bondholders have direct recourse as preferred creditors. The Directive, in continuity with this tradition, only allows credit institutions to issue covered bonds. This is coherent with the inherent nature of the instrument which is to provide funding for loans, and granting loans on a large scale is a credit institution's business. In addition, credit institutions have the necessary knowledge and management capability of credit risk in relation to the loans in the cover pool and they are subject to sound capital requirements which contribute to underpin the investor protection as laid down in the dual recourse mechanism. The proposal also establishes: a more articulated series of structural requirements of coverage bonds: (i) dual recourse gives investors a double claim on both the issuer of covered bonds and the assets in the cover pool; (ii) bankruptcy protection; (iii) ensure the quality of the cover pool, in particular ensuring that only high-quality assets are used as collateral; (iv) liquidity and transparency requirements; (v) regulation of the structures to ensure they are not unnecessarily complex or opaque; (vi) the possibility for Member States to require a cover pool monitor; covered bond public supervision : in order to protect investors, the proposed Directive harmonises the components of such supervision and specifies the tasks and responsibilities of the national competent authorities performing it. Member States should be able to appoint different competent authorities; rules authorising the use of the ‚ÄòEuropean covered bonds‚Äô label : the proposal allows credit institutions to use the specific 'European Covered Bonds' label when issuing covered bonds. The use of the label would make it easier for investors to assess the quality of the covered bonds. It should however be facultative and Member States should be able to keep their own national denominations and labelling framework in place in parallel to the 'European Covered Bonds' label, provided that these comply with the requirements set out in this Directive; publication obligations of competent authorities performing the covered bond public supervision : administrative penalties and other administrative measures laid down by Member States should satisfy certain essential requirements in relation to the addressees of those penalties or measures, the criteria to be taken into account in their application, the publication obligations of competent authorities performing the covered bond public supervision, the power to impose penalties and the level of administrative pecuniary penalties that may be imposed."

BACKGROUND: maritime transport operators face a wide range of legal reporting requirements each time a ship arrives in or leaves a port (a port call). Over two million port calls are made annually in the EU. Shipping sector staff currently spend an annual total of about 4.6 million hours on reporting. The evaluation conducted in 2016-2017 as part of the fitness check on the Maritime Transport Policy found that Directive 2010/65/EU was not sufficiently effective or efficient, although its objectives remained very relevant. The conclusion was that there was considerable scope for further simplification and for reducing the administrative burden on shipping operators. Three problems were identified: a lack of harmonisation between the maritime National Single Windows for ship reporting; the current system for coordinating reporting via National Single Windows only brings together some of the legal reporting obligations faced by ships; there is an inefficient data-sharing environment in most Member States and within the EU as a whole. The Commission therefore proposes to facilitate reporting formalities in the maritime sector. This initiative is part of the Third ‚ÄòEurope on the Move‚Äô Package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017 and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option (ensuring a harmonised reporting system, while respecting the National Single Windows) is expected to result in a total additional cost of EUR 29.4 million between 2020 and 2030 and a saving of 22-25 million working hours over the same period. This option offers the greatest benefit at an acceptable cost. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation repealing Directive 2010/65/EU establishes a framework for a harmonised and interoperable European Maritime Single Window environment (‚ÄòEMSWe‚Äô), based on National Single Windows, in order to facilitate electronic transmission of information in relation to reporting obligations for ships arriving and staying in and departing from a Union port. By developing binding technical interface specifications, adopting common data requirements and processes, and establishing clear rules and rights for submission and sharing of information, a simplified reporting environment will be achieved. The result is that the shipping operators will be able to report the same data set in the same way regardless of where they go, if they choose to use the harmonised reporting entry point. This proposal will also improve interoperability and interconnection between the relevant systems, thus enabling data to be shared and reused more efficiently, as appropriate and contribute to increased efficiency of digital reporting for maritime operators by facilitating data sharing/reuse for the application of the ‚Äòreporting only once‚Äô principle. BUDGET IMPLICATIONS: the expected costs of IT services and IT system development are up to EUR 13.5 million over the 11 years from 2020 to 2030. The Commission proposes that its costs be covered by the budget line Support activities to the European transport policy and passenger rights including communication activities (budget reference 06.02.05)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Directive. BACKGROUND: in the absence of harmonised Union rules on sustainability-related disclosures to end-investors, it is likely that diverging measures will continue to be adopted at national level and different approaches in different financial services sectors might persist. In ensuring compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement, Member States are likely to adopt divergent national measures which could create obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market and be detrimental to financial market participants and financial advisors. This proposal is part of a wider Commission initiative on sustainable development. It aims to bring institutional investors (management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), alternative investment fund managers (FIA), insurance companies, institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORP), European venture capital fund managers (EuVECA), European social entrepreneurship fund managers (EuSEF) and investment firms) to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into their internal processes and to inform their clients. The proposal is presented in parallel with a proposal to help investors compare the carbon footprint of investments. This should ensure that financial market participants ‚Äî undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) management companies, alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs), insurance undertakings, institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs), European venture capital fund (EuVECA) managers, European social entrepreneurship funds (EuSEF) managers and investment firms - that receive a mandate from their clients or beneficiaries to take investment decisions on their behalf would integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their internal processes and inform their clients in this respect. The proposal is presented in parallel with a proposal to help investors compare the carbon footprint of investments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a clear and coherent approach on integration of ESG risks would have the following economic impacts: end-investors will have more information on how financial market participants and financial advisors integrate ESG risks in their investment decision-making or advisory processes. ESG risks would be more systematically taken into account in financial modelling, leading to an optimal risk-return trade-off at least in the long-term, thereby fostering market efficiency. This will encourage financial market participants and financial advisors to be innovative in investment strategies or in their recommendations. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes harmonised rules on transparency to be applied by financial market participants, by insurance intermediaries providing advice on insurance-based investment products and by financial advisers in relation to: the integration of sustainability risks in their investment decision-making processes or, where relevant, advisory processes; transparency as regards financial products which target sustainable investments, including reduction in carbon emissions. The term ‚Äòsustainable investments‚Äô covers: (i) investments in an economic activity that contributes to an environmental objective; (ii) investments in an economic activity that contributes to a social objective, and in particular an investment that contributes to tackling inequality, an investment fostering social cohesion, social integration and labour relations, or an investment in human capital or economically or socially disadvantaged communities; (iii) investments in companies following good governance practices, and in particular companies with sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of relevant staff and tax compliance. Specifically, the proposal: requires financial market participants to publish written policies on the integration of sustainability risks in investment decision making process; obliges financial market participants to publish them on their websites and maintain the policies up-to-date. This obligation also extends to financial advisors. obliges financial market participants and financial advisors market financial products or services claim that such products or services pursue sustainable investment objectives, obliging them to disclose information on the contribution of the investment decisions to the sustainable investment objectives (ex-post disclosure in regular reporting); provides that financial market participants and financial advisors must ensure that marketing communications do not contradict the information disclosed pursuant to this Regulation. This proposal amends Directive (EU) 2016/2341. It empowerments the Commission to adopt delegated acts specifying the ‚Äòprudent person‚Äô rule with respect to the consideration of ESG risks and the inclusion of ESG factors in internal investment decisions and risk management processes."

In November 2016, the Commission adopted the EMIR report, which pointed to the need to eliminate disproportionate costs and burdens on small companies and to simplify rules without compromising financial stability. Accordingly, the proposal sets out a series of targeted amendments to the EMIR Regulation, in order to simplify the rules and ensure that the latter are more proportionate. At the same time the proposal maintains all key elements of the framework that have proved to allow achieving the objectives of EMIR. It is related to and consistent with the ongoing initiative to establish a Capital Markets Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysis the costs and benefits of areas of EMIR where targeted action could ensure fulfilment of the EMIR objectives in a more proportionate, efficient and effective manner. The analysis shows that it would be possible to obtain a reduction of costs and restrictions, and at the same time, simplify the Regulation. It is estimated that the combined effect of all preferred options, calculated solely for the purpose of the impact assessment, amount to cost reductions ranging from EUR 2.3 billion to EUR 6.9 billion in fixed (one-off) costs and from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.66 billion in operational costs. Overall, businesses, SMEs, and micro-enterprises will, in particular, benefit from (i) reducing regulatory requirements in cases where disproportionate compliance costs appear to outweigh prudential benefits and (ii) improving access to clearing. There should be no significant relevant social and economic cost. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in order to simplify the rules applicable to over the counter derivatives and make them more proportionate in order to reduce costs and regulatory burden weighing on market participants, without putting at risk financial stability. The proposal simplifies reporting requirements for all counterparties. It re-focuses the scope of the clearing obligation for financial counterparties to include some additional relevant market players while exempting the smallest financial counterparties. Specifically the proposal: removes the requirement to report historic transactions, i.e. transactions that were not outstanding on the starting date of the reporting obligation on 12 February 2014; introduces improvements to ensure the quality of reported data for trade repositories; establishes single-sided reporting by the central counterparties for exchange-traded derivatives transactions ('ETDs'); provides that, for transactions other than ETD transactions, the responsibility for reporting transactions between a small non-financial counterparty (i.e. not subject to the clearing obligation) and a financial counterparty should be on the financial counterparty to the trade; exempts intragroup transactions involving any non-financial counterparties from the reporting obligation; provides, with regards to non-financial counterparties, that only non-hedging contracts are counted towards the thresholds triggering the clearing obligation; introduces a new three‚Äìyear temporary exemption for pension funds from central clearing; increases the upper limit of basic amount of fines for infringements of EMIR requirements by trade repositories; clarifies the interaction between EMIR default management tools and national insolvency laws to ensure the insolvency remoteness of client assets; requires observance of the principle to provide clearing services under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms ('FRAND' principle). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the financial crisis, and in line with the commitment made at the 2009 G20 in Pittsburgh, the EU adopted Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on European market infrastructures (EMIR) to reduce systemic risk associated with the significant use of derivatives in order to preserve financial stability. The EMIR contains several measures to ensure that standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contracts are cleared through a Central Counterparty (CCP). It introduces strict prudential, organisational and business conduct requirements for CCPs and established arrangements for their prudential supervision to minimise any risk to users of a CCP and underpin systemic stability. There are currently 17 central counterparties established in the EU, all of which are approved under EMIR to offer their services within the Union, although not all of them are authorised to clear all asset classes (e.g. only 2 CCPs clear credit derivatives, only 2 CCPs clear inflation derivatives). An additional 28 third-country CCPs have been recognised under EMIR's equivalence provisions, allowing them to offer their services in the EU. Under EMIR, EU CCPs are supervised by colleges of national supervisors, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), relevant members of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), and other relevant authorities. Since the adoption of EMIR, the volume of CCP activity ‚Äì in the EU and globally - has grown rapidly both in scale and in scope. As of end of June 2016, around 62% of the global value of all OTC derivatives contracts and asset classes (interest rates, credit default, foreign exchange, etc.) were centrally cleared by CCPs, which is equivalent to $337 trillion. The growing importance of CCPs in the financial system and the associated concentration of credit risk in these infrastructures have drawn the attention of governments, regulators, supervisors, central banks and market participants. The Commission therefore considers that further reforms to harmonise and strengthen the monitoring of EU and third country CCPs are now necessary. The proposal is in line with the Commission proposal for a Regulation on CCP Recovery and Resolution in November 2016. It complements the Commission's proposal for targeted amendments to EMIR which seeks to simplify certain EMIR requirements and make them more proportionate in order to reduce excessive costs for market participants, without compromising financial stability. This proposal should therefore provide further incentives for market participants to use central clearing ‚Äì again reinforcing the importance of CCPs within the financial system. It also takes into account feedback received following the publication of the Commission's Communication on responding to challenges for critical financial market infrastructures. The objective of the proposal is to ensure that authorities are appropriately prepared to address a failing CCP, safeguarding financial stability and limiting taxpayer costs. The CCP Recovery and Resolution proposal refocused attention on the supervisory arrangements for EU and third country CCPs included in EMIR and the extent to which these arrangements can be made more effective five years after adoption of EMIR. This proposal is currently under negotiations in the European Parliament and the Council. That ongoing work-stream needs to be coordinated and consistent with the current proposal. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred options in the impact assessment relate to targeted amendments of the of the supervisory arrangements of EMIR applying both to CCPs established in the EU and to third-country CCPs with a view to: enhancing the supervision of CCPs established in the EU : the current supervisory arrangements should be streamlined and further centralised through the establishment of a European supervisory mechanism, ensuring the proper involvement of national authorities, central banks of issue and ESMA within the scope of their responsibilities; enhancing supervisory arrangements within the EU designed to mitigate the risks related to third-country CCPs : these CCPs could be subject to a ‚Äòsliding scale‚Äô of additional supervisory requirements by ESMA and relevant CBIs based on objective criteria or thresholds. CONTENT: this proposal aims to introduce specific amendments to the EMIR and ESMA regulations with a view to establishing a clear and coherent supervisory arrangements for CCPs established in the EU and in third countries. The objective is to ensure that the EU authorities and national authorities are able to cope with a failing CCP, maintain financial stability and avoid that costs associated with the restructuring and the resolution of failing CCPs fall on taxpayers. The main elements of the proposal are: Creation of a new supervisory mechanism : the proposal also ensures closer cooperation between supervisory authorities and central banks responsible for EU currencies. To achieve this, a newly-created supervisory mechanism will be established within European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) ('CCP Executive Session') which will be responsible for ensuring a more coherent and consistent supervision of EU CCPs as well more robust supervision of CCPs in non-EU countries, or 'third countries'. The proposed amendments focus on (i) the accountability and independence of the members of the CCP Executive Session; (ii) the interactions between the CCP Executive Session and the tasks of the Executive Director of ESMA; (iii) strengthening ESMA's information-gathering capacity; and (iv) the conditions and procedures for the authorisation and the supervision of the CCPs established in the Union. Third country central counterparties : the proposal aims to make the process of recognition and supervision of third country CCPs stricter for those countries which are of systemic importance to the EU. The proposal introduces a new ""two tier"" system for classifying third-country CCPs. Non-systemically important CCPs (Tier 1) will continue to be able to operate under the existing EMIR equivalence framework. However, systemically important CCPs (so-called Tier 2 CCPs) will be subject to stricter requirements. These requirements include: compliance with the necessary prudential requirements for EU-CCPs while taking into account third-country rules; confirmation from the relevant EU central banks that the CCP complies with any additional requirements set by those central banks (e.g. the availability or type of collateral held in a CCP, segregation requirements, liquidity arrangements, etc.); the agreement of a CCP to provide ESMA with all relevant information and to enable on-site inspections, as well as the necessary safeguards confirming that such arrangements are valid in the third country. In the event that certain CCPs may be of particular systemic importance for the EU financial system, the Commission could, at the request of ESMA and in agreement with the relevant central bank, decide that a CCP will only be able to provide services in the Union if it establishes itself in the EU. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the impact of the legislative proposal on expenditure is as follows: (i) the hiring of 47 new temporary staff at ESMA (from August 2018); (ii) the cost of these new temporary agents will be fully financed by the fees raised from industry (no impact on the EU budget). As ESMA would however incur costs under the Regulation from the entry into force of the Regulation, there is a need to obtain additional budget from the EU in 2018 and 2019 in order to cover for at least the 12 first months of operations following the entry into force of the Regulation. The estimated impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 4 310 555 in 2018 and EUR 7 788 789 in 2019. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: newly listed small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are a key driver of investment and job creation. However, despite the benefits, EU public markets for SMEs are struggling to attract new issuers. The number of Initial Public Offerings on SME-dedicated markets steeply declined in the European Union in the wake of the crisis, and did not significantly pick up since. Between 2006 and 2007, an average of EUR 13.8 billion was raised annually on European SME-dedicated MTFs through Initial Public Offerings. This amount fell to EUR 2.55 billion on average from 2009 to 2017. The Commission considers that a regulatory framework still needs to be put in place to further facilitate SMEs' access to public savings. During the mid-term review of the Capital Market Union Action Plan in June 2017, the Commission reinforced the focus on SME access to public markets. Companies listed on an SME growth market are required to comply with certain EU rules, in particular Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse and Regulation (EU) No 2017/1129 on prospectuses. The Commission proposes to amend certain technical provisions of these two Regulations with a view to (i) reduce the administrative burden and the regulatory compliance costs faced by SMEs when their financial instruments are admitted to trading on an SME IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the alleviations under the Market Abuse Regulation should benefit to all companies listed on SME Growth Markets and not only to SMEs listed on those trading venues. : the proposed legislative amendments aim in particular at lowering the administrative burden and compliance costs faced by SME Growth Market issuers and resulting from the application of the Market Abuse Regulation and the Prospectus Regulation. This initiative also seeks to promote liquidity by ensuring that any SME Growth Market issuer in the EU can enter into a liquidity provision contract. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Exemption of negotiated private placements of bonds with institutional investors when (i) the issuer seeking a private placement of bonds already has its equity or non-equity financial instruments admitted to trading on an SME Growth Market; and (ii) if an alternative wall-crossing procedure is in place, by which any potential qualified investor acknowledges the regulatory duties stemming from the access to inside information. Creation of a European regime for liquidity provision contracts for SME Growth Market equity issuers while allowing National Competent Authorities to establish Accepted Market Practices. This would increase liquidity and reduce volatility of SME shares, thus increasing the attractiveness of SME Growth Markets for investors, intermediaries and exchanges. Justification of delayed inside information to be made only on request (and no need to keep a disclosure record). This would reduce the administrative burden on issuers present on SME growth markets by exempting them from the obligation to register a long list of information (statement of deferred information). Obligation to maintain a list of 'permanent insiders' : this would alleviate the burden on issuers, by avoiding the costs of drawing up an ad hoc list of insiders for each piece of inside information. The impact on the capacity of National Competent Authorities to detect insider trading would be minimal as they rarely rely on insider lists in practice. Adoption of a new deadline for the publication of transactions carried out by persons discharging managerial responsibilities within issuers of SME growth markets. Such persons shall declare their transactions to the issuer and the national competent authority within three working days. Thereafter, after such notification, the issuer shall have two additional days to publish the information. Creation of a lighter ‚Äòtransfer prospectus‚Äô for SME Growth Market issuers listed for at least three years when seeking a graduation to regulated market. A prospectus is a legally required document presenting information about a company when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 10 October 2011, the Council adopted a decision authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part. Negotiations began in December 2011 and were successfully concluded with the initialling of the Agreement on 5 March 2015. Pending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and Australia, are provisionally applied. The Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and Australia, a partnership which is based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties. Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of common foreign and security policy, common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part. In light of the above, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The purpose of the Agreement is ‚Äòto establish a strengthened Partnership between the Parties; to provide a framework to facilitate and promote cooperation across a broad range of areas of mutual interest; and to enhance cooperation to develop solutions to regional and global challenges‚Äô. The content of the Agreement covers three pillars: -political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU; -cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as : -sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of: -Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU‚Äôs relations with Australia."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 23 of the Convention provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. Following the sixth ratification, of which four were by Member States of the Council of Europe, Convention No. 196 came into force on 1 June 2007. As of 21 February 2017, 23 EU Member States have ratified the Convention, and all EU Member States have signed it. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. Given the global nature of terrorism, a common understanding of terrorist and terrorism-related offences, complemented with provisions to facilitate cooperation between national authorities as laid down in Convention No. 196 contributes to further enhancing the effectiveness of the criminal justice instruments and cooperation at Union and international level. The Union has already adopted measures in the different areas covered by Convention No. 196 on the basis of provisions of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. With the adoption of the Directive on combating terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. This can only be done by concluding Convention No. 196, at the latest simultaneously with conclusion of its Additional Protocol. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. It must be read together with a proposal concerning a decision to conclude the Additional Protocol (Convention No. 217) that supplements the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (Convention No. 196). Objectives of the Convention: Convention No. 196 defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has competence under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers areas to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, including the setting of minimum rules for the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism, as well as police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The purpose of Convention No. 196 is to enhance the efforts of the parties in preventing terrorism and its negative effects on the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to life, both by measures taken at national level and through international co-operation. It thus criminalises the following acts when committed intentionally: In addition, the Convention: Convention No. 196 also contains several provisions aiming at strengthening international co-operation in criminal matters through mutual legal assistance, including spontaneous exchange of information and extradition, being subject to a non-discrimination clause. An Additional Protocol (Convention No. 217) was adopted by the Council of Europe on 19 May 2015. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 and came into force on 1 July 2017. It is not possible to be a party to the Additional Protocol without also being a party to Convention No. 1963. The European Union has signed Convention No. 196, as well as its Additional Protocol. Territorial application: Convention No. 196 signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. Convention No. 196 signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision."

BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 10 of the Protocol provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. The Additional Protocol came into force on 1 July 2017. As of 11 July 2017, three EU Member States have ratified the Additional Protocol, and twenty-four EU Member States have signed it. The terrorist threat has grown and rapidly evolved in recent years. Foreign terrorist fighters have been linked to recent attacks and plots in several Member States. In addition, the Union and its Member States face increased threats from individuals who are inspired or instructed by terrorist groups abroad. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and defend the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The Union has already adopted measures in the area covered by the Additional Protocol, including substantive criminal law provisions as well as a provision on enhanced information exchange. With the adoption of the directive on the fight against terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 217). The present proposal is therefore accompanied by, and must be read together with, a proposal concerning a decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. Objectives of the Additional Protocol: the Protocol defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has jurisdiction under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, namely the setting of minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism (Article 83(1) TFEU) where consent by the European Parliament is required. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 with a series of provisions aimed at implementing the criminal law aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 2178(2014) on ‚ÄúThreats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts‚Äù. It seeks to prevent and curb the flow of foreign terrorist fighters to conflict zones and provide a common understanding of and response to foreign terrorist fighter-related offences, which serves as a benchmark for information exchange and facilitates cross-border investigations and prosecutions of acts of a preparatory nature having the potential and danger of leading to the commission of terrorist offences. The Additional Protocol thus provides for the criminalisation of the following acts: Contact point: the Additional Protocol requires the parties to designate a contact point for the 24/7 exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters. It is proposed to designate Europol as this contact point, under the conditions stipulated in Regulation (EU) 2016/794 on relations with partners and the transfer and exchange of personal data. Territorial application: the Additional Protocol signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. It is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision."

BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union‚Äôs economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aiming to amend Directive 1993/31/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1994/62/EC on package and packaging waste; Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators; Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‚Äòfit for purpose‚Äô; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction ‚Äì more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the targets laid down in Council Directive 1999/31/EC14 setting landfill restrictions to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy and make progress in the implementation of the Raw Materials Initiative by reducing landfilling of waste destined for landfills for non-hazardous waste. The main points are as follows: Alignment of definitions : it is proposed that municipal waste should be clearly defined in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. The definitions in Directives 1999/31/EC should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Reduction in landfill waste: Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of the target. In the event of an extension, the Member State should take the necessary measures to reduce by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 20% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. By 31 December 2024 at the latest , the Commission should examine the target with a view to reducing it and introducing restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. To this end, the Commission should send a report accompanied by a proposal, if appropriate, shall be sent to the European Parliament and the Council. The proposal prohibits the landfilling of biodegradable waste that has been separately collected."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: improving the transparency of Union law is an essential element of the Better Regulation agenda that the Union Institutions are pursuing also under the new Interinstitutional Agreement on better law making. The 2014 REFIT Communication announced that the Commission will prepare repeals of legislation, inter alia, in relation to standardised reporting in the area of environment. Moreover, the 2015 Better Regulation Communication called for a broad review of reporting in several policy areas including the environment. Given these links, the repeal of Council Directive 91/692/EEC on standardising and rationalising reports on the implementation of certain Directives relating to the environment (SRD) is now being addressed. In brief, the SRD aimed at streamlining the reporting obligations of all EU environmental legislation in effect at the time of its adoption. However in practice, not all environmental reporting requirements were harmonised by Directive 91/692/EEC. Moreover, the implementation of the Directive was burdensome and ineffective from the outset. Directive 91/692/EEC refers to 28 environmental acts covered by its provisions. The majority of the original obligations set out in Directive 91/692/EEC have become obsolete and have no legal effect anymore. The repeal package consists of four proposed initiatives related to the repeal of the SRD: a Communication which declares the obsolescence of 11 implementing acts adopted by the Commission to establish questionnaires for environmental reporting including Decision 95/337/EEC; two proposals for Commission Decisions repealing 2 of the implementing decisions (via comitology procedures), namely Commission Decision 2011/92/EU and Commission Decision 2010/681/EU that have exhausted their legal effect, but for procedural reasons will be repealed via a later comitology procedure by the Commission; proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision , which will repeal and amend provisions of the 6 legal acts referring to the SRD. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to: (i) amend Directive 87/217/EEC of the Council, Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Regulation (EU) No 1257/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Council Directive 86/278/EEC and Council Directive 94/63/EC as regards procedural rules in the field of environmental reporting and repealing Council Directive 91/692/EEC. The proposed amendments seek to remove requirements for standardised reporting. It is also proposed that references to the old comitology rules are replaced by Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission‚Äôs exercise of implementing powers. The proposal to repeal Directive 91/692/EEC and to remove obsolete provisions, while making reference to new rules on implementing acts, should ensure legal certainty, improve transparency, reduce administrative burden and ensure that EU legislation is ""fit for purpose"" in line with the Better Regulation agenda. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise unable to access printed material must have equal access to books and printed material in order to fully and effectively participate in society. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision. The World Blind Union reports that in Europe only 5% of published books are available in an accessible format for visually impaired persons, while in developing countries ‚Äì where approximately 90% of visually impaired people live ‚Äì this rate is as low as 1%. Since January 2011, the European Union has been bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This enshrines the right of access to information (Article 21) and the right of people with disabilities to participate in cultural life on an equal basis with others (Article 30). The Convention has become an integral part of the EU legal order. Twenty-five Member States are parties to the Convention and three countries are finalising ratification. In 2009, negotiations began in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) on a possible international treaty introducing limitations and exceptions to copyright for the benefit of people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled, with the objective of facilitating the cross-border exchange of books in accessible formats. On 26 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to participate in these negotiations, on behalf of the European Union. The WIPO negotiations were successfully concluded at the diplomatic conference held in Marrakesh between 17 and 28 June 2013. These led to the adoption of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled on 27 June 2013. The Council authorised the signature of the Treaty on behalf of the European Union on 14 April 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. Objectives of the Treaty: the Treaty establishes a set of international rules which ensure that there are limitations or exceptions to copyright at national level for the benefit of people who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled and enable the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies of published works that have been made under an exception or limitation to copyright in any of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty. Main provisions: Definition and scope: the Treaty defines: - the beneficiaries: they are people who are blind, have a visual impairment or a perceptual or reading disability, or are otherwise unable, due to physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book, or focus or move their eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading; - works: as literary and artistic works within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, in the form of text, notation and/or related illustrations, whether published or otherwise made publicly available in any media. By virtue of an agreed statement, this also covers audiobooks; - an accessible-format copy: as is a copy in an alternative manner and form compared to the format in which the work has been published and which gives beneficiaries access to the work as comfortably as sighted people could access it. The accessible-format copy must be used exclusively by beneficiaries and it must respect the integrity of the original work. Accessible format copies made under a limitation or exception to copyright may be exported by ‚Äòauthorised entities‚Äô, defined as government institutions or other organisations that provide education, instructional training, adaptive reading or information access to blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled persons on a non-profit basis. These entities must ensure that they only distribute accessible formats to beneficiaries, that they discourage the reproduction, distribution and making available of unauthorised copies and that they maintain due care in, and records of, their handling of the copies. Production obligations of accessible format copies: the Treaty obliges every Contracting Party to provide, in their national copyright laws, for a limitation or exception to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public, to facilitate the availability of works in accessible formats for the Treaty‚Äôs beneficiaries. Contracting Parties may decide to limit such limitations or exceptions to cases where accessible format copies are not commercially available on reasonable terms to beneficiaries in their territory. ‚ÄòThree-step test‚Äô: Contracting Parties may only allow accessible format copies to be exported, if they ensure that relevant limitations or exceptions to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public are subject to the ‚Äòthree-step test‚Äô. This means that either they must be a party to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) or they must otherwise ensure that the relevant limitations or exceptions are limited to certain special cases which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. Import authorisation: the Treaty clarifies that, to the extent a Contracting Party permits a beneficiary or an authorised entity to make an accessible-format copy of a work, it should also permit accessible-format copies to be imported. Contracting Parties are obliged to take appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure that when they provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures, this legal protection does not prevent the beneficiaries from enjoying the limitations and exceptions provided for in the Treaty. Protection of privacy: the Treaty also requires Contracting Parties to protect the privacy of beneficiaries and to cooperate in order to facilitate the cross-border exchange of accessible-format copies. WIPO will set up an information access point to assist authorised entities in identifying one another with a view to working together. The Treaty also encourages authorised entities to provide information on their policies and practices to interested parties and to members of the public. Ratification procedure and entry into force: the Treaty confirms that Contracting Parties are free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the Treaty within their own legal system and practice. However, they must comply with existing international obligations under the Berne Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT). The Treaty will enter into force once twenty Contracting Parties have ratified it. Other specific provisions: the Treaty also: Competence of the EU: the EU may become a party to the Treaty, having made the declaration during the Marrakesh diplomatic conference, that it is competent in respect of, and has its own legislation binding on all its Member States on matters covered by this Treaty and that it has been duly authorised, in accordance with its internal procedures, to become party to the Treaty. The European Union signed the final act of the diplomatic conference on 28 June 2013 and signed the Treaty on 30 April 2014 in Geneva."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Vietnam, based on the November 2004 authorisation for negotiations with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with Vietnam were launched in Hanoi in November 2007. The PCA was signed in Brussels on 27 June 2012. The PCA with Vietnam will supersede the current legal framework of the 1995 Agreement between the European Community and Vietnam and the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was extended in 1999 to include Vietnam. It is now necessary to approve the PCA on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: the Commission notes that Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines is the subject of Court Case C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul this Decision insofar as the Council had added legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100 TFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4) TFEU). Council Decision No 2012/279/EU on the signature of the PCA Vietnam raises, mutatis mutandis, the same legal issues as Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines. Court Case C-377/12 is therefore of relevance to the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA with Vietnam too. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA Vietnam is based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6). The PCA draws the attention of the Council to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The addition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on the outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice, this recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The Commission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure for conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Viet Nam, of the other part. General principles and political dialogue: the PCA with Vietnam constitutes an important step towards enhanced political and economic involvement of the EU in South-East Asia. Foreign policy: the draft PCA covers the EU‚Äôs standard political clauses on: It also addresses legal cooperation, money laundering and terrorist financing, organised crime and corruption, and covers areas of particular interest to Vietnam such as cooperation on human rights and the rule of law, remnants of war and natural disaster prevention. Economic and trade cooperation: the draft PCA provides the basis for more effective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Vietnam in the development, trade and economic fields and will facilitate the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Vietnam. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries. Sectoral cooperation: the PCA strengthens the sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as: Institutional framework: the draft Agreement also includes institutional provisions to put in place a joint committee composed of representatives of the two Parties with the aim of ensuring the correct application of the Agreement and resolving conflicts."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova. That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. In the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the Eastern Partnership, Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union. The Association Agreement, including the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the Union and Moldova was signed on 27 June 2014 and will apply provisionally from 1 September 2014. The specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015. Recently Moldova has experienced and continues to experience difficulties with its fruit and vegetables exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the government of Moldova. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the horticultural sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 250 000 people (i.e. around 10% of the active population). Moreover, horticultural export levels have fallen in recent years. Taking into consideration the current temporary severe difficulties in accessing Moldova's traditional export markets for a number of products, the European Commission proposes to increase temporarily its fully liberalised market access for imports of these products from Moldova, allowing their commercialisation in the Union. CONTENT: in order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement, the proposed amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces three new duty free tariff quotas for fresh apples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums. As the Autonomous Trade Preference scheme expires at the end of 2015, this amendment provides for a time-limited response to the immediate needs for the key export products adversely affected (i.e. apples, plums and table grapes). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment to the Regulation incurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports from Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU. Whereas about 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU duty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under entry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than 0.01% of the total EU imports from the world of these products. The corresponding loss of tariff revenue should therefore have a limited impact on the EU‚Äôs own resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 17 July 2014 the negotiations were concluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concluded between the EU and Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement was initialled between the parties. In order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption pending the completion of the procedures for the approval and application of the Protocol of Accession, it is necessary to ensure that customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased and that no new customs duties are applied on products originating in Ecuador. To this end, the proposed Regulation provides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates that were applicable to Ecuador on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to put in place an interim reciprocal arrangement for the establishment of a free-trade area with Ecuador in order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption, following the initialling of the Protocol of Accession. As from 1 January 2015 , customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased nor new customs duties applied on products originating in Ecuador. Duration of the application : the Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2015. It shall expire six months after the Protocol of Accession enters into force or, where appropriate, is applied provisionally, or on 31 December 2016, whichever occurs first. Condition for the application : Ecuador should abstain from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effect or new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect for imports originating in the Union, or from increasing existing levels of duties or charges or from introducing any other restrictions from [the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession]. Ecuador should also: maintain its commitment to core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance; be subject to benefit from the tariff treatment provided under this Regulation should be conditional on compliance by Ecuador with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto. In the event of failure to comply with any of the conditions laid down in this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to suspend temporarily in whole or in part the tariff treatment provided therein. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal maintains the current market access arrangements and in this sense does not have any additional financial implications for the EU budget. The absence of its application would, however, entail a potential increase in the customs revenue collection. The amount of this customs revenue collection is difficult to predict, but would in any case be relatively small. The duty savings incurred by current market access regime enjoyed by Ecuador and which lapses on 1 January 2015 are in the range of EUR 215 million (based on 2013 trade figures)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of Title V acquis and therefore does not participate in the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013, which allows law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. On 8 March 2006, the Agreement between the European Community and Denmark concerning the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and the 'Eurodac' system for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention was concluded. However, access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes does not fall within the scope of that agreement. At a meeting on 14 May 2014 with representatives of the Commission, Denmark and the associated countries confirmed their interest in entering into negotiations with the European Union to extend the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to them via an international agreement. The negotiations have been finalised and an Agreement in the form of a Protocol to the Agreement of 8 March 2006, extending the application of the Agreement of 8 March 2006 to law enforcement was initialled. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision aims to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention, extending that agreement to law enforcement. The Protocol establishes the application of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to Denmark regarding access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes. The Protocol: - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of the other participating States and Europol to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by Denmark when trying to establish the identity of, or obtain more information on, a terrorist or serious crime suspect;; - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of Denmark to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by the other participating States; - guarantees that the current EU level of protection of personal data is applicable to the processing of personal data pursuant to the Protocol by the authorities of Denmark and of the Member States; - conditions the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes by Denmark by prior legal and technical implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA with regard to dactyloscopic data. The Protocol provides that the mechanisms regarding amendments provided for in the Agreement of 8 March 2006 should apply to all amendments regarding the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: within the single market, the free movement of goods generates around 25% of EU GDP and 75% of intra-EU trade. However, much remains to be done to achieve a deep and fair European Single Market. The increasing number of illegal and non-compliant products on the market distorts competition and puts consumers at risk. The evaluation of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 indicated that it has been only partly effective in achieving its specific and strategic objectives. This is mainly because coordination and cooperation have still not reached a satisfactory level. Tools such as the Union Rapid Alert System for dangerous non-food products (RAPEX) and the Information and Communication System on Market Surveillance (ICSMS) are in place to ensure cross-border market surveillance cooperation, but they are not sufficiently used by Member States. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 is not yet uniformly applied, due to the significant differences in how Member States implement it. This concerns the organisation of market surveillance at national level, the availability of financial, human and technical resources, the strategies of market surveillance, the powers of inspection and of sanctions and the systems of monitoring and reporting. Lastly, border controls on imported products seem insufficient. As announced by the Commission in the 2017 work programme, the initiative aims to address the growing number of non-compliant products on the Union market, while offering incentives to boost compliance with the regulation and ensure fair and equal treatment that will benefit businesses and citizens. In particular, it provides for appropriate incentives for businesses, increased compliance checks and enhanced cross-border law enforcement cooperation. IMPACT ANALYSIS: the preferred option is to improve existing tools and cooperation mechanisms. In addition, effective enforcement strategies deployed by Member States that include control activities and capacity building at the national level require the establishment of a Union product compliance network. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal for a Regulation on compliance with and enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products is to contribute to a deeper and fairer internal market for goods by promoting greater cooperation between national market surveillance authorities. In concrete terms, the proposal: introduces the concept of a ‚Äòperson responsible for compliance information established within the Union‚Äô as a necessary condition for making the products available on the market. The person responsible for compliance information can be the manufacturer, the importer or any other economic operator designated by the manufacturer. The tasks of the person responsible for compliance information are essentially to provide information on the product to market surveillance authorities and to cooperate with the authorities; defines how to designate competent authorities and single liaison offices for this Regulation and clarifies the roles of the single liaison offices; sets out the Member States‚Äô obligations as regards organisation of market surveillance within their territory and lays down the procedures they must establish to follow up complaints or issues relating to risks; monitor accidents and harm to the health of end-users; verify corrective actions taken by economic operators; and follow up scientific and technical knowledge of safety issues; provides for a set of powers for market surveillance authorities, defined with the view to ensure effective enforcement of Union harmonisation legislation on products is enforced effectively across borders. These powers include the power to access data and documents related to an instance of non-compliance, to require economic operators and public entities to provide all information related to an instance of non-compliance; to carry out on sit inspections; to initiate investigations or procedures aimed at ceasing non-compliance; to prohibit the supply of products, or withdraw and recall and destroy them; to impose penalties and order the recovery of profits obtained as a result of non-compliance; and to publish decisions; provides for the exchange of information on illegal products and on-going investigations so that governments can take effective action against non-compliant products; imposes stricter mutual assistance obligations and the legal presumption that products declared to be non-compliant in one Member State are also non-compliant across the EU; provides for a strengthened framework for controls on products entering the Union market and strengthens the exchange of information between market surveillance authorities and customs authorities, in particular through procedures for releasing products, suspending and refusing of release for free circulation; establishes a Union product compliance network (the network) within the Commission to coordinate enforcement tasks, thereby boosting market surveillance cooperation at EU level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal requires human and administrative resources, as well as operational appropriations. The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 12.576 million up to the year 2020 inclusive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: online platforms are key enablers of digital trade. At present, more than a million EU enterprises trade through online platforms in order to reach their customers, and it is estimated that around 60% of private consumption and 30% of public consumption of goods and services related to the total digital economy are transacted via online intermediaries. The growing intermediation of transactions through online intermediation services, fuelled by strong data-driven indirect network effects, lead to an increased dependence of such business users, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, on those services in order for them to reach consumers. The dependence of businesses on certain online services implies that the providers of such online intermediation services have a scope to engage in a number of potentially harmful trading practices which limit business users' sales through them and risk undermining their trust, notably: unexplained changes in terms and conditions without prior notice; the delisting of goods or services and the suspension of accounts without a clear statement of reasons; lack of transparency related to the ranking of goods and services and of the undertakings offering them; unclear conditions for access to, and use of, data collected by providers. Furthermore, online general search engines exhibit a dependency-enabled issue, specifically for potentially harmful ranking practices, which may affect business users. Building on extensive stakeholder consultation, this initiative contributes to the objectives of the digital single market strategy by creating a clear, transparent and stable legal environment for online B2C service providers and their business users, in order to combat market fragmentation and ensure that businesses using online intermediation services have access to redress opportunities throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the optimal policy choice aims to provide legally binding transparency and redress obligations on the full range of potentially harmful trading practices identified as part of this initiative, including transparency for the issue of ranking in online general search. The Commission considers that the proposal should be capable of reversing a dampening effect on the online platform economy resulting from a lack of trust of business users amounting to at least between EUR 810 million and EUR 4 billion. CONTENT: the proposed new Regulation: lays down obligations for providers of online intermediation services and, in certain respects, online search engines to provide business users and corporate website users, respectively, with appropriate transparency and to offer them certain redress possibilities; obliges providers of online intermediation services to ensure that their terms and conditions: (i) are drafted in clear and unambiguous language; (ii) are easily available for business users; (iii) set out the objective grounds for decisions to suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, the provision of their online intermediation services to business users; establishes requirements for a statement of reasons from a provider of online intermediation services if it suspends or terminates the use by a business user of its intermediation services; establishes requirements for a description of the main parameters determining ranking of business users in search results, including a description where ranking is influenced by the business user giving direct or indirect remuneration to them, in the terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement to include a description of the access to personal data or other data which business users or consumers provide to online intermediation services or which are generated through those services, in the standard terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement for providers of online intermediation services to list in their terms and conditions one or more mediators with which the provider is willing to engage to reach an agreement out of court on a dispute, for instance where an issue has not been resolved by the internal complaint handling system; establishes a requirement for the Commission to encourage providers of online intermediation services to individually or jointly set up one or more independent mediator organisations to facilitate the settlement, out of court, of disputes that arise in the course of online intermediation services, particularly given their cross-border nature; establishes a right for judicial proceedings to be brought by representative organisations, associations or public bodies to stop or prohibit any non-compliance by providers of online intermediation services with the requirements contained in the Regulation."
4962,314,226.0,1.0,17.04.2019,Supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products,***I,Leg,Draft legislative resolution,s,Grandes Pascual,A8-0039/2019,2018/0161/COD,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/A-8-2019-0039_EN.html?redirect,Committee on Legal Affairs,Legal Affairs,Provisional agreement ,0.0,32,committee,RCV,+,572,63,22,0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,1.0,1.0,35.0,0.0,0.083,0.0,0.0,0.115,0.015,0.005,0.673,0,0,0,0,https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2018/0161(COD),https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/summary.do?id=1535555&t=e&l=en,"PURPOSE: to amend Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products. PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a supplementary protection certificate (SPC) is an intellectual property right available in EU Member States that extends by up to five years the legal effects of a reference patent on a medicinal product that has been authorised by national or European regulatory authorities. A harmonised SPC system is sought to compensate for the loss of effective patent protection due to the time required in order to obtain marketing authorisation (including research and clinical trials). The EU legislation applicable to SPCs on medicinal products is Regulation (EC) No 469/2009. Reliance on SPC protection is significant and increasing. At the same time however, EU and global pharmaceutical markets are undergoing profound changes. Global demand for medicines has increased massively. Alongside this, there is a shift towards an ever-greater market share for generics and biosimilars. Although the EU has been a hub for pharmaceutical research and development (R&D) and production, its competitive position is under threat today. While Europe‚Äôs trading partners are increasingly involved in the manufacturing of generics and biosimilars, EU-based manufacturers of generics and/or biosimilars face a significant problem: during the SPC period of protection of the product in the EU, they cannot manufacture for any purpose, including export outside the EU to countries where SPC protection has expired or does not exist, while manufacturers based in those non-EU countries can do so. This competitive disadvantage entails a risk of delocalisation of manufacturing outside of Europe, loss of investment opportunities, and a brake on further innovation and job creation in Europe. The certificate also makes it more difficult for EU manufacturers to enter the EU market immediately after its expiry, given that they are not in a position to build up production capacity until the protection provided by the certificate has lapsed. The Commission proposed to amend the Union‚Äôs legislation on Supplementary Protection Certificates for medicinal products by introducing a so-called manufacturing exemption for export purposes (manufacturing waiver). In its resolution of 26 May 2016 on the single market strategy, the European Parliament endorsed the need to take action on the EU SPC regime and urged the Commission to introduce and implement by 2019 an SPC manufacturing waiver to boost the competitiveness of the generics and biosimilars sector, but without undermining the market exclusivity granted under the SPC regime in protected markets. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is the introduction of a targeted and narrow exception to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009. This option is expected to enhance the competitiveness of EU-based generic and biosimilars manufacturers in terms of exports during the SPC term, resulting in additional net sales of EU pharmaceuticals of up to EUR 1 billion per year. EU patients and health authorities would benefit from a strengthened and more timely supply of medicines (e.g. in terms of diversification of the supply). Additional savings to public spending in Member States on pharmaceuticals, potentially of the order of upwards of 4%, could materialise from increased competition between generics and biosimilars manufacturers in EU markets following SPC expiry in the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes a targeted amendment to Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 on the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products. Concretely, the proposal: it introduces an exception , to enable manufacturers of generics and biosimilars to manufacture such medicines for the purpose of exporting them outside the EU during the SPC protection term. This waiver will remove the competitive disadvantages EU-based manufacturers of generics and biosimilars are currently facing. This proposal leaves SPC protection fully intact as regards placing products on the EU market. SPC holders will keep their market exclusivity in Member States during the full SPC protection term; provides for ‚Äòanti-diversion‚Äô safeguards , notably a requirement to notify, ex ante, such manufacturing to independent national public bodies (which will hold the relevant information in a publicly accessible register) along with labelling requirements for products that are exported and due diligence requirements on the manufacturer vis-√†-vis persons in its supply chain; makes the exception subject to the following conditions : the exception will apply only to SPCs that have not yet been granted, and only after a transitional period to accommodate pending applications. This transition will allow market players to take account of the new situation when making investment decisions. It will also give national authorities enough time to set up their arrangements for receiving notifications of the intention to make use of the manufacturing waiver."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union‚Äôs space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‚ÄòGOVSATCOM‚Äô. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union‚Äôs role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the digital single market strategy established a robust framework which must now be matched with an equally ambitious investment programme to increase the EU's international competitiveness, as well as to develop and strengthen Europe's strategic digital capacities. European Heads of State and Government identified the main pillars of a strong digital economy: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, a world class infrastructure that includes high performance computing, digital skills, and the digital transformation of the public sector. In its resolution of 1 June 2017 on the digitising European industry, the European Parliament highlighted the importance of a common European cybersecurity approach, recognising the need to raise awareness and considered cyber-resilience as a crucial responsibility for business leaders and national and European industrial security policymakers. The digital Europe programme is a central element of the Commission's comprehensive response to the challenge of digital transformation, part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal for 2021-2027. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the digital Europe programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021 - 2027, the forms of European Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The overall objective of the proposed programme is to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and bring its benefits to European citizens and businesses. It shall reinforce Europe's capacities in key digital technology areas through large-scale deployment and widen their diffusion and uptake in areas of public interest and the private sector. The programme has five specific objectives: 1. high-performance computing : funding aims to build-up and strengthen the EU's high performance computing (HPC) and data processing capacities, and ensure their wide use both in areas of public interest such as health, environment and security, and by industry, notably SMEs. At EU level, in March 2017, 29 countries engaged to cooperate on connected mobility, and 16 Member States have committed so far to work together and with the Commission to acquire and deploy an integrated world-class high performance computing infrastructure. In January 2018, the Commission proposed a Council Regulation to establish the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking ‚ÄòEuroHPC‚Äô. The continuation of the Joint Undertaking is deemed to be the most effective instrument to implement the objectives of the EuroHPC initiative, in particular to coordinate national and European Union strategies and investments in high performance computing infrastructure and R&D; 2. cybersecurity : the programme shall contribute to the protection of the EU digital economy, society and democracies by promoting the EU cyber defence and cyber security industry, financing advanced cyber security equipment and infrastructure, and supporting the development of the necessary skills and knowledge. 3. artificial intelligence : the aim is to build-up and reinforce core artificial intelligence (AI) capacities such as a data resources and libraries of artificial intelligence algorithms and make them accessible to all businesses and public administrations, as well as reinforce and foster links between existing artificial intelligence testing and experimentation facilities in Member States; 4. advanced digital skills : the programme shall ensure that the current and future labour force can easily acquire advanced digital skills, notably in high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, by offering students, graduates, and existing workers the means to acquire and develop these skills, no matter where they are situated; 5. deployment, better use of digital capacities and interoperability : the objective is to expand the best use of digital capacities, notably high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, across the economy, in areas of public interest and society, including the deployment of interoperable solutions in areas of public interest and facilitate access to technology and knowhow for all businesses, notably SMEs. Digital innovation hubs : the proposal foresees a central role for digital innovation hubs in the implementation of the programme. A network of digital innovation hubs shall ensure the widest geographical coverage across Europe. The digital innovation hubs shall serve as access points to the latest digital capacities, including high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, as well as other innovative technologies such as key enabling technologies, also available also in fablabs or citylabs.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fiscalis 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of Member States of the Union and of taxpayers, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The Union and the national tax authorities still suffer from insufficient capacity and insufficient cooperation ‚Äì both within the EU and with third countries ‚Äì to carry out effectively and efficiently their missions. They need to provide quick and joint responses to emerging problems such as tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, digitalisation and new business models, while at the same time preventing unnecessary administrative burden for citizens and businesses in cross-border transactions. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a new fiscalis programme under the Single Market, Innovation and Digital budget heading. It shall comprise means and a budget which shall support tax policy and tax authorities through administrative and IT capacity building activities and operational cooperation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the Fiscalis 2020 programme. Objective : the programme has the general objective to support tax authorities and taxation to enhance the functioning of the single market, foster Union competitiveness and protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States. It supports tax policy, tax cooperation and administrative capacity building, including human competency and the development and operation of the European electronic systems. The programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The implementation of the programme will occur through the most commonly used spending mechanisms of Union budget, namely public procurement and grants. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation provides mechanisms, means as well as the necessary funding aiming to support tax policy and to improve cooperation between tax authorities. The proposed measure comprises inter alia meetings and similar ad-hoc events, project-based structured collaboration and human competency and capacity building actions, in which Member States and their officials may participate on a voluntary basis. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of common components and national components reflecting better the reality of IT projects and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand, and the Member States on the other hand, have been listed A multi-annual strategic plan for taxation to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure jointly the development and operation, including the design, specification, conformance testing, deployment, maintenance, evolution, security, quality assurance and quality control, of the European electronic systems listed in the multi-annual strategic plan for taxation. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 270 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

The Treaty of Lisbon has substantially modified the legal framework governing the powers conferred on the Commission by the legislator, introducing a clear distinction between powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts). The proposed Regulation aims to adapt a series of basic instruments where the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) applies to make them evolve into delegated acts. The European Parliament‚Äôs position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission's proposal to clarify that the power to adopt delegated acts would be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years. The Commission shall prepare a report on the delegation of authority no later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council objects to such an extension no later than three months before the end of each period. In a recital, Parliament pointed out that bundling and presenting empowerments that are not closely linked with each other within a single delegated act of the Commission impedes the exercise of Parliament's right of scrutiny, as it is forced to simply accept or refuse the entire delegated act, which leaves no room to express an opinion on each empowerment individually."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty of Lisbon introduced a distinction between the following: powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), as referred to in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning pf the EU; and powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts) as referred to in Article 291 of the Treaty. The measures which may be covered by delegations of powers correspond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC. This procedure still appears in the basic acts covered by this proposal and continues to apply in those acts until they are formally amended and adapted to the Lisbon Treaty. The Commission made three horizontal alignment legislative proposals in 2013 (Omnibus I, Omnibus II and Omnibus III). The European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on 25 February 2014, broadly agreeing with the proposals by the Commission. The Council, however, did not support the Commission proposals, due to the absence of stronger guarantees that Member State experts would be systematically consulted in the preparation of delegated acts. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission subsequently agreed on a new framework for delegated acts in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (IAA) and acknowledged the need to align all existing legislation to the legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, they agreed on the need to give high priority to the prompt alignment of all basic acts that still refer to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. CONTENT: the proposal aligns three basic acts to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, these acts being: Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters; Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims; Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation No 1348/2000. The alignment clauses reflect the following points in the IAA: they now provide for a clear commitment to a systematic consultation of experts from the Member States in the preparation of delegated acts. This fulfils a key condition for a successful second attempt to align the old regulatory procedure with scrutiny provisions to the Lisbon Treaty. This commitment is now explicitly included in the new standard clauses; they recognise the important role of early cooperation and exchange of views with the European Parliament in relation to delegated acts. The European Parliament must receive all documents at the same time as Member State experts, including the draft delegated acts, and the alignment clauses provide for systematic access of European Parliament experts to the meetings of Commission expert groups preparing delegated acts. Accordingly, to each basic act a number of amendments are made, and references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny are deleted. As regards the duration of the empowerment the Commission proposes empowerments with an indeterminate duration, since the legislator has the possibility of revoking an empowerment in all cases and at any time. Acts on which individual legislative proposals have been made in the meantime are not included in the proposal. This concerns two acts in the area of justice: Regulation (EC) No. 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007 establishing a European small claims procedure. These have been aligned in the meantime been aligned by Regulation (EU) 2015/2421. This proposal is linked to the proposal on adapting a number of legal acts to Article 290 and 291 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and Russia was signed in Brussels on 16 November 2000 and entered into force on 10 May 2001. The Agreement is renewable by common agreement between the parties for additional periods of five-years. The Agreement has been renewed three times, in 2004, 2009 and 2014, for an additional period of five years each time. The current Agreement expired on 20 February 2019. Both parties confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for an additional period of five years without any amendments. CONTENT: under the draft Council Decision, the renewal of the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation for an additional period of five years would be approved on behalf of the European Union. The substance of the renewed Agreement will be identical to that of the current Agreement as discussed and agreed with the Russian counterparts. It will not create new rights and obligations for the EU, but instead it will extend in time the legal regime already existing between the Parties in the field of science and technology cooperation. The renewal of the Agreement fits within the EU's approach based on the five guiding principles to manage the EU‚Äôs current relations with Russia, agreed upon at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 14 March 2016 and confirmed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 16 April 2018. The Agreement provides a framework to enhance people-to-people contacts and science, technology and innovation cooperation in areas of EU strategic interest in the years to come, countering the trend of decreasing intensity of scientific collaboration between EU and Russian participants."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1979, the Union has been a party to the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries (the NAFO Convention). NAFO has the authority to adopt legally-binding decisions for the conservation of fisheries resources under its purview. Upon their entry into force, the NAFO conservation and enforcement measures (ECMs) are binding on all NAFO Contracting Parties and, in the case of the Union, are to be incorporated into Union law to the extent to which they are not already covered by Union law. An amendment to the NAFO Convention was adopted on 28 September 2007 and approved by Council Decision 2010/717/EU. Council Regulation (EC) No 1386/2007 transposed the NAFO conservation and enforcement measures into Union law. The NAFO conservation and enforcement measures were amended by every annual meeting of NAFO Contracting Parties from 2008 onwards. These new provisions need to be incorporated in the Union law; including for conservation measures for certain species, protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems, inspection procedures at sea and in port, vessels requirements, monitoring of fishing activities and additional Port State measures. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation seeks to transpose into Union law the conservation and enforcement measures adopted by the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) which are binding on the Contracting Parties with a view to their uniform and effective implementation within the Union. Council Regulations (EC) No 2115/2005 and (EC) No 1386/2007 would be repealed. The proposal covers conservation and management measures, including provisions on catch limitations, closure of fisheries, transfer of quotas and by-catches. It also contains provisions on: mesh size, marking of gear, minimum size of fish, and management measures for Northern prawns, skate, Greenland halibut and sharks; the protection of vulnerable marine ecosystems in the NAFO Regulatory Area, including area restrictions on bottom fishing activities and conditions for bottom fishing in new areas; lists of vessels, vessel markings, and chartering arrangements; the rules on monitoring and reporting catches, product labelling, vessel monitoring systems and transhipments; the observer scheme, including rules on the observer programme and on electronic reporting; inspection and surveillance at sea in the NAFO Regulatory Area. It lays down general rules for inspection and surveillance, sets out provisions for inspections and surveillance procedures and covers the provisions on infringements and serious infringements; port state control, including reporting obligations with regard to designated ports and points of contact, provisions on notification for entry into port and authorisations to land or tranship; reporting obligations with regard to port inspections; fishing vessels from countries that are not contracting parties to NAFO, including provisions on presumption of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) activities, sighting and inspection at sea and in port, provisional IUU vessels list and actions against vessels IUU listed vessels. The proposal also legislates on the existing practice of notifications by the Commission and the European Fisheries Control Agency to the NAFO Executive Secretary containing information on EU-flagged fishing vessels. Given that NAFO's ERMs are amended each year, the proposal provides for delegated powers granted to the Commission under Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), to cater for amendments to measures, which are expected to be frequent."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its action plan of February 2016 on strengthening the fight against terrorist financing, the Commission undertook to explore the possibility of a dedicated legal instrument to broaden the access to centralised bank account registries by Member States' authorities. Lack of financial information may result in missed opportunities to investigate serious crimes, disrupt criminal activities, stop terrorist plots, and detect and freeze proceeds of crime. The current mechanisms for accessing and exchanging financial information are slow compared to the fast pace at which funds can be transferred across Europe and globally. Too much time is required to obtain financial information, reducing the effectiveness of investigations and prosecutions. The Union co-legislators agreed in December 2017 on a number of significant changes to the 4th Anti Money Laundering Directive. They include the mandatory establishment of national centralised bank account registries or data retrieval systems in all Member States, to which Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and anti-money laundering authorities would have access. These Directives mostly deal with preventive efforts to address money laundering, and terrorist financing. They do not, however, set out the precise conditions under which Member States' competent authorities may use financial and other information for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of certain criminal offences. Most competent authorities currently do not have direct access to the information on the identity of bank account holders, held in the centralised bank account registries or data retrieval systems. They usually request the information either via blanket requests sent to all financial institutions in their Member State or, if they have been granted indirect access, via a request to an intermediary. Blanket requests carry the real risk of significant delays and also has implications for cross-border cooperation IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment assessed ways to expand access to financial information for competent authorities for the investigation of crimes and examined a number of options. The preferred option is the adoption of an EU legislative instrument which would give direct access to competent authorities for the purposes of criminal investigations. CONTENT: this proposal provides for: direct access to the national centralised bank account registries or data retrieval systems to competent authorities, which include tax authorities, anti-corruption authorities and Asset Recovery Offices. These bodies will have direct access on a case-by-case basis to bank account information contained in national, centralised registries enabling the authorities to identify in which banks a suspect holds accounts. Data protection safeguards ensure that only limited information on the identity of the bank account holder would be made available; cooperation between Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and between FIUs and competent authorities. It defines the type of information (financial information, financial analysis, law enforcement information) that may be requested by competent authorities and FIUs respectively as well as the exhaustive list of criminal offences for which each authority can exchange information on a case-by-case basis. Member States are required to designate all the competent authorities entitled to request information. Europol will be provided with indirect access through Member States' National Units. The decentralised computer network FIU.net, which is managed by Europol since 1 January 2016, will be used for exchanges of information between Financial Intelligence Units. The proposed Directive is in line with the reformed data protection regime, stemming from Directive (EU) 2016/680 (the General Data Protection Directive)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households‚Äô access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Decision (EU) 2017/1324 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for the participation of the Union in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The strategic objective of PRIMA is to build research and innovation capacities and to develop knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems in order to make them sustainable, as well as for an integrated water supply and management in the Mediterranean area. PRIMA will be jointly undertaken by a number of Member States and third countries with a high level of commitment to scientific, management and financial integration and under the same terms and conditions. Lebanon expressed its wish to join PRIMA as a Participating State and pledged to commit a financial contribution of EUR 7 million to the initiative. The negotiations started on 26 June 2017 and were successfully completed on 27 July 2017, when the text of the draft Agreement was initialled by representatives from each of the future Parties. In order to ensure that Lebanon participates in PRIMA on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020, an International Agreement with the Union is required to extend the scope of the legal regime established by Decision (EU) 2017/1324 to Lebanon. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council conclude the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Lebanon setting out the terms and conditions for participation of Lebanon in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The present initiative will allow Lebanon to become a Participating State in PRIMA, and thus engaged on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020. Lebanese legal entities would be automatically eligible to apply for EU funding in projects funded from the EU budget. In order to ensure the protection of Union financial interests, particularly the powers of the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the Court of Auditors and the PRIMA Implementation Structure (PRIMA-IS) to carry out audits and investigations, the Agreement and obliges the Parties to provide all necessary assistance to ensure their implementation and agree on detailed arrangements for assistance.

The period of application of that Protocol expired on 27 January 2017. A new protocol must now be approved on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving on behalf of the Union the new Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritius. The objective of this Protocol is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Mauritius to promote a sustainable fisheries policy, sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Mauritius waters and support Mauritius in the development of its sustainable ocean economy.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the EU and Norway are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the contracting Parties undertake to continue their efforts to achieve progressive liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters liberalising trade in agricultural products between Norway and the European Union was signed on 15 April 2011. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations in two years‚Äô time. The 2011 EU-Norway bilateral agricultural trade agreement increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Norwegian market to around 60 % of trade. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products; (iv) addressing certain pending trade irritants. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Norway concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, vegetables and ornamental plants, additional or new tariff quotas have been agreed upon. The deepening of trade relations with Norway fits into the overall context of EU trade policy and is beneficial for the EU since the EU is a net exporter of basic agricultural products to Norway. The main products exported by the EU are wines and vinegar, animal feed, soya and colza oil, live plants and cheese. Imports into the EU from Norway are mainly soybean, animal and vegetable oils and their residues, fur skins and undenatured ethyl alcohol. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Norway will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU, Euratom) No. 1141/2014 establishes a specific European legal status for European political parties and political foundations to benefit from and provides for their funding from the general budget of the European Union. It was introduced to increase the visibility, recognition, effectiveness, transparency and accountability of European political parties and their affiliated political foundations. Despite the progress made by Regulation No 1141/2014, the European Parliament and a number of European political parties have called for an improvement of these rules. On 15 June 2017, Parliament adopted a resolution calling upon the Commission to propose a revision of the current legal framework as soon as possible to address its shortcomings, especially with respect to the level of co-financing requested, and of the possibility of multi-party membership of European Parliaments' Members. In its 2017 Report on EU Citizenship Rights, the Commission recognised that the functioning of the EU is founded on representative democracy. This requires transparency and an accessible, accountable political culture, supported by an effective electoral system and an informed and engaged electorate. The current proposal is aligned to and complements these priorities and in addition to the issues set out in the previous section therefore includes some changes to enhance the transparency of the link between parties at Member State level and the European parties with which they are affiliated. The aim is to ensure that the limited resources of the EU budget are well allocated and spent, as well as avoiding circumvention of existing rules. The Commission considers that these focused changes should be introduced before the 2019 European elections. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to make a limited number of amendments to Regulation No 1141/2014 in order to: determine who can sponsor the registration of a political party, allocate funds in a way that is more proportionate to the representativeness of European political parties in the European Parliament, address difficulties faced by European political parties and foundations in reaching the co-financing threshold. The main elements of the proposal are: Registration : in order to strengthen the link between policies at national and Union level and to prevent a single national party artificially creating several European political parties with identical or similar political trends, the Commission proposes to amend the rules so that only parties, and no longer individuals, can sponsor the creation of a European political party. Co-financing : European foundations and political parties are currently struggling to meet the co-financing threshold of 15%. The Commission therefore proposes that the co-financing obligation should be reduced to 10% for European political parties and 5% for European political foundations. Thus, a greater share of public funding earmarked for these parties and foundations could be used, for example for election campaigns. Transparency : it is proposed to impose an additional condition for a European political party to receive funding, which would require it to report on the publication, on its member parties' websites, of its political programme and logo as well as and information on the gender representation among the candidates at the last elections to the European Parliament and its members of the European Parliament. Proportionality of EU funding : the allocation of resources from the general budget of the European Union should objectively reflect the genuine electoral support of a European political party. To this end, the Commission proposes that the respective appropriations available to those European political parties and European political foundations which have been awarded contributions or grants shall be distributed annually on the basis of the following distribution key: (i) 5 % shall be distributed in equal shares among the beneficiary European political parties; (ii) 95 % shall be distributed in proportion to their share of elected members of the European Parliament among the beneficiary European political parties. De-registration : the proposal provides for the possibility of de-registering a European political party or foundation if they no longer fulfil the conditions for registration or if the information on the basis of which the registration decision was taken is incorrect or misleading. Protection of the EU‚Äôs financial interests : in the event of infringements, the authorising officer of the European Parliament should be able to recover amounts unduly paid. Review : the Commission proposes to adapt the revision clause of the current Regulation so that the evaluation report can be published during the first part of 2022 and may therefore also relate to the amendments proposed in this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the western Mediterranean is one of the most developed sub-regions in terms of fisheries in the Mediterranean. It accounts for around 31 % of its total landing (EUR 1.35 billion out of a total of EUR 4.76 billion) and around 19 % of the officially reported Mediterranean fishing fleet. Demersal fisheries are highly sought after by fishermen due to their high commercial value. Demersal fisheries in the Mediterranean are highly complex and involve many species of fish and crustaceans. The main demersal species caught in the western Mediterranean are hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp and Norway lobster. The main gear used for demersal species are trawl nets, which have the largest catch and fleet power, but passive gears such as trammel nets, gillnets, traps and longlines are also important. Demersal fisheries in the western Mediterranean are currently managed through national management plans adopted under Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 (the ‚ÄòMedReg‚Äô). Spain, France and Italy have adopted plans in accordance with this Regulation. These plans have proved ineffective in achieving the objectives set by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (""STECF"") has shown that the exploitation of most demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean far exceeds the levels required to reach maximum sustainable yield (MSY): more than 80% assessed stocks are overfished in this sub-region. In addition, the biomass of some of these stocks is close to the limit reference point, indicating that there is a high probability of collapse. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to establish a multiannual plan for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account all the evidence collected and analysed through the impact assessment process, the preferred option is a multi-annual plan at EU level. The reasons for this are as follows: the multi-annual plan would have more positive environmental impacts. In particular, the probability of achieving fishing mortality targets for all stocks would be around 36 %; around 70 % of the assessed stocks would recover to spawning stock biomass (SSB) levels above the precautionary reference point; socio-economic performance is expected to improve across all fleets by 2025; a multi-annual plan would be streamlined (a single regulatory framework), stable (it considers the long-term perspective) and transparent (the three Member States concerned would jointly bring fishing mortalities to sustainable levels). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation aims to address the high levels of overfishing and the ineffective regulatory framework by introducing for the first time a multi-annual plan at EU level. Its aim is to achieve the objectives of the CFP Regulation in western Mediterranean demersal fisheries, namely with regards to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and managed in a way that secure economic, social and employment benefits. The plan will also facilitate implementation of the landing obligation and enable a regionalised approach, whereby the Member States concerned would be involved in the design of management measures. The proposal applies to the stocks driving demersal fisheries (i.e. hake, red mullet, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp, giant red shrimp and Norway lobster), by-catch stocks and other demersal stocks for which sufficient data are not available. It also applies to commercial and recreational fisheries exploiting those stocks in the western Mediterranean. The proposal: lays down quantifiable targets for fishing mortality which should be achieved by 2020 at the latest. The ranges would allow for MSY-based management of the stocks concerned, while providing some flexibility in the context of mixed fisheries; introduces, for each stock, a limit reference point (or biomass limit, BLIM) at which the stock would be in serious danger of collapse and a precautionary reference point (or biomass precautionary, BPA) as a safety margin; introduces safeguard measures to allow a stock to recover in the event of the precautionary or limit reference points being exceeded; introduces a fishing effort regime at EU level for all trawls in the areas and vessels length categories in Annex I; sets a spatio-temporal closure prohibiting trawls from operating within the 100 m isobath from 1 May to 31 July each year. This would reserve the coastal zone for more selective gears in order to protect nursery areas and sensitive habitats, and enhance the social sustainability of small-scale fisheries; introduces regionalisation provisions as required to extend and/or amend exemptions for species with demonstrated high survival rates and de minimis exemptions; establishes regional cooperation among Member States with a view to adopting provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures, including technical measures, for certain stocks; introduces scientific monitoring to assess progress towards maximum sustainable yield for the stocks driving demersal fisheries and, where possible, by-catch stocks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no impact on the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fiscalis 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of Member States of the Union and of taxpayers, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The Union and the national tax authorities still suffer from insufficient capacity and insufficient cooperation ‚Äì both within the EU and with third countries ‚Äì to carry out effectively and efficiently their missions. They need to provide quick and joint responses to emerging problems such as tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, digitalisation and new business models, while at the same time preventing unnecessary administrative burden for citizens and businesses in cross-border transactions. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a new fiscalis programme under the Single Market, Innovation and Digital budget heading. It shall comprise means and a budget which shall support tax policy and tax authorities through administrative and IT capacity building activities and operational cooperation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the Fiscalis 2020 programme. Objective : the programme has the general objective to support tax authorities and taxation to enhance the functioning of the single market, foster Union competitiveness and protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States. It supports tax policy, tax cooperation and administrative capacity building, including human competency and the development and operation of the European electronic systems. The programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The implementation of the programme will occur through the most commonly used spending mechanisms of Union budget, namely public procurement and grants. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation provides mechanisms, means as well as the necessary funding aiming to support tax policy and to improve cooperation between tax authorities. The proposed measure comprises inter alia meetings and similar ad-hoc events, project-based structured collaboration and human competency and capacity building actions, in which Member States and their officials may participate on a voluntary basis. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of common components and national components reflecting better the reality of IT projects and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand, and the Member States on the other hand, have been listed A multi-annual strategic plan for taxation to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure jointly the development and operation, including the design, specification, conformance testing, deployment, maintenance, evolution, security, quality assurance and quality control, of the European electronic systems listed in the multi-annual strategic plan for taxation. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 270 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 set up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The Commission presented in October 2013 a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Regulation. The report concluded that the EU export control system provides solid legal and institutional foundations but the system must be upgraded in order to face new challenges. In April 2014, the Commission adopted a communication setting out concrete policy options for the review of the EU export control regime and its adaptation to rapidly changing technological, economic and political circumstances. In 2015, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of the review options outlined in that communication. As part of the impact assessment, the Commission conducted a public consultation, from which it emerged that‚Äôs stakeholders generally agreed that a review of current rules would improve the export control system, in particular with regards to its capacity to address evolving security risks such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism and to respond to rapid scientific and technological developments. The export control policy review has been identified as an initiative under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT). Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 has been amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and readability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: besides the baseline scenario (no policy change), the impacts of four other scenarios were assessed. A combination of the options ""EU system upgrade"" (adjustments to the regulatory framework), and ""EU system modernisation"" (focusing on cyber-surveillance Technologies and human rights) was retained as the preferred solution. CONTENT: the proposal to recast Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 aims to set up a Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering, technical assistance and transit of dual-use items. The main points are as follows; Control provisions : the proposal: contains amendments to key export control notions: the definition of dual-use items is thus revised to reflect the emergence of new types of dual-use items, such as cyber-surveillance technologies. The proposal also clarifies that controls apply to natural persons, who may be ""exporters"", especially when it comes to technology transfers; clarifies controls on and facilitates intangible technology transfers, as they only become subject to control when the dual-use technology is made available to a person in a third country; clarifies controls applicable to technical assistance involving a cross-border movement; strengthens brokering controls, (i) by extending the definition of the broker to subsidiaries of EU companies outside of the EU, as well as to brokering services supplied by third country nationals from within the EU territory; (ii) by harmonising their application to non-listed items and military end-uses and extending their application to terrorism and human rights violations; harmonises the application of transit controls to non-listed items and military end-uses, and extends controls to the risk of misuse for terrorist acts and human rights violations; puts in place certain controls an anti-circumvention clause to combat trafficking in items of dual usage. EU licensing : the proposal: provides for a definition of authorisations and for common licensing parameters (e.g. validity period) and conditions for use of the EU general authorisations and for global licences; establishes a new authorisation for 'large-projects' for certain large multiannual projects e.g. construction of a nuclear power plant; introduces new general authorisations regarding encryption and low value shipments to facilitate trade while ensuring a sufficient level of security through robust control modalities (e.g. registration, notification and reporting, and auditing); introduces a general authorisation on intra-company transfers of dual-use technology in non-sensitive countries, in particular for research and development purposes, as long as the technology remains under the ownership or control of the parent company. Convergence of catch-all controls : the proposal provides for a clarification and harmonisation of the definition and scope of catch-all controls to ensure their uniform application across the EU. Re-evaluation of intra-EU transfers : the proposal revises the list of items subject to control within the EU in order to focus controls on an updated list of most sensitive items, taking account of technological and commercial developments; Control of exports of cyber-surveillance technologies : the proposal sets out new provisions for an effective control focusing on specific and relevant cyber-surveillance technologies. It introduces an EU autonomous list of specific cyber-surveillance technologies of concern to be subject to controls (monitoring centres and data retention systems), with detailed technical parameters. Enhanced cooperation : the proposal provides for enhanced information exchange between competent authorities and the Commission with a view to support effective and consistent application of controls. It introduces a legal basis regarding the introduction of electronic licensing systems and their interconnection with the Dual-Use Electronic System, and for the setting up of 'technical expert groups' bringing together key industry and government experts into a dialogue on the technical parameters for controls. Transparency and outreach : the proposal sets out transparency measures and expands outreach and information-sharing with operators in order to develop a ""partnership with the private sector"". Dialogue with third countries : the proposal provides a basis for the development of regular dialogues between the EU and key trade partners, and for the negotiation of mutually beneficial measures such as end-user verification programmes (whereby selected third-country companies could be granted special status of ""Verified end-user"" and obtain EU-wide recognition and facilitation of controls). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : some specific provisions in the proposal are expected to have implications on the resources of relevant services at EU or national levels, in particular ; extended competence for the Commission to amend lists of dual-use items and general export authorisations by delegated acts ; cyber-surveillance controls expected to require some additional administrative costs (staff) for administrations, both at national and EU level; the realisation of certain actions ‚Äì such as the development of electronic licensing systems ‚Äì while the financing and budgetary implications remain to be assessed in detail before any decision is taken regarding their implementation. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as set out in its 6 April Communication ""Towards a reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe"", the migratory and refugee crisis exposed significant structural weaknesses and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the European asylum system, and of the Dublin rules in particular. The current Dublin system was not designed to ensure a sustainable sharing of responsibility for applicants across the Union. This has led to situations where a limited number of individual Member States had to deal with the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving in the Union, putting the capacities of their asylum systems under strain and leading to some disregard of EU rules. In addition, the effectiveness of the Dublin system is undermined by a set of complex and disputable rules on the determination of responsibility as well as lengthy procedures. In particular, this is the case for the current rules which provide for a shift of responsibility between Member States after a given time. It is clear that the Dublin system must be reformed, both to simplify it and enhance its effectiveness in practice, and to be equal to the task of dealing with situations when Member States' asylum systems are faced with disproportionate pressure. This proposal on the reform of the Dublin III Regulation is part of a first set of legislative proposals the Commission is presenting in the context of a major reform of the Common European Asylum System. These proposals include: this draft Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person; a draft Regulation which aims to extend the scope of the Eurodac Regulation to include the possibility for Member States to store and search data belonging to third-country nationals or stateless persons who are not applicants for international protection and found irregularly staying in the EU; a draft Regulation on the European Union Agency for Asylum which aims to strengthen the mandate of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). A second stage of legislative proposals reforming the Asylum Procedures and Qualification Directives, as well as the Reception Conditions Directive is due to follow to ensure the full reform of all parts of the EU asylum system. CONTENT: this proposal is a recast of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third country national or a stateless person (""the Dublin III Regulation""). A summary of the main provisions is as follows: New fairness mechanism : a new automated system will allow for the registration of all asylum applications made in the EU and the monitoring on a daily basis of the number of applications made in each Member State. The new system will automatically establish when a country is handling a disproportionate number of asylum applications. This reference number is identified on the basis of a key, taking account of the country's population size, and the size of its economy. Once the fairness mechanism is triggered, all new applications in the Member State concerned are allocated to other Member States, after an admissibility check has been carried out, until the number of applications is back below the 150% level. The fairness mechanism will also factor in the effort being made by a Member State to resettle those in need of international protection direct from a third country. Criteria for the reference key : the reference key is based on two criteria with equal 50% weighting: the size of the population, and the total GDP of a Member State. The number of applications for which a given Member State is responsible and the numbers of persons effectively resettled by a Member State form the basis for the calculation using the reference key and threshold. NB: a Member State will also have the option to temporarily not take part in the allocation. In that case, it would have to make a financial solidarity contribution of EUR 250 000 to the Member State receiving an applicant for whom it would otherwise have been responsible under the fairness mechanism. Streamlined procedures : procedures will be streamlined, in particular through shorter time limits for the different steps of the determination procedure, transfers and access to the asylum procedure: take charge requests, asking another Member State to take over responsibility for an application, have to be sent within one month and a decision taken by the receiving country within one month of receipt of the request. No reply will be tantamount to accepting the request; requests from one Member State to another to take back an applicant for whom the latter is responsible and who has absconded ('take back requests') will be transformed into simple take back notifications. Such notifications have to be submitted within two weeks of registration and do not require a reply, only a confirmation of receipt. All Member States will be under a clear obligation to take back applicants they are responsible for; appeals against transfer decisions will be dealt with within 15 days; proper registration of all asylum applications in the EU should help detect multiple applications and prevent irregular secondary movements. Obligations for applicants : the new system introduces clear legal obligations for applicants: explicit obligation for applicants to apply for asylum in the Member State of first irregular entry or in the Member State where a person has stayed legally prior to the application for asylum. This will make clear that applicants do not have the right to choose in which Member State they submit their application. In case an asylum applicant does not comply with this new obligation, Member States must examine the application in an accelerated procedure; applicants will also be obliged to provide all relevant information for determining the Member State responsible for their claim in a timely manner and failure to comply will have proportionate procedural consequences, such as the preclusion of information submitted unjustifiably late; to discourage secondary movements, applicants will only be entitled to material reception rights in the country where he or she is required to be present, with the exception of emergency healthcare; an obligation for the Member State of application to check whether the applicant comes from a first country of asylum or a safe third country. The Member State making this admissibility check will be considered responsible for these applications. The Member State of application must also check whether the applicant comes from a safe country of origin or presents a security risk, in which case they have to examine the application through an accelerated procedure. Best interests of children and unaccompanied minors : under the new system, the rights of unaccompanied minors will be enhanced and the assessment of the best interests of the child reinforced. The proposal clarifies that the Member State where the minor first lodged his or her application for international protection will be responsible, unless it is demonstrated that this is not in the best interests of the minor. Appeals will be accelerated but will have automatic suspensive effects, meaning no transfers will be carried out while the appeal is ongoing. The rights of unaccompanied minors have been strengthened through better defining the principle of the best interests of the child and by setting out a mechanism for making a best interests of the child-determination in all circumstances implying the transfer of a minor. New safeguards for asylum seekers : reinforced family reunification : the right to family reunification of asylum seekers present on the EU territory will be reinforced and the scope will be extended to also include siblings of an applicant as well as families formed in transit, after leaving the country of origin but before arrival on the territory of the Member State; detention : under the new system, the detention period for the purpose of transfers has been significantly reduced, from six to four weeks. Review clause : the Commission will review the functioning of the fairness mechanism 18 months after entry into force of the Regulation and annually from then on in order to assess whether the objective of ensuring a proportionate sharing of responsibility between Member States and of relieving disproportionate pressure on certain Member States is met. This review will in particular verify that the threshold for triggering the mechanism is effective. Territorial provisions : the United Kingdom and Ireland may participate in this proposal, but are not required to do so, in accordance with the relevant Protocols attached to the Treaties. As regards Denmark, it has an opt out and does not participate in justice and home affairs measures. However, Denmark applies the current Regulation on the basis of an international agreement concluded in 2006. Under that agreement, Denmark may opt in to the recast Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial resources necessary to support the implementation of this proposal amount to EUR 1828.6 million foreseen for the period 2017-2020. This would cover the transfer costs once the corrective allocation mechanism has been triggered for the benefit of a Member State, the establishment and operation of the IT system for the registration and automatic allocation of asylum applicants."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 25 June 2012, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part. Negotiations began in July 2012 and the Agreement was signed on 5 October 2016. Pending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and New Zealand, are provisionally applied. The Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and New Zealand, a partnership which is based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties. Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy, the common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part. Accordingly, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. No additional provisions are required as legal basis CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The purpose of the Agreement is ‚Äòto establish a strengthened partnership between the Parties and to deepen and enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest, reflecting shared values and common principles, including through intensifying high-level dialogue.‚Äô The content of the Agreement covers three pillars: - political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU; - cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as : - sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of: - Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU‚Äôs relations with New Zealand."

The ISF-Borders and Visa will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an 'efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders'. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis. Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors, as the respective Association Agreements do not provide for such rules. The aim of the draft Agreement with Norway is to establish the arrangements of this participation and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: under this proposal, it is proposed that the Council adopt the Decision in which it is called upon to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. Rules for the participation of Norway in the ISF-Borders and Visas: the Agreement provides for a number of technical provisions to establish the framework for participation. The funds allocated to Norway under the ISF-Borders and Visa shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. Protection of the financial interests of the Union against fraud is also stressed. Budgetary control: provisions are laid down as regards budgetary and financial controls. Member States shall be subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. Moreover, the Court of Auditors and OLAF shall be granted suitable access to carry out controls. Financial contributions from Norway to the ISF: provisions are also provided to guarantee the payments of the contribution from Norway to the ISF for the implementation of EU actions and its mid-term review and other specific actions. For the years 2016 to 2018, Norway shall make annual payments to the budget of the ISF-Borders and Visa in the order of EUR 19 777 712. Territorial application: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis. In this regard, the present Agreement with Norway also builds on the Schengen acquis. Denmark shall not take part in the adoption of this decision and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application. The same goes for the United Kingdom and Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may only adopt the act if Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) is the International Commodity Body (ICB) for cotton. Its mission is to assist governments in fostering a healthy world cotton economy. ICAC acts as a statistical observer and brings together producing, consuming, and trading countries and all segments of the cotton industry. It has an overall facilitating role. To date, the ICAC is one of the few ICBs1 where the European Union is not a member, whereas nine Member States have been members of the ICAC in their own right (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain). Membership of ICAC is in the interest of the Union, owing to the significance of cotton to the Union's economy. On various occasions (namely in its conclusions of 2004, 2008 and 2010), the Council of the European Union has requested the European Commission to consider EU membership of ICAC. It authorised the Commission in 2013 to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union and on the basis of negotiating directives, the accession of the Union to ICAC. CONTENT: with this draft decision, the Council is called upon to permit the EU to accede to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, on behalf of the Union. The Union will pay a contribution in line with the ICAC Rules and Regulations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: ICAC membership is based on the payment of an annual contribution. It is calculated on an annual basis as a function of the number of ICAC's members (fixed part) and the volume of raw cotton traded by each member (variable part). A first contribution of maximum EUR 400 000 would be required, which will give the EU an appropriate influence in ICAC affairs and allow broad EU involvement in ICAC's activities."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a common and comparable legal framework for European statistics on migration and international protection. To respond to new needs within the Union for statistics on asylum and managed migration, and the rapidly changing characteristics of migration, the Commission considers that there is a need for a framework allowing quick response to changing needs as regards statistics on asylum and managed migration. The Commission has regularly acknowledged the need to improve the collection of statistics, particularly as regards the figures on the return of third-country nationals staying illegally in the EU, and as regards children. CONTENT: the main purpose of this initiative is to amend Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 so as to provide a legal basis for existing voluntary data collections already conducted by most national authorities, while providing the necessary flexibility to adapt to future data needs. On the basis of information provided by stakeholders and taking into account immediate priorities to address the most serious shortcomings, it is proposed to: increase the frequency of statistics on returns and obligations to leave from annual to quarterly, while introducing additional disaggregations; introduce new disaggregations of asylum statistics by unaccompanied minors; add new disaggregations of resettlement statistics; introduce statistics on first-time asylum applicants and new statistics on Dublin re-examination requests; introduce new disaggregations of statistics on residence permits. In order to ensure a better availability of European statistics on asylum and managed migration and to introduce a flexibility mechanism, the Commission could adopt implementing acts for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions on disaggregations."

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration of 31 October 1958 created a special union within the framework of the Union for the Protection of Industrial Property which was established by the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property signed in Paris on 20 March 1883. The contracting parties undertake to protect on their territories the appellations of origin of products of the other countries within the Special Union which are recognised and protected as such in the country of origin and which are registered at the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), unless those parties declare, within a period of one year from the receipt of the notification of such a registration, that they cannot ensure such protection. Seven Member States are parties to the Lisbon Agreement, namely Bulgaria (since 1975), the Czech Republic (since 1993), France (since 1966), Italy (since 1968), Hungary (since 1967), Portugal (since 1966) and Slovakia (since 1993). Three other Member States have signed, but not ratified the Lisbon Agreement, namely Greece, Spain and Romania. The Union itself is not a party to the Lisbon Agreement as it provides that only countries can accede to it. On 20 May 2015, the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications was adopted which revised the Lisbon Agreement. In order for the Union to be able to properly exercise its exclusive competence for the areas covered by the Geneva Act and its functions in the context of its comprehensive protection systems for agricultural designations of origin and geographical indications, the Union should accede to the Geneva Act and become a contracting party thereto. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the accession of the European Union to the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on designations of origin and geographical indications (Geneva Act). The Geneva Act expands the scope of the Special Union in order to extend the protection of appellations of origin of products to all geographical indications. The revised Agreement:  outlines the terms, conditions and processes by which contracting parties may seek protection for registered appellations of origin and geographical indications, while allowing for appropriate safeguards and transitional periods for certain entities; allows contracting parties, with regard to procedures relating to applications and international registration, to request a declaration of intent to use, if necessary, the protection provided by their national legislation of the Geneva Act and the Common Regulations under the Lisbon Agreement and the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement; increases the registration fees from 500 CHF to 1000 CHF, future flexibility has been introduced to allow Members to further contribute to the budget as required. An individual fee can be required by Contracting Parties in order to covers the cost of substantive examination of the international registration; constitutes the obligation for each Contracting Party to protect registered appellations of origin and geographical indications on its territory, within its own legal system and practice but in accordance with the terms of this Act, subject to any refusal, renunciation, invalidation or cancellation that may become effective with respect to its territory; lays down the content of protection: each contracting party is required to provide the legal means to prevent use of the appellation of origin or geographical indication in respect of goods of the same kind but different origin and in respect of goods not of the same kind or services if such use would indicate or suggest a connection between those goods or services and the beneficiaries, and would be likely to damage their interests, or to impair or dilute or take unfair advantage of, the reputation of the AO/GI; effectively ensures that protected designations may not subsequently become generic; explicitly provides for coexistence of appellations of origin or geographical indications with prior trade mark rights; allows contracting parties to provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark; provides for the option of a phasing out period for prior uses; does not refer to invalidity grounds and hence allows any Contracting Party to invoke its domestic rules, in line with EU legislation, which does not have an enumerative list of invalidation grounds, either. The Geneva Act will enter into force three months after five parties have ratified it."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is related to the Commission proposal for a Council Decision on the Union's accession to the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on appellations of origin and geographical indications. The Geneva Act protects appellations of origin, including ‚Äòdesignations of origin‚Äô as defined by Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and geographical indications, which are henceforth both referred to as ‚Äògeographical indications‚Äô. In order for the Union to be fully able to exercise its exclusive competence in relation to its common commercial policy, it will become a contracting party to the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on appellations of origin and geographical indications (‚Äòthe Geneva Act‚Äô). The contracting parties to the Geneva Act are members of a Special Union created by the Lisbon Agreement for the protection of appellations of origin and their international registration (‚ÄòSpecial Union‚Äô). The Union is to be represented by the Commission in the Special Union. It is necessary to establish a legal framework for the action of the European Union following its accession to the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on designations of origin and geographical indications. The proposal is consistent with the EU's general policy to promote and enhance the protection of geographical indications through bilateral, regional and multilateral agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has not carried out an impact assessment. It stresses, however, there would be a number of advantages in case of EU membership: it would ensure that current and future GIs registered at EU level but not registered by the seven EU Member States in the Lisbon Union could become eligible for protection in the Lisbon system; EU GIs could in principle gain rapid, high level, indefinite protection in all current and future parties to the Geneva Act; it would help rural stakeholders protect at global level what is valuable at local level, thus countervailing the usual globalisation trend toward uniform commodity standards and downward pressure on agricultural product prices; from an administrative point of view, the Geneva Act provides a single set of rules for obtaining protection in all members and therefore a simpler and more efficient mechanism compared to the current EU practice of dealing with a variety of local procedures through bilateral agreements; for businesses, EU accession will entail no additional adjustment, compliance or transaction costs or administrative burdens other than potential individual examination fees which Lisbon Members may apply but which will be diminished by the savings resulting from the international procedure. CONTENT: the proposal establishes rules allowing the Union to fully exercise all its rights and obligations following its accession to the Geneva Act. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: International registration of geographical indications following accession : following the accession of the Union to the Geneva Act, the Commission should as a first step file with the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization ('the International Bureau') an application for registration of a list of geographical indications originating and protected in the territory of the Union in their register (‚Äòthe International Register‚Äô). This list should be established in close consultation with the Member States, following this established practice and methodology which is used for some of the bilateral international agreements on Geographical indications which the EU has concluded (taking into account production value and export value, protection under other agreements as well as current or potential misuse in the third countries concerned, and balance between Member States), taking into account the scope of Geographical indications registered by third country Lisbon members. Subsequent international registration of geographical indications of the Union : following the accession of the Union to the Geneva Act, applications for international registration of additional protected geographical indications registered in the Union would be possible on the initiative of the Commission or at the request of a Member State or producer group concerned. Examination of geographical indications of third countries entered in the International Register : the proposal establishes appropriate procedures should be established in order for the Commission to assess geographical indications originating in the contracting parties to the Geneva Act which are not Member States ('third Contracting Parties') and registered in the International Register, in order to provide for a procedure to decide on protection in the Union and to cancel such protection, where relevant. Enforcement by the Union of the protection of geographical indications originating in third Contracting Parties and registered in the International Register should be done in accordance with Chapter III of the Geneva Act, which requires each Contracting Party to make available effective legal remedies for the protection of registered geographical indications and provide that legal proceedings for ensuring their protection may be brought by a public authority or by any interested party, whether a natural person or a legal entity and whether public or private, depending on its legal system and practice. Transitional protection : seven Member States are members of the Special Union and as such have accepted the protection of the geographical indications of third Contracting parties. In order to provide for them the means to fulfil their international obligations assumed before the accession of the Union to the Geneva Act, a transitional arrangement should be provided which should produce effects at national level only, and have no effect on intra-Union or international trade. Fees : the fees to be paid under the Geneva Act, and specified in the Common Regulations, for the filing an application with the International Bureau for the international registration of a geographical indication and for the supply of extracts, attestations or other information concerning the contents of that registration should be borne by the Member State from which the geographical indication originates."

BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called ‚ÄúOpen Skies‚Äù cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (the ‚Äúhorizontal authorisation‚Äù). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks to approve on behalf of the Union the Agreement between the European Union and the Philippines on certain aspects of air services. The Agreement replaces certain provisions of the existing bilateral air services agreements concluded between the Member States and the Republic of the Philippines: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. - Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: whistleblowers can play a key role in exposing and preventing breaches of the law and in safeguarding the welfare of society. Whistleblower protection currently provided in the European Union is fragmented across Member States and uneven across policy areas. This fragmentation and these gaps mean that, in many situations, whistleblowers are not properly protected against retaliation: 85 % of respondents to the 2017 public consultation carried out by the Commission believe that workers very rarely or rarely report concerns about threat or harm to the public because of fear of legal and financial consequences. Lack of effective whistleblower protection raises further concerns on its negative impacts on the freedom of expression and the freedom of the media, enshrined in Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. It can also impair the enforcement of EU law. For these reasons, the importance of providing effective whistleblower protection for safeguarding the public interest is increasingly acknowledged both at European1 and international level. The European Parliament, in its resolution of 24 October 2017 called on the Commission to present a horizontal legislative proposal to guarantee a high level of protection for whistleblowers in the EU, in both the public and private sectors, as well as in national and EU institutions. The proposal draws upon the case law of the European Court of Human Rights on the right to freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights 10 ECHR, and the principles developed on this basis by the Council of Europe in its 2014 Recommendation on Protection of Whistleblowers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is (i) a Directive introducing whistleblower protection in specific areas (including the financial interests of the Union) where it is necessary to address whistleblowers' underreporting in order to enhance the enforcement of Union law, as breaches would lead to serious harm to the public interest; (ii) complemented by a Communication establishing a policy framework at EU level, including measures in support of national authorities. In other areas of the single market, such as in public procurement, the benefits are estimated to be in the range of EUR 5.8 to EUR 9.6 billion each year for the EU as a whole. CONTENU: the proposal establishes a set of common minimum standards for the protection of persons reporting on the following unlawful activities or abuse of law: (i) public procurement, (ii) financial services, (iii) money laundering and terrorist financing, (iv) product safety, (v) transport safety, (vi) environmental protection, (vii) nuclear safety, (viii) food and feed safety, (ix) animal health and welfare, (x) public health, (xi) consumer protection, (xii) privacy, data protection and security of networks and information systems. It also applies to breaches of EU competition rules, breaches and abuses of company taxation rules and damage to EU financial interests. Internal and external alerts : the proposal requires Member States to ensure that legal entities in the private and public sectors put in place adequate internal reporting channels and procedures for follow-up of reports. This shall include private legal entities with more than 50 employees or an annual turnover of more than EUR 10 million as well as all national or regional administrations and municipalities in cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants. The proposal requires that reporting channels ensure the confidentiality of the reporting person‚Äôs identity and that the service responsible for receiving the report follows up diligently and informs the informant within a reasonable timeframe not exceeding three months after the report. Member States shall also be required to ensure that competent authorities have in place external reporting channels and procedures for receiving and following-up on reports and sets out the minimum standards applicable to such channels and procedures. Protection of informants : in order to discourage malicious or abusive reports, the proposal requires that reporting persons have reasonable grounds to believe that the information reported was true at the time of reporting. Moreover, reporting persons are generally required to use internal channels first; if these channels do not work or could not reasonably be expected to work, they may report to the competent authorities, and, as a last resort, to the public/ the media. The proposal requires that retaliation in any form be prohibited and sets out further measures that Member States should take to ensure the protection of reporting persons, including: making easily accessible to the public and free of charge independent information and advice on procedures and remedies available on protection against retaliation; exempting reporting persons from liability for breach of restrictions on disclosure of information imposed by contract or by law; providing for the reversal of the burden of proof in legal proceedings so that, in prima facie cases of retaliation, it is up to the person taking action against a whistleblower to prove that it is not retaliating against the act of whistleblowing; putting at the disposal of reporting persons remedial measures against retaliation. Persons involved in acts reported by a whistleblower should enjoy the presumption of innocence, the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial and the right of defence. Lastly, the proposal provides for effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties which are necessary: (i) to punish and proactively discourage actions aimed at hindering reporting, retaliatory actions, vexatious proceedings against reporting persons and breaches of the duty of maintaining the confidentiality of their identity, and, (ii) to discourage malicious and abusive whistleblowing."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal should be seen in the broader context of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) action plan and the CMU Mid-Term Review, to establish a genuine internal capital market by addressing fragmentation in the capital markets, removing regulatory barriers to the financing of the economy and increasing the supply of capital to businesses. Investment funds are investment products created with the sole purpose of pooling investors‚Äô capital, and investing that capital collectively through a portfolio of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds and other securities. In the EU, investment funds can be categorised as undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and alternative investment funds (AIFs) managed by alternative investment fund managers (AIFMs). While EU investment funds have seen rapid growth, with a total of EUR 14 310 billion in assets under management in June 2017, the EU investment fund market is still predominantly organised as a national market: 70 % of all assets under management are held by investment funds authorised or registered for distribution only in their domestic market; only 37 % of UCITS and about 3 % of AIFs are registered for distribution in more than three Member States. Regulatory barriers , namely Member States‚Äô marketing requirements, regulatory fees and administrative and notification requirements represent a significant disincentive to the cross-border distribution of funds. These barriers were identified in response to the Green Paper on Capital Markets Union. These new measures are expected to reduce the cost of going cross-border and should support a more integrated single market for investment funds. They should, in turn, should reduce market fragmentation, increase competition, and ultimately help to deliver greater choice and better value for investors in the EU. This proposal is presented together with a proposed dedicated Regulation on facilitating cross-border distribution of collective investment funds and amending Regulations (EU) No 345/2013 and (EU) No 346/2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: following the evaluation of the strategic options being considered, the policy choices are as follows: more transparent national marketing requirements at both national and EU level, harmonisation of the definition of pre-marketing in Directive 2011/61/EU and clearer guidance on the process of checking marketing material; greater transparency of regulatory fees at EU level, and the establishment of key principles to ensure greater consistency in the way these fees are determined; the choice of facilities to support local investors should be left to investment fund managers, with safeguards for investors; increased harmonisation of procedures and conditions for updating or withdrawing notifications on the use of the marketing passport. CONTENT: this proposal amends certain provisions of Directive 2009/65/EC and Directive 2011/61/EU to remove the current regulatory barriers to the cross-border distribution of investment funds in order to make their cross-border distribution simpler, faster and cheaper. Its main elements are: Support for local investors (facilities) : the proposal sets out rules to modernise and specify the requirements for providing facilities to retail investors, a physical presence should not be required by Member States. While requiring that facilities are established in each Member State where marketing activities are carried out and which serve situations such as making subscriptions, making payments or repurchasing or redeeming units, this proposal allows fund managers to use electronic or other means of distance communication with investors. The information and means of communication should be available to investors in the official languages of the Member State where the investor is located. The requirements relating to facilities are also applied to AIFMs where Member States allow them to market units or shares of AIFs to retail investors in their territories. De-notification of the use of the marketing passport : the proposed Directive harmonises the conditions under which investment funds may exit a national market. It creates the possibility for asset managers to stop marketing an investment fund in defined cases in one or several host Member States. Asset managers are allowed to de-notify the marketing of their UCITS only if a maximum of 10 investors who hold up to 1 % of assets under management of this UCITS have invested in this UCITS in an identified Member State. The competent authorities of the home Member State of this UCITS will verify the compliance with this requirement, including the transparency and publication requirement for investors and the repurchase offer. All obligations to inform will continue to apply to remaining investors after de-notification of the marketing activities in a Member State. Pre-marketing : the proposal also allows European asset managers to engage in pre-market activities to test an investment idea or an investment strategy with professional investors. Therefore, this proposal lays down clear conditions, including thresholds, under which deregistration could take place. The thresholds are indicative of when a fund manager may consider that its activities have become insignificant in a particular host Member State."

CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation aims to remove the regulatory barriers that currently hinder the cross-border distribution of investment funds in order to make their cross-border distribution simpler, faster and less costly. The proposed Regulation seeks to: harmonise the procedure and requirements on marketing communications by the national competent authorities. The marketing communications must fulfil, namely (i) the communications are identifiable as such, (ii) present the risks and rewards of purchasing units or shares of AIFs and UCITS in an equally prominent manner and (iii) all information included in marketing communications is fair, clear and not misleading; improve transparency by harmonising national marketing requirements and regulatory fees : the competent authorities will publish online all applicable national laws, regulations and administrative provisions governing marketing rules for AIFs and UCITS, and their summaries, in at least a language customary in the sphere of international finance, requesting the publication in that language next to the official languages or one of the official languages used in a given Member State. Competent authorities have to publish and maintain on their websites central databases on the fees or charges or relevant calculation methodologies; introduces the concept of pre-marketing in Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 on European venture capital funds and Regulation (EU) No 346/2013 on European social entrepreneurship funds. The change would allow managers registered in accordance with those Regulations to target investors by testing their appetite for upcoming investment opportunities or strategies through pre-marketing; introduces a requirement on the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) to better monitor investment funds and to publish and maintain on its website a central database on all AIFMs, UCITS management companies, AIFs and UCITS. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal will have two budgetary implications for ESMA. ESMA will have to prepare regulatory and implementing technical standards, and develop and maintain databases that the public can use for free. The impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 0.441 million for the year of the start of the implementation of the proposal. The financial impact on the EU budget after 2020 will depend on Commission proposals for the next multiannual financial framework."

The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament‚Äôs position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows. The proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) provides for a binding leverage ratio, designed to prevent institutions from excessive leverage, and a binding net stable funding ratio. It strengthens risk-sensitive capital requirements in particular in the area of market risk, counterparty credit risk, and for exposures to central counterparties (CCPs). In addition, it requires for Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) to hold minimum levels of capital and other instruments which bear losses in resolution. This requirement, known as 'Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity' or TLAC), will be integrated into the existing MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities) system, which is applicable to all banks. The amendments focus on: the introduction of a definition of small and non-complex institutions for targeted simplifications of requirements with respect to the application of the principle of proportionality and the need to consider the size and risk profile of a small and non-complex institution in relation to the overall size of the national economy in which that institution primarily operates; the possibility for existing supervisory authorities be able to use their discretion to bring the threshold in line with domestic circumstances. Additional qualitative criteria shall ensure that an institution is only considered to be a small and non-complex institution and able to benefit from the relevant rules for increased proportionality where it fulfils all the relevant criteria; the opportunity for small and non-complex institutions to use a simplified version of the net stable funding ratio (NSFR). A simplified, less granular version of the NSFR should involve collecting a limited number of data points, which on the one hand, reduces the complexity of the calculation for small and non-complex institutions in accordance with proportionality; the needs to introduce a leverage ratio surcharge, since G-SIIs in financial distress permanently weaken the entire financial system and this could cause a new credit crunch in the Union. Because of that danger to the financial system and to the financing of the real economy, an implicit guarantee for G-SIIs emerges based on the expectation that the state will rescue them. The leverage ratio for G-SIIs should therefore be raised by 50% of a G-SII‚Äôs higher-loss absorbency risk-weighted requirements, in addition to the minimum threshold of 3%; the importance, when transposing the TLAC standard into Union law, of ensuring that the institutions fulfil the requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities as quickly as possible in order to ensure smooth loss absorption and recapitalisation in resolution; the need for a suitable phase-in period should, on the one hand, ensure that the implementation of the FRTB Standards does not lead to an abrupt rise in the total own funds requirement for market risks, whilst also ensuring that the phase-in period cannot lead to insufficient own funds requirements for market risks as compared to the status quo; the application by financial institutions of gender neutral remuneration policies, as well as the clarification of remuneration disclosures. Lastly, an amendment stresses that sovereign bonds play a crucial role in providing high-quality liquid assets for investors and stable funding sources for governments. However, in some Member States financial institutions have overly invested in bonds issued by their own governments. Banks should continue their effort towards more diversified sovereign bond portfolios."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in response to the financial crisis that unfolded in 2007-2008, the EU implemented a substantial reform of the financial services regulatory framework to enhance the resilience of institutions (i.e. credit institutions and investment firms) operating in the EU financial sector, largely based on global standards agreed with the EU‚Äôs international partners. However, the adoption of the Basel III framework at international level did not mark the end of the post-crisis reform. Work continued on several elements that were left outstanding at the time. While the reforms have rendered the financial system more stable and resilient against many types of possible future shocks and crises, they do not yet comprehensively address all identified problems. The Commission recognised the need for further risk reduction in its Communication of 24 November 2015 entitled ""Towards the completion of the Banking Union"" and committed to bring forward a legislative proposal that builds on the international agreements. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Regulatory Scrutiny Board issued a positive opinion in September 2016 on a resubmitted impact assessment, following a negative opinion. The modelling has shown that public resources required to support the banking system in case of a financial crisis of the size similar to 2007 ‚Äì 2008 would decrease by 32% ‚Äì a decline from EUR 51 billion to EUR 34 billion. CONTENT: the proposal amending Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) aims to complete the reform agenda by tackling remaining weaknesses and implementing some outstanding elements of the reform that are essential to ensure the institutions' resilience but have only recently been finalised by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (FSB). more risk-sensitive capital requirements, in particular in the area of market risk, counterparty credit risk, and for exposures to central counterparties (CCPs); implementing methodologies that are able to reflect more accurately the actual risks to which banks are exposed; a binding Leverage Ratio to prevent institutions from excessive leverage; a binding Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to address the excessive reliance on short-term wholesale funding and to reduce long-term funding risk. a requirement for Global Systemically Important Institutions (G-SIIs) to hold minimum levels of capital and other instruments which bear losses in resolution. This requirement, known as 'Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity' or TLAC), will be integrated into the existing MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities) system, which is applicable to all banks, and will strengthen the EU's ability to resolve failing G-SIIs while protecting financial stability and minimising risks for taxpayers. It is expected that the proposed amendments will start entering into force in 2019 at the earliest. These proposed amendment to Directive 2013/36/EU (the Capital Requirements Directive or CRD) is part of a legislative package that includes also amendments to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation), to Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive), and to Regulation (EU) No 806/2014 (the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the G-20 endorsed the Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) Term Sheet published by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) in 2015. The TLAC standard requires global systemically important institutions ('G-SIIs') in the Union framework, to hold a sufficient minimum amount of highly loss absorbing (bailin-able) liabilities to ensure smooth and fast absorption of losses and recapitalisation in resolution. In its Communication of 24 November 2015, the Commission committed itself to bringing forward a legislative proposal by the end of 2016 that would enable the TLAC standard to be implemented by the internationally agreed deadline of 2019. The implementation of the TLAC standard in the Union needs to take account of the existing institution-specific minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities ('MREL') applicable to all Union credit institutions and investment firms as laid down in Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Union and of the Council. As TLAC and MREL pursue the same objective of ensuring that Union institutions have sufficient loss absorbing and recapitalisation capacity, the two requirements should be complementary elements of a common framework. In addition, the absence of harmonised rules in the Member States participating in the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) in respect of the implementation of the TLAC standard would create additional costs and legal uncertainty for institutions and make the application of the bail-in tool for cross-border institutions more difficult. The absence of harmonised Union rules also results in competitive distortions on the internal market given that the costs for institutions to comply with the existing requirements and the TLAC standard may differ considerably across the participating Member States. It is therefore necessary to remove those obstacles to the functioning of the internal market and to avoid distortions of competition resulting from the absence of harmonised rules in respect of the implementation of the TLAC standard. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of several policy alternatives. Under the preferred option, the TLAC standard for G-SIIs would be integrated in the existing resolution framework, while that framework would be amended as appropriate to ensure full compatibility with the TLAC standard. CONTENT: according to this proposal, the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation will be amended so that the TLAC will be integrated into the existing MREL (Minimum Requirement for own funds and Eligible Liabilities) system, which is applicable to all banks, and will strengthen the EU's ability to resolve failing G-SIIs while protecting financial stability and minimising risks for taxpayers.

The proposed amendments are part of a legislative package that includes also amendments to Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (the Capital Requirements Regulation), to Directive 2013/36/EU (the Capital Requirements Directive) and to Directive 2014/59/EU (the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive)."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/59/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and Regulation (EU) 806/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation (SRMR) adopted in 2014 laid down the rules on the recovery and resolution of failing institutions and establish the Single Resolution Mechanism, respectively.

Although TLAC and MREL pursue the same regulatory objective, there are, nevertheless, some differences between them in the way they are constructed. The scope of application of MREL covers not only G-SIIs, but the entire Union banking industry.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: BACKGROUND: sovereign bond-backed securities (‚ÄòSBBSs‚Äô) can address some vulnerabilities that have been exposed by or have resulted from the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Reducing risks to financial stability by facilitating the diversification of banks' sovereign portfolios and further weakening the bank-sovereign nexus is of high importance for the completion of the Banking Union. This legislative proposal is part of the Commission's efforts to enhance Banking Union and Capital Markets Union. It aims to enable the emergence of an efficient market for SBBSs over time. In turn, SBBSs could support further portfolio diversification in the financial sector, while creating a new source of high-quality collateral particularly suited for use in cross-border financial transactions. In mid-2016, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) established a high-level task force (henceforth, the ESRB task force) to assess SBBSs' merits and feasibility. The ESRB task force concluded that a market for SBBSs can develop under certain conditions. Yet, whether or not SBBSs are viable can ultimately only be ascertained by putting them to a market test. This proposal paves the way for such a market test. A key finding of the ESRB task force, corroborated also by interactions with market participants and other stakeholders, is that the current regulatory framework constitutes a significant hindrance to the development of SBBSs. Under the existing regulatory framework, SBBSs would be defined as securitisation products, and hence would be treated significantly less favourably than their underlying portfolio of euro area sovereign bonds. However, due to the nature of their underlying assets and their standardised and simple nature, SBBSs carry risks that are comparable to the underlying sovereign bonds rather than regular securitisations. The Commission will also adopt the necessary changes to the prospectus schedules and building blocks to ensure that appropriate disclosure for this new type of financial instrument, tailored to the characteristics of the product, are set out. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: because the proposed framework only enables the private-sector led development of an SBBSs market, but does not guarantee it, the impact assessment considered two distinct scenarios to evaluate impacts, one in which SBBSs reach only a limited volume (EUR 100 billion) and a steady-state one in which they reach EUR 1.5 trillion. As regards the impact of SBBSs on the diversification of banks' sovereign portfolios, the assessment showed that the impact would be small in the limited volume scenario, but significant under the steady state scenario. CONTENT: this proposal aims to provide an enabling framework for a market-led development of Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities. SBBS operation : SBBSs would be created by the private sector specifically set up for the sole purpose of issuing to investors a series of securities representing claims on the proceeds from this underlying portfolio. The various securities issued would bear any losses from the underlying portfolio in a certain sequence (i.e., losses would accrue first to holders of sub-senior, or subordinated, securities and only after such securities have been completely wiped out would they also accrue to the holders of senior claims). SBBSs would not rely on any risk sharing or fiscal mutualisation between Member States. Only private investors would share risks and possible losses. SBBSs are therefore very different from Eurobonds. Composition and structure of a SBBS issue : the proposal provides a set of rules that define the constitutive elements of SBBSs. These rules are necessary to ensure that as standardised a product as possible is produced by the markets. This in turn favours its liquidity and appeal to investors. Under the proposal, the underlying portfolio of SBBSs should be composed of sovereign bonds of all EU Member States whose currency is the euro. A SBBSs issue should be composed of a senior tranche, corresponding to 70 percent of the nominal value of SBBSs issue, and one or more subordinated tranches. The purpose of the subordinated tranches is to provide protection to the senior tranche, which therefore is a low risk instrument. Notification and transparency : the proposal provides rules that define notification and transparency requirements for the issuing entity to ensure that self-attestation is performed in a harmonised and credible way. To ensure that investors are protected from the risk of insolvency of the institution that acquires the sovereign bonds (original purchaser, typically a bank), the issuance of SBBSs should be undertaken by a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) that is exclusively devoted to the issuance and management of SBBSs. The SPEs are responsible for compliance with the product and notification requirements. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is entrusted with the publication of notifications on its website. This will ensure that the SPEs take responsibility for claiming that a product qualifies as an SBBS and that there is transparency in the market. SPEs shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from incorrect or misleading notifications under the conditions stipulated by national law. Monitoring : the proposal contains rules regarding the supervision of SBBSs and possible sanctions in case of non-compliance and/or fraudulent behaviour of the issuing entity. It requires Member States to designate competent authorities in accordance with existing EU financial services legislation. The sanctions inflicted to a special purpose entity should be published. In addition, an SBBS which is found not fulfilling the requirements of the proposed Regulation should be removed without undue delay from the list of SBBS established by ESMA. Lastly, the proposal contains a set of amendments to the existing legal framework required to grant SBBSs regulatory treatment in line with their unique design and properties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as a reminder, the three ESAs established following the financial crisis are the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). They contribute to developing a unified set of rules for EU financial markets (the Single Rulebook). They also help to foster supervisory convergence among competent authorities and to enhance consumer and investor protection. EU action is needed to address identified problems in the area of powers available to the ESAs, their governance framework and their funding framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the scope of the impact assessment covered the areas of: (i) powers; (ii) governance; and (iii) funding of the ESAs, to meet the identified shortcomings and new challenges, such as regulatory and supervisory convergence. Following this analysis, the preferred option as regards governance includes independent members with voting powers alongside the national competent authorities in the decision-making process; introduces a new appointment process and role for the Chairperson and replaces the Management Board by an independent Executive Board composed of full time members that are externally appointed. the preferred option as regards powers clarifies some powers, such as giving a formal role to the ESAs in the ongoing monitoring of the equivalence process, improving the ability for the ESAs to ensure the correct application of Union law, and transfers supervisory powers to the ESAs in targeted areas with predominantly third country or cross-border relevance; the preferred option as regards funding keeps the current annual EU contribution to ESAs' budget, but replaces the residual funding with private sector funding. The preferred options identified were those that best ensured that the ESAs would be able to cope with the growing workload and anticipate the changes to the supervisory framework coming from sectoral legislation. In addition, the preferred options were mostly focusing on targeted changes to the current regime, rather than a complete overhaul. This was in line with the conclusion in the evaluation that the ESAs' framework has been working relatively well in relation to the significant challenges that they had to face and the available means to meet their mandates. CONTENT: the objective of the present proposal is to adjust and upgrade the ESAs framework to ensure they can assume an enhanced responsibility for financial market supervision. The ESAs must be adequately equipped in terms of powers, governance and funding. The proposal addresses these issues as follows: 1) Powers : while harmonised regulation through the Single Rulebook is important for the Single Market, it is not sufficient. Having a coherent approach to the interpretation and application of EU legislation is equally important in order to improve the functioning of the single market and reduce risks of supervisory arbitrage and competition. For this purpose, the ESAs need to be equipped to promote the proper application of EU law and effective common supervisory standards across the EU via supervisory convergence measures and direct supervision in certain areas. This is particularly the case for ESMA within the context of the CMU. This proposal seeks to grant new powers to enhance market integration (for ESMA) and strengthen or clarify existing powers set out in the ESA Regulations. Similarly, the ESAs should be more involved in the authorisation and supervision of entities from non-EU countries that are active in the Union. 2) Governance : this proposal envisages a more effective governance structure for the ESAs by introducing an independent Executive Board with full-time members, replacing the current Management Board and to adjust the composition of the Board of Supervisor. This proposal clarifies the respective competences of these two boards. In addition, the standing and powers of the Chairperson will be enhanced. The newly proposed Executive Board‚Äôs main function will be to prepare decisions to be taken by the Board of Supervisors. This should ensure that the decision making within the Board of Supervisors is quicker and more streamlined. The Executive Board will consist of the Chairperson and a number of full-time members. The number will differ between ESMA on the one hand and EBA and EIOPA on the other hand as the proposal is entrusting ESMA with a significant number of additional tasks in different areas compared to the other two ESAs. The Executive Board will retain the role of the Management Board in relation to the preparation of the ESAs work programmes and budget . It shall be attributed decision making powers in a number of areas. For example, dispute settlements, breach of Union law matters and independent reviews. The amendments also replace the reference to the Management Board with the Executive Board. 3) New funding system : the proposal revises the current funding system. Currently there is a fixed distribution of funding between national authorities (60%) and the EU budget (40%). This rigid funding structure has been deemed insufficient and has often meant in practice that the ESAs have not been able to find the resources needed to cope with increased workloads and have had to abstain from doing certain other tasks. This proposal shall change the funding structure of the ESAs. It is proposed that the ESAs budget shall now rely on three different sources of financing: annual contributions paid by financial institutions that are indirectly supervised by the ESAs. The proposal also provides for a delegated act that will establish how the total amount of annual contributions are shared among the different categories of financial institutions, based on the activity required by each category of them. It shall also establish de minimis thresholds under which small financial institutions do not pay financial contributions or it will set minimum contributions; supervisory fees paid by entities that are directly supervised by the ESAs; a balancing contribution from the EU that would not exceed 40% of the overall revenues of each agency. The amount of this balancing contribution will be set in advance in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). During the transitional period (i.e., until the adoption of the delegated act determining some parameters of the annual contributions), the current funding structure relying on contributions from the EU (40%) and from the national competent authorities (60%) shall be maintained. This shall have an impact on the EU budget as well as on the budget of the various national competent authorities. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed changes to the governance structure, the indirect supervisory powers, the funding system and the direct supervisory powers of the ESAs shall require new resources. EBA, EIOPA and ESMA will respectively require 29, 35 and 156 additional full-time employees when the different provisions of the proposal will enter into application. The ESAs will also incur additional IT costs (estimated at EUR 10.2 million for the period 2019-2020) and translation costs (estimated at EUR 1.8 million for the period 2019-2020). The total appropriations for the period 2019-2012 is estimated at EUR 64.166 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the financial crisis, the EU set up the European System of Financial Supervision (ESFS), built on a two-pillar system of macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision. The European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), established in December 2010, is the macroprudential pillar of the ESFS. Its task is, in particular, to contribute to the prevention or mitigation of systemic risks to financial stability in the EU that arise within the financial system, while taking into account macroeconomic developments, so as to avoid periods of widespread financial distress. It has specific tools, such as recommendations and warnings to shape macroprudential policy in the EU. Consisting of a wide range of members, including national central banks, supervisory authorities and European institutions, the ESRB‚Äôs importance is borne out by its work as a coordination platform and information hub, on monitoring risk from an EU-wide perspective. The 2017 Commission report on the mission and organisation of the ESRB concludes that, while the ESRB is generally well-functioning, improvements on certain specific points are necessary in light of the recent developments in the financial supervisory architecture of the Union and in particular the set-up of a Banking Union. Improvements to the ESRB‚Äôs composition and how it cooperates with European institutions are needed. This proposal shall be seen in the context of the ongoing review of the European Supervisory Agencies (ESAs). CONTENT: the Commission proposes targeted changes to Regulation (EU) No 1092/2010 in order: to propose that the European Central Bank President (ECB) serve as ESRB Chair on a permanent basis; to give a greater role to the head of the Secretariat of the ESRB, whose tasks are currently limited, to enhance the impact of the ESRB warnings and recommendations. The proposal here is to introduce a consultation procedure in which the General Board assesses the candidates proposed by the ECB for the post of Head of the ESRB Secretariat, in particular their qualities and experience necessary to manage the Secretariat. Parliament and Council would be informed of the procedure; to update the ESRB Regulation to take account of the creation of the Banking Union and to add the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Board as voting members of the ESRB General Board; to include the ECB as a possible addressee of ESRB warnings and recommendations for ECB tasks conferred to it by the Single Supervisory Mechanism Regulation (Regulation (EC) No 1024/2013), i.e. for supervisory tasks not pertaining to the conduct of monetary policy; to provide that the advisory technical committee and the advisory scientific committee shall consult, as appropriate, stakeholders at an early stage and in an open and transparent manner to ensure the quality and relevance of ESRB opinions, recommendations and decisions. The Regulation will be reviewed after 5 years. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary cost for the ESRB Secretariat is borne by the ECB and has no direct implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal forms part of a package of measures with the purpose of enhancing the supervision of EU financial markets by improving the operation of the system of European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) and accelerating and completing the Capital Markets Union. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014/65/EU (MiFID II) introduces a new type of services that are subject to authorisation and supervision: Data Reporting Services (DRSs) operated by Data Reporting Services Providers (DRSPs). The effective circulation, monitoring and reconstruction of trading data was not addressed in Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments (MiFID I). This led to EU trading data that was neither consistent nor of adequate quality to monitor whether the objectives of MiFID were being properly achieved. Since inconsistencies in quality, formatting and reliability have a detrimental effect on data transparency, investor protection and market efficiency, MIFID II intends to improve the quality and accessibility of trading data by setting a standard format for trading data that is easy to consolidate, readily understood and available at a reasonable cost, and by imposing formal organisational requirements on data reporting services providers (DRSPs) and requiring them to be authorised by their national authority. Given the cross-border dimension of data handling, the benefits of pooling data-related competences and the adverse impact of potential divergences in supervisory practices on both the quality of trading data and on the tasks of data reporting service providers, it is appropriate to transfer the authorisation of, and the supervision on, data reporting service providers from national authorities to ESMA. In addition, this proposal also concerns the role of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) in the approval processes for internal models that some large insurance companies use to calculate requirements on solvency capital. The Solvency II Directive (Directive 2009/138/EC) provides that in accordance with the risk oriented approach to the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR), it is possible for insurance and reinsurance undertakings and groups, at the level of either individual undertakings or groups, to use internal models for the SCR calculation, rather than the standard formula. These internal models are subject to supervisory approval. Despite the valuable work carried out by EIOPA on supervisory convergence as regards internal models, major inconsistencies remain with regard to the requirements of competent authorities for internal models, and difficulties exist in reaching joint agreements on group internal models within colleges of supervisors. Divergence in the supervision and approval of internal models leads to inconsistencies and creates an uneven level playing field amongst market participants. With a view to strengthening supervisory convergence, the Commission proposes to define in detail the role of EIOPA in the internal risk models adopted by insurance companies. CONTENT: the main provisions of the proposal amending Directive 2016/65/EU and Directive 2009/138/EC seek to: set out amendments that are required for the transfer of current powers and competences vested in the competent authorities to ESMA, which will be responsible for the authorisation and supervision of firms that intend to carry out data reporting services; include the amendments to the Solvency II-Directive to give EIOPA a greater role to contribute to supervisory convergence in the area of internal model application, and comprises changes with respect to information sharing regarding such model applications, the possibility for EIOPA to issue Opinions in relation to that matter, as well as for EIOPA to assist in the settlement of disputes between supervisory authorities, either at their request, on its own initiative or, in certain circumstances, at the request of concerned undertakings; provide that EIOPA should prepare annual reports on this matter. This will allow close monitoring of the situation regarding internal model applications, including bringing to light any outstanding concerns with regard to supervisory convergence in this area. In addition, the proposal applies the necessary amendments to the Solvency II on binding mediation, removing references to a previous dispute settlement procedure with CEIOPS (the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors), which has been superseded by EIOPA."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: investment firms play an important role in facilitating savings and investment flows across the EU. They offer investors (retail, professional, corporate) various services that give them access to the securities and derivatives markets (investment advice, portfolio management, brokerage, execution of orders, etc.). Unlike credit institutions, investment firms do not take deposits or make loans. This means that they are a lot less exposed to credit risk and the risk of depositors withdrawing their money at short notice. There were 6 051 investment firms in the European Economic Area (EEA) at the end of 2015. Most EEA investment firms are small or medium-sized enterprises. At present, these companies are concentrated in the United Kingdom, but considering relocating part of their operations in the EU-27, particularly to the Member States participating in the banking union. The UK decision to leave the EU highlights the need to modernise the EU's regulatory architecture. As one of the new priority actions to strengthen capital markets, the Commission announced in its mid-term review of the Capital Markets Union action plan, that it would propose a more effective prudential and supervisory framework, calibrated to the size and nature of investment firms. This proposal for a directive and the accompanying proposal for a regulation aim to ensure that investment firms that are not systemically important (the majority of them) are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and other key prudential requirements and supervisory measures that are tailored to their activities, but sufficiently stringent not to jeopardize the stability of the EU's financial markets. The proposals are the outcome of a review mandated by Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (Capital Requirements Regulation, or CRR) which, together with Directive 2013/36/EU (Capital Requirements Directive IV, or CRD IV), constitutes the current prudential framework for investment firms. The prudential framework applicable to investment firms set out in CRR / CRD IV works in conjunction with the MiFID II Directive / MiFIR Regulation on markets for financial instruments. Systemically important investment firms, some of which qualify as globally important companies, would remain subject to the existing framework set out in CRR / CRD IV. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the review of the prudential framework for investment firms was carried out in consultation with the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the competent national authorities represented in these European Supervisory Authorities. A working document accompanying the proposal concludes that, overall, the EBA recommendations represent a step towards a prudential framework for investment firms, which ensures that they operate on a sound financial basis, without hindering their commercial prospects. CONTENT: the proposal for a directive revises and simplifies existing EU rules governing the prudential treatment of investment firms in order to (i) better accommodate and address risks in their business models; (ii) improve the level playing field among firms; and (iii) enhance supervisory convergence. It applies to all investment firms covered by MIFID II, whose application is scheduled to begin in January 2018. In specific, the proposal: requires Member States to designate an authority to exercise the prudential supervisory powers provided for in this directive, transferring the relevant provisions of CRD IV to the proposed directive; revises and harmonises throughout the EU the initial capital levels, based on the services and activities that investment firms are authorised to provide in accordance with MIFID, from the levels stipulated in CRD IV to take into account inflation since these levels were set. Transitional arrangements are made to allow smaller firms in particular to attain the new amounts of initial capital where necessary; confers the powers set out in CRD IV on the authorities of home and host countries for the prudential supervision of investment firms and establishes the arrangements for cooperation between these authorities; introduces provisions for the exchange of information between the competent authorities on prudential supervision and professional secrecy on the basis of CRD IV; requires Member States to establish administrative penalties and other administrative measures that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive in order to deal with infringements of the provisions of the directive; introduces simplified requirements for investment firms and competent authorities to assess the adequacy of arrangements and procedures to ensure that firms comply with the provisions of the Directive; gives competent authorities the power to review and evaluate the prudential status of investment firms and to request, where appropriate, changes in areas such as governance and internal controls, risk management processes and procedures and, where necessary, set additional requirements, including capital and liquidity requirements; revise the rules on corporate governance and remuneration to prevent excessive risk taking by the staff of investment firms; however, small, non-interconnected investment firms would be exempt from these rules. The proposal requires investment firms to establish appropriate ratios between variable and fixed components of remuneration. In addition, it sets a threshold at firm and staff levels below which investment firms and/or staff members will benefit from the derogations from the application of the rules on the deferral and pay-out in instruments; provides for the possibility for the Union to conclude agreements with third countries regarding the means of supervising compliance with the group capital test. Administrative cooperation arrangements with third countries supervisory authorities may be concluded by the Member States and EBA to facilitate the exchange of information. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

Systemically important investment firms, some of which qualify as globally important companies, would remain subject to the existing framework set out in CRR / CRD IV. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the review of the prudential framework for investment firms was carried out in consultation with the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the competent national authorities represented in these European Supervisory Authorities. A working document accompanying the proposal concludes that, overall, the EBA recommendations represent a step towards a prudential framework for investment firms, which ensures that they operate on a sound financial basis, without hindering their commercial prospects. CONTENT : the proposal for a regulation lays down requirements in terms of own funds, levels of minimum capital, concentration risk, liquidity, reporting and public disclosure for all investment firms that are not systemic. Level of application : the prudential regime for investment firms that are not considered to be systemically important should apply on an individual basis to each investment firm. A derogation is provided for small and non-interconnected firms within banking groups subject to consolidated application and supervision under the CRR/CRD IV. Own funds: the capital instruments which qualify as own funds for investment firms to meet their capital requirements under this Regulation consist of the same items as under CRR/CRD IV. For this purpose, Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital should constitute at least 56 % of regulatory capital, with Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital eligible for up to 44 % and Tier 2 capital eligible for up to 25 % of regulatory capital. Capital requirements : all investment firms must maintain an amount equal to the initial capital required for their authorisation as permanent minimum capital at all times. For the smaller ones, the capital requirements would be set more simply. The latter should have a capital equal to the highest of the following requirements: their requirement of permanent minimum capital, or a quarter of their fixed overheads measured on the basis of their activity of the previous year. Concentration risk : investment firms should monitor and control their concentration risk, including in respect of their customers. Only firms that are not considered small and non-interconnected should report to competent authorities on their concentration risks. For investment firms specialised in commodity derivatives or emission allowances, which can have large concentrated exposures to the non-financial groups they belong to, these limits may be exceeded without additional capital as long as they serve group-wide liquidity or risk management purposes. Liquidity: investment firms should have internal procedures to monitor and manage their liquidity needs and be required to hold a minimum of one third of their fixed overheads requirements in liquid assets. Supervisory reporting and public disclosure : investment firms shall publicly disclose their levels of capital, their capital requirements, remuneration policies and practices, and their governance arrangements. However, small and non-interconnected firms shall not be subject to public disclosure requirements. Systemic investment firms : the proposal amends the definition of credit institutions in CRR. The status of credit institutions will be granted to large investment firms that have assets above EUR 30 billion. Large investment firms of systemic importance will continue applying CRR/CRD IV and will be fully subject to the prudential and supervisory requirements applicable to credit institutions. The European Central Bank (ECB), in the exercise of its supervisory function (single supervisory mechanism), will monitor these systemically important investment firms within the banking union. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cross-border labour mobility has notably increased in recent years. In 2017, 17 million European citizens lived or worked in a Member State other than that of their nationality. This figure almost doubled compared to a decade ago. Postings have increased by 68% from 2010 to 2.3 million in 2016. There are 1.4 million EU citizens commuting to work in another Member State. There are also over 2 million workers in the road transport sector who cross intra-EU borders on a daily basis to transport goods or passengers. The European Pillar of Social Rights ‚Äì proclaimed jointly by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017 - sets out a number of key principles and rights to support fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems. Ensuring fair labour mobility in Europe is central to this objective. As outlined in their Joint Declaration on the legislative priorities for 2018-2019, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are committed to taking action to reinforce the social dimension of the Union, by working on improving the coordination of social security systems, by protecting workers from health risks in the workplace, by ensuring fair treatment for all in the Union labour market through modernised rules on posting of workers, and by further improving cross-border enforcement of the Union law. In this context, the Commission proposes the creation of a ""European Labour Authority"" to ensure that EU rules on worker mobility are observed in a fair, simple and effective manner. This initiative will complement and facilitate the implementation of ongoing initiatives aimed at ensuring fair mobility, including through the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive and of the lex specialis on the posting of workers in international road transport operations and the modernisation of EU provisions on the coordination of social security systems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy options were considered for the proposed Authority, these being a support option, an operational option, and a supervisory option. The operational option to be performed through a new Authority that builds on existing EU level mobility bodies turned out to be the most effective way to meet the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal for a regulation aims at setting up a European Labour Authority, in the form of a decentralised EU agency, to help individuals, businesses and national administrations to make the most of the opportunities offered by free movement and to ensure a level playing field for workers' mobility. The Authority has three objectives: 1. facilitate access for individuals and employers to information on their rights and obligations as well as to relevant services. The Authority will provide information on employment, learning, mobility, recruitment and training opportunities, as well as guidance on the rights and obligations of those who live, work or are engaged in cross-border activities in another EU Member State; 2. support operational cooperation between authorities to ensure cross-border compliance with the relevant Union law, including facilitating the organisation of joint inspections. For example, the Authority will help to improve the exchange of information, support capacity building in national administrations, and assist them in carrying out joint inspections. The objectives are to enhance mutual trust between the actors, to improve day-to-day cooperation and to prevent possible fraud and abuse; 3. propose mediation and facilitate the search for solutions in the event of disputes between national authorities and cross-border disruptions of the labour market such as restructuring of companies affecting several Member States. The new Authority will pool technical and operational tasks of existing EU bodies into a permanent structure with a view to achieving improved and more efficient output In this context, the Authority will take over the management of the EURES European Coordination Office and replace: (i) the Technical Committee on the Free Movement of Workers; (ii) the Committee of Experts on Posting of Workers; (iii) he Technical Commission, the Audit Board, and the Conciliation Board of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems; (iv) replace the European Platform on tackling undeclared work. The Authority will benefit all those subject to Union rules in the field of cross-border mobility of labour and the coordination of social security, specifically, workers, whether employed or not, or any other citizen of the Union or a third-country national legally residing in the Union and in a cross-border situation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total budgetary cost for the EU of the Authority is estimated at EUR 50.9 million per year at cruising speed (which should be reached by 2023). As regards staff numbers, the Authority would need 69 establishment plan posts, 60 seconded national experts and 15 contract agents."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need for statistical information on businesses for policymaking and other purposes is growing. However, the current system for producing European business statistics is fragmented into separate domain-specific regulations which leads to inconsistencies in the data collected and inefficiencies in their production. The draft Regulation on European business statistics, amending Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 and repealing 10 legal acts in the field of business statistics (FRIBS) is part of the Commission‚Äôs REFIT Programme. This programme seeks to simplify EU law and reduce unnecessary regulatory costs. It identified business statistics as one of its priority area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is the one which seeks to modernise the European business statistics in a single framework (FRIBS) using a mix of measures, including alternative options for the modernisation of Intrastat. This option shall enable European business statistics to be put into one single legal framework FRIBS which will implicitly guarantee much higher consistency of business statistics. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics related to the structure, the economic activities and the performance of businesses, as well as on the international transactions and research and development activities of the Union economy. The proposal envisages the integration of statistical requirements and legal acts for business statistics by streamlining and simplifying them and reducing the burden on businesses. It is expected to deliver: better quality European Statistical System (ESS) business registers, common definitions to be used in all the statistical domains it covers, the exchange of identifiable micro-data and an integrated data structure. The proposed Regulation covers the following issues: data sources to be used for business statistics and statistical business registers; business statistics (subject areas and the topics) as well as the periodicity with which the topics need to be provided; business registers. The Commission (Eurostat) shall set up the EuroGroups Register of multinational enterprise groups for statistical purposes at Union level; exchange of confidential data for the purpose of intra-Union trade in goods statistics; quality, transmission and dissemination: data quality and metadata reporting, data and metadata transmission and confidentiality regarding statistical data dissemination on international trade in goods. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial impact of the proposal is of unlimited duration with a start-up period of 3 years, from 2019 to 2021. The total appropriations for 2019 and 2020 are estimated at EUR 46.453 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

BACKGROUND: with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the Union has substantially strengthened the means available to protect the financial interests of the Union by means of criminal law. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) will have the power to carry out criminal investigations and bring indictments related to criminal offences affecting the Union budget, as defined in Directive (EU) 2017/1371, in the participating Member States. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) conducts administrative investigations into administrative irregularities as well as into criminal behaviour. At the end of its investigations, it may make judicial recommendations to the national prosecution authorities, aimed at enabling indictments and prosecutions in the Member States. In future, in the Member States participating in the EPPO, it will report suspected criminal offences to the EPPO, and will collaborate with it in the context of its investigations. In view of their common goal to preserve the integrity of the Union budget, OLAF and the EPPO should establish and maintain a close relationship based on sincere cooperation and aimed at ensuring the complementarity of their respective mandates and coordination of their action, in particular as regards the scope of the enhanced cooperation for the establishment on the EPPO. The European Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) 883/2013 concerning investigations conducted by OLAF in order to ensure the highest level of protection of the Union's financial interests through synergies between the two bodies. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Regulation No 883/2013 is a consequence of the adoption of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and aims to ensure consistency in the legal framework for the protection of the Union's financial interests. It has three specific objectives: (i) adapt the operation of OLAF to the establishment of the EPPO; (i) enhance the effectiveness of OLAF‚Äôs investigative function; (iii) clarify and simplify selected provisions of Regulation No 883/2013. As the revised Regulation should be in force by the time the EPPO becomes operational, the proposal therefore contains a limited number of essential changes necessary in the short term to strengthen the framework for OLAF investigations, in order to maintain a strong and fully functioning OLAF that complements the EPPO's criminal law approach with administrative investigations, but which do not entail a change to its mandate or powers. To this end, the proposal introduces the necessary provisions into OLAF's legal framework as regards: OLAF's obligation to report without undue delay to the EPPO any conduct over which the latter may exercise its competence; the information provided to the European Public Prosecutor's Office shall be sufficiently substantiated and contain the necessary information; non-duplication of investigations : OLAF shall not open a parallel investigation into facts identical to those under investigation by the European Public Prosecutor's Office; the specific procedural rules applicable to requests from the European Public Prosecutor's Office to OLAF to support or complement the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The amendment also provides for a number of limited clarifications aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of OLAF's administrative investigations, based on the Commission's recent evaluation. The focus is on those areas where, at present, the lack of clarity in certain provisions of the existing Regulation hinders the effectiveness of OLAF's interventions. The proposal: includes rules improving the performance of on-the-spot checks and inspections: the proposed amendments maintain the current powers and would provide a clearer framework for the application of national law, thus specifying more clearly the applicable safeguards and the rights of the operators concerned. The conduct by OLAF of on-the-spot checks and inspections, where economic operators submit to a check by OLAF, is subject to Union law alone. During on-the-spot checks, the economic operator concerned would have the right not to incriminate himself and to be assisted by a person of his choice; provides OLAF with access to bank account information and provides OLAF with the necessary tools to carry out its VAT checks. The proposal specifies the obligation of Member States to assist OLAF by transmitting information relating to bank accounts. It also allows OLAF to exchange information with the Eurofisc network; introduces a principle of admissibility of OLAF reports - subject only to a verification of authenticity ‚Äì in judicial proceedings of a non-criminal nature before national courts and in administrative proceedings in the Member States. It specifies the role of the anti-fraud coordination services in the Member States in order to ensure that OLAF is provided with the assistance it needs for its investigations to be effective."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 98/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on explosive precursors aimed to limit the availability of these chemical substances to the general public, and ensure the appropriate reporting of suspicious transactions throughout the supply chain. Whilst the amount of explosives precursors available on the market for public consumption has decreased since the entry into force of the Regulation in 2013, there has been an increase in the number of reported suspicious transactions, disappearances and thefts, and explosives precursors continue to be used for the illicit manufacture of explosives. These ""homemade explosives"" have been used in the vast majority of terrorist attacks in the EU, including those in Madrid in 2004, London in 2005, Paris in 2015, Brussels in 2016, as well as Manchester and Parsons Green in 2017. The existing restrictions and controls have proven to be insufficient to prevent the illicit manufacture of homemade explosives. This is due to the facts that: (a) the Regulation allows for different levels of restrictions across Member States; (b) the requirement of registering transactions does not deter or prevent criminals from acquiring explosives precursors; (c) terrorists are developing new recipes and bomb-making techniques, which can circumvent existing restrictions and controls; (d) the Regulation lacks provisions that facilitate compliance and enforcement, which contributes to a number of systemic deficits along the supply chain. This proposal for a regulation aims to address the abovementioned problems by strengthening and clarifying Regulation (EU) No 98/2013. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: various options were analysed and compared. The preferred option is a legislative instrument revising the existing framework in order to increase the effectiveness of the restrictions, enforcement by public authorities, and compliance by the supply chain. CONTENT: this proposal for a regulation aims to strengthen the current rules on marketing and use of explosives precursors. The main points are as follows: Restrictions on additional chemicals : the Commission proposed to add new chemicals to the restricted substances that could be used to make home-made explosives. These chemicals include sulphuric acid. The proposal also lowers the concentration limit for nitromethane. Since the substances can be obtained equally in in brick-and-mortar shops as well as from online retailers and online marketplaces, the new rules will also apply fully to online sales. Ending the current registration systems : the proposal puts an end to the registration systems some Member States currently have in place. The distinction between a professional user, to which restricted explosives precursors can be made available and a member of the general public, to which they cannot, will be facilitated by introducing a definition of both concepts. Licensing: Member States may choose to have a licensing system for the purchase of a limited number of restricted substances which could have a clear legitimate use. The existing parameters for licensing are tightened. For some restricted explosives precursors above the concentration limit provided for by the Regulation, there exists no legitimate use by members of the general public. Therefore, it is proposed to discontinue licensing for potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate. Licenses may only be requested for a limited number of restricted explosives precursors for which there exists substantial legitimate use by members of the general public, i.e. only the already restricted hydrogen peroxide, nitromethane and nitric acid and the newly proposed sulphuric acid. Licences may only be provided for the latter substances in concentrations not exceeding an upper limit set in the proposal. For the newly proposed sulphuric acid, the upper limit is set at 40%. Before issuing a license to a member of the general public, each Member State will have to verify the legitimacy of such a request and run a careful security screening, including a criminal record check. Labelling: the proposal makes clear that every step in the supply chain will bear the burden of informing the next that the product supplied is subject to the restrictions of this Regulation. This can be done through a label, but also through the use of existing tools such as the safety data sheet under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. Quicker and better information sharing : the proposal introduces an obligation for businesses to report a suspicious transaction to the responsible authorities within 24 hours. The new measures also provide for greater information sharing between companies, including online businesses, and awareness raising along the whole supply chain."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the strengthening of economic governance, social indicators play an essential role in informing and supporting the Union's key priorities for growth and job creation, the reduction of poverty and social exclusion, skills, mobility and the digital economy. The EU needs reliable and timely social statistics to monitor the social situation and the impact of economic developments and policies on social conditions in the Member States and their regions, and on the situation of different groups in the population. European statistics relating to persons and households are currently collected on the basis of a number of legislative acts covering surveys on persons and households, demographic statistics, population and housing censuses and statistics mainly collected from administrative sources. Some data are also gathered from business surveys. Despite significant improvements in recent years there is a need to further integrate the collection of statistics based on surveys conducted on persons and households. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: on the basis of the results of the impact assessment, the policy options consist of: (i) consolidating existing Regulations, ‚Äòdefragment‚Äô production processes; and (ii) in the longer run, integrate governance of European social statistics collected from samples, defragment production processes used for different data collections were selected to address the fragmentation of European social statistics collected from samples. CONTENT: the purpose of the Regulation is to establish a common framework for European statistics relating to persons and households, based on data at individual level collected from samples. The statistics covered by the Regulation are organised into the domains and topics detailed in Annex I of the proposed Regulation. The data collection shall be organised into the following domains: (a) labour market, (b) income and living conditions, (c) health, (d) education and training, (e) use of information and communication technologies, (f) time use, (g) consumption. The Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts: to amend the detailed topics listed in Annex I so as to reflect relevant technical, social and economic developments and respond to the new needs of users: to establish or adapt a multiannual rolling planning in order to meet specific users' requirements that result from technological, social and economic changes. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing measures on the technical specifications of the data sets, the standards for transmission and exchange of information, the characteristics of the sampling frames and the quality reporting. Member States are expected to start data transmission to the Commission under the new Regulation in 2019. In addition, the proposal: allows and promotes the use of new forms of data collection and of alternative data sources, including administrative data and estimates obtained from modelling and big data; requires Member States to use high quality sampling frames; covers a number of other important aspects of the modernisation of European social statistics collected from samples: (i) it introduces representative feasibility and pilot studies, in order to improve the quality of the statistics and support the development and implementation of new methods; (ii) it includes provisions for financial support to be offered to Member States under certain conditions; (iii) it includes provisions for derogations to be granted that would allow Member States more time to adapt to the new requirements. Lastly, the proposed Regulation consists of five Annexes which set out the detailed information on the topics to be covered, the precision requirements, the sample characteristics, the periodicity and the deadlines for the transmission of data. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is a phasing-in period for the implementation of the proposal lasting seven years, from 2019 to 2025, the programme should however continue afterwards. Only the years of the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) have been considered in the legislative financial statement. For years 2019 and 2020, funding will come from the existing allocations to programmes and no additional funding is required. The total appropriations for 2019 and 2020 are estimated at EUR 28.814 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to amend the proposal submitted by the Commission in December 2017 for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the interoperability between EU information systems (borders and visas) and amending Council Decision 2004/512/EC, Council Regulation (EC) No 767/2008, Council Decision 2008/633/JHA, Regulation (EU) 2016/399 and Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 (see the summary of the initial proposal dated 12.12.2017). This proposal also seeks to amend the original proposal only insofar as it presents the further necessary amendments to other legal instruments that are required under the interoperability proposal. These amendments were identified as necessary in the original proposal but, because of ongoing negotiations between co-legislators on some of the systems concerned, it was not possible to include the necessary amendments in the original proposal. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation, together with the proposed Regulation on interoperability (police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration), creates a framework to ensure interoperability between the entry/exit system (EES), the Visa Information System (VIS), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), Eurodac, the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN) so that these systems and their data supplement each other. Elements of the interoperability framework: the framework shall consist of the following elements of interoperability: Objectives: the proposed Regulation: By ensuring interoperability, the proposal shall have the following objectives: Scope: the proposed Regulation applies to the Entry/Exit System (EES), the Visa Information System (VIS), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and the Schengen Information System (SIS). It applies to persons in respect of whom personal data may be processed in the EU information systems. Consequences for other legal instruments: the proposal includes detailed provisions for the necessary changes to the draft legal instruments that are currently stable texts as provisionally agreed by the co-legislators: the proposed Regulations on ETIAS, on SIS in the field of border checks, and on eu-LISA. However, the two amending proposals on interoperability do not include the amendments relating to Eurodac, the EU asylum and irregular migration database, given that discussions have not yet been concluded on the May 2016 legislative proposal to strengthen Eurodac. Once the co-legislators reach agreement on the legislative proposal to strengthen Eurodac, or have achieved sufficient progress, the Commission will present the related amendments to the interoperability proposals within two weeks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendments necessitated an update of the legislative financial statement accordingly. The total budget required over nine years (2019-2027) is estimated at EUR 461.0 million, which includes the following elements: EUR 261.3 million for eu-LISA. A specific budget of EUR 36.3 million covers the cost of upgrading the network and the central SIS (Schengen Information System) for the estimated increase of searches that is likely to occur as a result of interoperability;"

CONTENT: the proposed Regulation, together with the proposed Regulation on interoperability (police and judicial cooperation, asylum and migration), creates a framework to ensure interoperability between the entry/exit system (EES), the Visa Information System (VIS), the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), Eurodac, the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN) so that these systems and their data supplement each other. Elements of the interoperability framework: the framework shall consist of the following elements of interoperability: Objectives: the proposed Regulation: By ensuring interoperability, the proposal shall have the following objectives: Scope: the proposed Regulation applies to Eurodac, the Schengen Information System (SIS) and [the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN). It also applies to the Europol data to the extent of enabling querying it simultaneously to the EU information systems and to persons in respect of whom personal data may be processed in the EU information systems and in the Europol data. Consequences for other legal instruments: the proposal includes detailed provisions for the necessary changes to the draft legal instruments that are currently stable texts as provisionally agreed by the co-legislators: the proposed Regulations on ETIAS, on SIS in the field of border checks, and on eu-LISA. It is also proposed to make the necessary changes to the text as it stood on 31 May 2018 for ECRIS-TCN. However, the two amending proposals on interoperability do not include the amendments relating to Eurodac, the EU asylum and irregular migration database, given that discussions have not yet been concluded on the May 2016 legislative proposal to strengthen Eurodac. Once the co-legislators reach agreement on the legislative proposal to strengthen Eurodac, or have achieved sufficient progress, the Commission will present the related amendments to the interoperability proposals within two weeks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendments necessitated an update of the legislative financial statement accordingly. The total budget required over nine years (2019-2027) is estimated at EUR 461.0 million, which includes the following elements: EUR 261.3 million for eu-LISA. A specific budget of EUR 36.3 million covers the cost of upgrading the network and the central SIS (Schengen Information System) for the estimated increase of searches that is likely to occur as a result of interoperability;"

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: there are almost 500 immigration liaison officers (referred as ILOs) currently deployed by Member States to third countries. The existing Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 on ILOs sets out the obligation to establish local or regional cooperation networks among immigration liaison officers of Member States and outlines the objectives of such cooperation, as well as ILOs' tasks in relation to the third country and their responsibilities vis-√†-vis the sending Member State. The evaluation of the current ILO Regulation confirmed that ILOs and their networks remain relevant in the current global migration context and consistent with existing and planned EU migration policies. It also highlighted that this Regulation had a limited and above all indirect impact on the establishment of formal networks between ILOs deployed in the same place, on the intensification of the collection and sharing of information and on the improvement of the coordination of the EU's position and activities towards third countries. The Commission therefore proposes to review legislation on ILOs deployed by EU Member States in third countries in order to help strengthen the European dimension of coordination with key stakeholders. This proposal responds to the calls of the European Parliament and the European Council to develop coherent and credible policy with regards to preventing and countering illegal migration, tackling migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings, enhancing return of illegally staying third-country nationals and managing effectively the external borders of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal to recast Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 lays down the general principles for the creation a European network of immigration liaison officers deployed by Member States as well as the Commission and Union Agencies to third countries with the objective of contributing to managing migration effectively and ensuring a high level of internal security within the European Union. strengthen the rules governing the sharing of strategic information with the Union Agencies, ensuring that this becomes a two-way process and Member State ILOs access the relevant Agencies' analytical products in a more systematic manner and are further assisted in fulfilling their tasks in locations; closer coordination both at network management and at regional operational level of immigration liaison officers deployed by Member States, the Commission and Union agencies. In order to strengthen the governance of a European network of ILOs, the proposal: further clarifies the definition of immigration liaison officer, making an explicit reference to law enforcement liaison officers working on immigration-related tasks; introduces a Steering Board at the European level to strengthen among Member States, the Commission and the Union Agencies the network management and coordination of immigration liaison officers deployed to third countries; introduces reporting requirements to be agreed by the Steering Board, which will include follow-up actions, and also introduces the possibility for the Steering Board to commission ad-hoc targeted information requests; reinforces information exchange between immigration liaison officers as well as members of the Steering Board via a secured web-based platform; provides legal certainty as to processing of personal data by immigration liaison officers for the purpose of fulfilling tasks and activities defined by the proposal. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total cost of implementing the proposal is estimated at EUR 17.3 million over a nine-year period starting in 2019, of which EUR 1.6 million to support the functioning of the Steering Board, EUR 12 million for the implementation of the activities of a European network of ILOs and EUR 3.5 million estimated for the deployment of the immigration liaison officers by the Commission. If the proposal is adopted before the next financial framework, the necessary resources (estimated at EUR 860 000) shall be financed from the current ISF Borders and Visas budget line and the amounts shall be deducted from the total allocation of EUR 17.3 million for the implementation of this proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative is part of the third ‚ÄòEurope on the Move‚Äô mobility package which delivers the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017. The aim is to ensure a smooth transition to a safe, clean, connected and automated mobility system and to create an environment where EU companies can produce the best, cleanest and most competitive products. Road safety is a pan-European issue that is addressed through an integrated approach. Policies are traditionally structured around three pillars: road users (drivers, pedestrians and cyclists), vehicles and infrastructure. Over the past decades, road safety significantly improved. However, progress in the reduction of road fatalities rates has stalled in recent years. A revised framework better adapted to the changes in mobility resulting from societal trends is necessary. The current proposal addresses the main problem of persistent high number of road accidents that in turn leads to a high number of fatalities and severe injuries and provides measures to increase safety at vehicle level so as to either avoid and lower the number of accidents or lower the severity of un-avoided accidents to limit the number of fatalities and severe injuries. This proposal has to be viewed in close relation with other initiatives such as, for example, the proposal to amend the directive on road infrastructure safety management. IMPACT ANALYSIS: the preferred choice, namely, the 'Introduction of a full set of safety features boosting innovation' is expected to reduce the number of deaths and serious injuries by 24 794 and 140 740 respectively over a period of 16 years. The expected present value benefit amount to EUR 72.8 billion. Road congestion should also be reduced due to avoided collisions. Lastly, a reduction in vehicle emissions and an improvement in air quality should also be achieved. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation aims to introduce harmonised technical requirements concerning the safety and environmental performance of motor vehicles and their trailers. In general, it refers to the Regulation on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, since both Regulations share a compatible time line for their application. In particular, the proposal aims to: extends the scope of the currently applicable requirement to fit passenger cars with a tyre pressure monitoring system to cover all vehicle categories; mandates a range of advanced vehicle safety features for all vehicles (e.g. the intelligent speed assistance; driver drowsiness and attention monitoring/distraction recognition systems; reversing detection; alcohol interlock installation facilitation). The proposal also lays down specific requirements: for cars and vans , including a requirement that they be equipped with an event (accident) data recorder and designed and constructed with an enlarged head impact protection zone for vulnerable road users; for frontal protection systems ; for trucks and buses , in particular by requiring them to be equipped with a system for detecting and warning the presence of vulnerable road users in the immediate vicinity of the front and nearside of the vehicle and to be designed and constructed in such a way so as to improve the visibility of vulnerable road users from driver's seat; for hydrogen-powered vehicles : Annex V contains the requirements for the qualification of materials used for hydrogen systems and their components; for automated vehicles : the proposal lays down specific requirements for automated vehicles and, in particular provides a list of areas of safety, for which detailed rules and technical provisions need to be further developed as a basis for the deployment of automated vehicles. The Commission believes that mandating advanced safety features for vehicles will help the drivers to gradually get accustomed to the new features and will enhance public trust and acceptance in the transition toward autonomous driving."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: t he European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal notes that international measures exist to promote responsible sourcing of minerals in areas at risk or affected by armed conflict. The two best-known were adopted in 2011 and 2010 respectively: the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Due Diligence Guidance) and Section 1502 of the United States Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which focuses on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and nine adjoining countries. Whilst the trade of conflict minerals is very well documented in the case of the DRC, other cases abound elsewhere in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Against this background, the Commission and the High Representative have been working to develop a comprehensive EU responsible mineral sourcing framework. This work follows up a 2010 European Parliament resolution calling for the EU to legislate along the lines of US legislation as well as two Communications in 2011 and 2012 that announced the Commission's intention to explore ways of improving supply chain transparency. It should be noted that this legislative proposal is accompanied by a Communication detailing other policy measures that can be deployed to tackle the problem as broadly as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission examined six options. The preferred option comprises the adoption of a Regulation establishing obligations under a 'EU Responsible Importer' certification based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance ‚Äì voluntary. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to help reduce the financing of armed groups and security forces through mineral proceeds in conflict-affected and high-risk areas by supporting and further promoting responsible sourcing practices of EU companies in relation to tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold originating from such areas. The draft regulation lays down the supply chain due diligence obligations of Union importers who choose to be self-certified as responsible importers of minerals or metals containing or consisting of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, as set out in Annex I. Self-certification as a responsible importer : a ny importer of minerals or metals within the scope of the Regulation may self-certify as responsible importer by declaring to a Member State competent authority that it adheres to the supply chain due diligence obligations set out in the Regulation. The declaration shall contain documentation in which the importer confirms its adherence to the obligations including results of the independent third-party audits carried out. Member State competent authorities shall carry out appropriate ex-post checks in order to ensure that self-certified responsible importers of the minerals or metals within the scope of this Regulation comply with their obligations. OECD Due Diligence Guidance : the Regulation relies on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to define obligations for EU importers that opt to be self-certified as responsible importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten ores and metals, and gold, on the basis of a self-declaration of compliance. EU importers opting for self-certification are obliged to integrate all elements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance in their management system by: (i) maintaining a system of controls and transparency over the mineral supply chain, which includes inter alia the country of mineral origin and the smelters/refiners; (ii) identifying and assessing risks in the supply chain against the OECD model supply chain policy; (iii) designing and implementing a strategy to respond to identified risks; (iv) obtaining independent third-party audit assurances of supply chain due diligence; and (v) reporting publicly on supply chain due diligence. Disclosure : the EU self-certified importer is required to disclose annually to the Member State competent authority the identity and geographical location of the smelters/refiners in its supply chain. The importer is also required to provide independent third-party audit assurances and pass them on to Member States' competent authorities and to downstream purchasers, with due regard to business confidentiality and other competitive concerns. On the basis of the information disclosed to the competent authorities, the EU will publish annually, after consultation with the OECD, a list of responsible smelters and refiners that source according to the Regulation. Infringement: in the case of infringement, competent authorities will issue a notice of remedial action to be taken by the EU importer. If such action is inadequate, the authority will then issue a non-recognition notice for the responsible importer certificate for the minerals and metals covered by the draft Regulation. Budgetary implications: the present proposal entails limited financial implications for the Union budget for administrative purposes: EUR 2.72 million for the period 2014-2018."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a number of amendments are to be made to Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 concerning the establishment of a Community framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector and support for scientific advice regarding the Common Fisheries Policy. In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast. Data collection is essential for the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), as a basis for founding it on the best possible scientific advice. Data are needed to evaluate the state of fish stocks, the profitability of the different segments of the sector and the effects of fisheries and aquaculture on the ecosystem. Data are also needed to evaluate EU policies. For this reason, an EU framework for the collection and management of fisheries data was established in 2000, and then reformed in 2008 resulting in the Data Collection Framework (DCF). The 2013 reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) by Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 needs to be matched by adaptations in the supporting scientific advice and therefore the data needed for it. This is particularly relevant in order to achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY) at the latest by 2020, to manage fisheries taking account of their impacts on the ecosystem, and to gradually introduce a landing obligation. The reform of the CFP also requires changes in the way data are obtained, e.g. regionalisation and devolution of tasks from the European Union to Member States in the context of regional cooperation. The revision of the DCF is part of the Commission's Regulatory Fitness Programme (REFIT) which seeks to cut red tape and remove regulatory burden. CONTENT: the changes to be made to the rules laid down in Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008 are essential because of the new needs arising from the CFP reform. The proposal retains the key provisions of the current system: the establishment of an EU Multi-annual Programme, to be implemented by national Data Collection plans; key obligations in the form of commitments by Member States in relation to collection, storage, protection and provision of data; provisions on rights and obligations of end-users of data; and provisions on cooperation within and between Member States, as well as with and between scientific and management bodies. The proposed modifications compared to the current DCF Regulation are presented as follows: remove overlaps and seeking synergies between EU legislations and reducing costs of the entire system of marine data. The DCF will only create data collection obligations insofar as they are not already covered by other EU legislation; maximise synergies with environmental law : the current DCF does not provide sufficient data on some ecosystem impacts of fisheries which are however required for implementing efficiently the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This is the case of incidental catches of protected species (birds, marine mammals, turtles etc.), effects on food webs (predator-prey relations), and the impact of fishing on habitats; reduce the level of prescriptions set at EU level without compromising data quality : the legislation should be more result-oriented and leave more flexibility to Member States regarding implementation. By ensuring more and earlier involvement of the Member States, in the context of regional cooperation, on decision making about methodologies to be followed or quality targets to be met, the DCF can be greatly simplified and the data collection system made more flexible; reduce the details decided by or reported to the Commission : currently, national programmes describe in great detail what will be done, how and by whom in each Member State. The objective is to reduce this significantly. With the move away from triennial to multi-annual EU and national programmes, Member States will be in a position to plan their work over a longer period; collect once, use several times : the Commission proposes, as a first proposal, to make the DCF the main legal instrument by which Member States are to provide any data necessary to data users (end-users and other interested parties), whatever the source of the legal obligation under which data are collected (DCF or any other EU legislation). The second proposal should enhance cooperation between Member States to develop compatible data storage and exchange systems and formats in line with those agreed under Directive 2007/2/EC and promote compatibility between data formats used under other Union legislation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: none which are not already foreseen in the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : acts of terrorism constitute one of the most serious violations of the universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity, the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on which the European Union is founded. They are serious attacks on the principles of democracy and the rule of law on which the European Union is founded. The terrorist threat has grown and evolved in recent years. Individuals referred to as ""foreign terrorist fighters"" travel abroad for terrorism purposes. Returning foreign terrorist fighters pose a heightened security threat to all EU Member States. In addition, the European Union and its Member States face increased threats from individuals inspired or instructed by terrorist groups abroad but who remain within Europe. By late 2014, the overall number of people who have departed from the EU to conflict areas was estimated to have exceeded 3000 and is now assessed to have reached 5000 while at the same time the number of returnees was reported to have increased in some Member States. As emphasised by Europol, ""individuals who have travelled to conflict zones will continue to pose a heightened threat to all EU Member States.‚Äô The attacks carried out on European soil in the course of 2014 and 2015, culminating in the recent attacks in Paris on the night of 13 November 2015, tragically illustrated that this risk can materialise Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA already criminalises certain terrorist acts, including in particular the commission of terrorist attacks, participation in the activities of a terrorist group, including financial support to these activities, public provocation, recruitment and training to terrorism as well as rules on aiding and abetting, incitement and attempt of terrorist offences. However, Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA needs to be reviewed to implement new international standards and obligations taken by the EU and to tackle the evolving terrorist threat in a more effective way, thereby enhancing the security of the EU and the safety of its citizens. Victims of terrorism also require protection, support and assistance that respond to their specific needs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given the urgent need to improve the EU framework to increase security in the light of recent terrorist attacks including by incorporating international obligations and standards, the proposal is exceptionally presented without an impact assessment. CONTENT: the proposal replaces Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and seeks to put in place updated EU level legislation establishing minimum rules on the definition of terrorist offences, offenses related to a terrorist group or terrorist activities and penalties in this area. It also provides specific measures on protection, support and assistance to the victims of terrorism. The proposed directive transposes into EU law international law obligations, such as those flowing from the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2178(2014) on foreign terrorist fighters, the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the prevention of terrorism and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Recommendations concerning terrorist financing. Terrorist offences : the proposal defines which offences should be considered as terrorist offences in Member States. This provision was contained in Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and remained unchanged since then. The main aim of this key provision is to approximate the definition of terrorist offences in all Member States by introducing a specific and common qualification of certain acts as terrorist offences. Offences relating to a terrorist group: the proposal requires Member States to criminalise the running of or participation in the activities of a terrorist group, with knowledge of the fact that such participation will contribute to the criminal activities of the terrorist group. Offences relating to terrorist activities : the proposal requires Member States to criminalise: a public provocation to commit a terrorist offence , where this is committed intentionally (e.g. the glorification of suicide bombers, encouragement to join violent jihad, direct invitations to kill non-believers, justification of terrorism or the dissemination of messages or images of brutal assassinations); recruitment for terrorism : the aim is to provide adequate criminal justice tools to stem extensive recruitment activities by individuals or recruitment networks; providing training for terrorism, e.g. providing instruction in the making or use of explosives, firearms or other weapons or noxious or hazardous substances, for the purpose of committing a terrorist offence. This is meant to capture the dissemination of instructions and (online) manuals intended for training or planning of attacks and more specifically the dissemination (through the internet) of information on terrorist methods, thus functioning as a ‚Äòvirtual training camp‚Äô; receiving training : this will provide law enforcement and prosecutors with additional tools to tackle the threats resulting from potential perpetrators, including those ultimately acting alone, by offering the possibility to investigate and prosecute training activities having the potential to lead to the commission of terrorist offences; travelling abroad for terrorism : this offence targets primarily the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters by criminalising travelling to another country for terrorist purposes. The provision covers both the travel to third countries, as well as to EU Member States, including those of the nationality or residence of the perpetrator. The travel to the State of destination may be direct or by transiting other States en route; organising or otherwise facilitating travelling abroad for terrorism , e.g. by purchasing tickets and planning of itineraries, or any other conduct which assists the traveller in reaching his or her destination, including by assisting the traveller in unlawfully crossing a border. In addition to acting intentionally, the perpetrator must know that the assistance is rendered for the purpose of terrorism; terrorist financing : it is not necessary that the offence is actually committed or that a link is established to a specific terrorist offence. The funds may come from a single source, e.g. as a loan or a gift which is provided to the traveller by a person or legal entity, or from various sources through some kind of collection organised by one or more persons or legal entities. other offences, such as aggravated theft, extortion and fraud to commit terrorist offences, and drawing up false administrative documents to committing a terrorist offence. Aiding or abetting, inciting and attempting : Member States are required to criminalise aiding or abetting, inciting and attempting to commit a terrorist offence, such as providing the financial resources for the execution of a terrorist attack, to the provision of supportive services or material such as (means of) transportation, weapons, explosives or shelter. A person instigating another person to actively recruit others or to travel abroad for terrorist purposes would therefore be covered. Protection of and assistance to victims of terrorism: the proposal sets out new rules complementing Directive 2012/29/EU on victims rights so that victims of terrorism have access to a long-term emotional and psychological support and assistance, whether legal, practical or financial, in the place where they live."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: control at external borders remains one of the main safeguards of the area without controls at internal borders. The phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters, many of whom are Union citizens, demonstrates the necessity to strengthen the checks at external borders with regard to Union citizens. It is estimated that up to 5 000 EU citizens departed to the conflict zones (notably Syria and Iraq) and most probably joined ISIS forces. Many of the perpetrators of recent terrorist attacks, starting from Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, stayed or were trained abroad in the areas controlled by the terrorist organisations. This proposal replies to the call expressed in the Council conclusions of 19 and 20 November, which invited the Commission to present a proposal for a targeted revision of the Schengen Borders Code to provide for systematic controls of EU nationals, including the verification of biometric information, against relevant databases at external borders of the Schengen area, making full use of technical solutions in order not to hamper the fluidity of movement. This proposal is a response to the increase of terrorist threats in Europe as manifested by the attacks in Paris, Copenhagen and Brussels, but should address all potential risks to internal security. CONTENT: this proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). The amended proposal: obliges Member States to carry out systematic checks on persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law (i.e. EU citizens and members of their families who are not EU citizens) when they cross the external border against databases on lost and stolen documents as well as in order to verify that those persons do not represent a threat to public order and internal security. This obligation shall apply at all external borders i.e. at air, sea and land borders, both at entry and exit; enables Member States, where a systematic consultation of databases on all the persons enjoying the right of free movement under Union law could lead to disproportionate impact on the flow of traffic at the border, to carry out only targeted checks against databases provided that a risk assessment shows this does not lead to risks related to internal security, public policy, international relations of the Member States or a threat to the public health. The risk analysis should be communicated to Frontex and should be the subject of regular reporting to the Commission and to Frontex; reinforces the need to verify biometric identifiers as contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004. This Regulation introduced the facial image and fingerprints as security elements in the passport of EU citizens in order to render them more secure and establish a reliable link between the holder and the passport. Therefore in case of doubts on the authenticity of the passport or on the identity of the holder, border guards should verify those biometric identifiers; removes the margin left to Member States not to check third country nationals on exit : the amendment will align the obligations to check systematically also on exit that a third country national does not present a threat to public policy and internal security. The United Kingdom and Ireland shall not take part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part entered into force on 1 March 2000. Liberalisation measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products were introduced into the Association Agreement by an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco (the Liberalisation Agreement), which entered into force in 2012. Since the Association Agreement entered into force, the Union has continued to strengthen its bilateral relations with Morocco and awarded it advanced status in 2008 which enshrines the strength of the bilateral links between the parties and their shared ambitions and commitments with a view to the advancement of their joint initiatives, such as good governance and political and socio-economic reforms. At the same time, the Union has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to resolving the dispute in Western Sahara. Although it has not recognised Morocco‚Äôs sovereignty over Western Sahara, it fully supports the efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General and his personal envoy to help the parties reach a fair, lasting and mutually-acceptable political solution that would ensure the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara under agreements aligned with the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in the Resolutions of the UN Security Council, in particular Resolutions 2152 (2014) and 2218 (2015). In its judgment of 21 December 2016 in Case C-104/16 P3, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the Association Agreement and the Liberalisation Agreement between the Union and Morocco did not apply to Western Sahara. Following the Court judgment, the practice of applying the trade preferences set out in the Association Agreement and its protocols on a de facto basis to products originating in Western Sahara, a non-self-governing territory, could not continue, unless Protocol 1 (access to the EU market for Moroccan agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products) and Protocol 4 (concerning rules of origin) were amended to establish that products originating in Western Sahara should be treated in the same way as those from Morocco. On 29 May 2017, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Morocco with a view to establishing a legal basis to grant the tariff preferences laid down in the Association Agreement to products originating in Western Sahara. An agreement between the EU and Morocco is the only means of ensuring that the import of products originating in Western Sahara benefits from preferential origin, given that only the Moroccan authorities are able to ensure compliance with the rules necessary for the granting of such preferences. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the amendment of Protocols 1 and 4 to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part. This proposal applies amendments to Protocol 4 and Protocol 1 of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement with a view to respecting the obligations of the Court judgment of 21 December 2016 and providing a legal basis for granting preferences to products from Western Sahara. The aim of the proposal is to: These measures will prevent Western Sahara suffering a competitive disadvantage and missing out on investment opportunities compared with neighbouring countries, which benefit from tariff preferences on different grounds (association agreements or the Generalised System of Preferences). Lastly, it should be emphasised that the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16 relates to the partnership agreement between the EU and Morocco in the fishing industry. This is a separate issue from the matter of market access, which is covered by the Association Agreement and therefore this proposal. Any agreement is understood to be purely provisional, pending the resolution of the dispute through the UN and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. On this point, the Agreement states that it is concluded without prejudice to the respective positions of the European Union and Morocco with regard to the status of Western Sahara."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the WTO panel report adopted on 19 April 2017 in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings DS492 - measures affecting tariff concessions on certain poultry meat products brought by China against the European Union, the EU needed to comply with the findings. In particular, the panel found that when allocating quantities within tariff rate quotas to supplying countries under WTO rules, the EU should have taken into account as a ‚Äòspecial factor‚Äô China's increased ability to export poultry products to the EU following the relaxation of sanitary measures in July 2008. The reasonable period of time for the implementation of the Panel Report under the WTO rules began on 19 April 2017. On 12 March 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a mutually agreed solution with China. Those negotiations were concluded and an agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and China was initialled on 18 June 2018. The agreement was signed on behalf of the Union subject to its conclusion at a later date. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and China in relation to DS492 European Union - measures affecting tariff concessions on certain poultry meat products. The Agreement seeks to open the following tariff rate quotas (TRQ): The Commission shall adopt implementing Regulations to expand and manage the relevant quotas. These implementation measures are being prepared in parallel with this proposal. Once the quotas are opened, the EU and China shall notify the Agreement to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body as a mutually agreed solution in relation to the dispute DS492. The Commission also needs to provide for transparent and appropriate tariff quota management. Lastly, the Agreement shall also respect rights of other suppliers, which were agreed in the context of past Article XXVIII GATT negotiations."

BACKGROUND: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) - initially established for the programming period 2007-2013 - is a concrete expression of EU solidarity with European workers who lost their jobs. It was set up to provide support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns caused by globalisation and whose redundancies have a significant adverse impact on the regional or local economy. Union involvement through the EGF complements national measures in order to re-integrate dismissed workers by offering them a unique combination of tailored measures that lead to more sustainable results, increase the self-esteem of beneficiaries, who finally have a more proactive approach to job seeking, and improve their employability. Experience achieved so far with the EGF indicates that the help offered would not have been available without the involvement of the EGF. For the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, the scope of the EGF has been extended by Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which has to be revised by the end of 2020. The prime objective of this proposal is to ensure that the EGF continues to operate beyond 31 December 2020, to enlarge its objective offer and to amend some technical details in order to have more coherence and synergies, flexibility, focus on performance, and simplification. IMPACT ANALYSIS: the most important finding regarding the EGF is that as an emergency assistance fund, the EGF should remain outside the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States ‚Äì seeks to establish the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It lays down the objectives of the EGF, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding, including applications by the Member States for financial contributions from the EGF for measures targeting the eligible beneficiaries. Mission and objectives of the EGF : it is proposed to explicitly include in the mission the role played by the EGF in contributing to the implementation of the principles defined under the European Pillar of Social Rights. In addition, the specific objective of the EGF is to offer assistance in case of unexpected major restructuring events, particularly those caused by globalisation-related challenges, such as: changes in world trade patterns; trade disputes; financial or economic crises; the transition to low-carbon economy; or as a consequence of digitisation or automation. Particular emphasis shall lie on measures that help the most disadvantaged groups. Intervention criteria : the Commission proposes to lower the threshold of displaced workers for a case to be eligible, from 500 to 250 within a reference period of four months (or 6 months in sectoral cases). This is because there is a general trend of fewer very large scale redundancies and because the dismissal of 250 workers usually has a significant impact in most regions. This is also to acknowledge the fact that in many Member States, most workers are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A new provision has been added allowing Member States to apply for EGF assistance if redundancies occur in the same region but in different economic sectors. Eligible measures : as a change to the current Regulation, the inclusion of the dissemination of skills required in the digital age shall be a mandatory horizontal element of any coordinated package of personalised services offered. The proposed measures shall be based on the personal needs and qualifications of the beneficiary. Technical assistance from the Commission : this assistance shall support any measures necessary to implement the proposed Regulation. This amount could reach up to 0.5 % of the annual maximum amount of the EGF. This is higher than in the current programming period. This shall also include additional measures to increase networking and the exchange of good practice between Member States. Amount of financial contribution : the Fund's co-financing rate which currently stands at 60%, will be aligned with the highest ESF+ co-financing rates for a given Member State. In several cases this would mean that the EU co-finances a higher share of the total cost. Eligibility period : the standard period for the implementation of EGF measures shall remain at 24 months. However, the proposal stipulates that the 24-month period shall be counted from the time the decision to mobilise the EGF is adopted and not from the date of application for EGF support. Funding allocated to the EGF : the EGF is not included in the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. The maximum amount that can be used by the EGF for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 1.57 billion (in current prices), or an average of EUR 225 million per year."
5438,5003,206.0,2.0,16.01.2019,Specific provisions for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg),***I,Leg,Draft legislative resolution,s,Arimont,A8-0470/2018,2018/0199/COD,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A8-2018-0470&language=EN,Committee on Regional Development,Regional development,vote: Commission proposal ,1.0,,0,RCV,+,570,80,25,7.0,19.0,3.0,44.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,31.0,0.1,0.396,0.014,0.88,0.096,0.015,0.016,0.596,0,0,0,0,https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2018/0199(COD),https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/summary.do?id=1536127&t=e&l=en,"PURPOSE: to lay down the specific provisions for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) supported by the European Regional Development Fund and external financing instruments for the period 2021-2017. BACKGROUND: in order to simplify the legislative structure and ensure clarity of the applicable provisions in the field of cohesion, the common provisions regulation (CPR) lays down common rules and specific rules for the Funds. So goes for the Regulation covering both the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund intervening under ‚ÄòInvestment for jobs and growth‚Äô and, for the ERDF, under the ‚ÄòEuropean territorial cooperation‚Äô goal (Interreg). As part of a major simplification effort, the Commission now proposes to adopt specific provisions in relation to the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) where one or more Member States cooperate across borders with regard to effective programming. The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) actively promotes territorial cooperation. The 13 ENPI (European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument) CBC programmes implemented during the 2007-2013 period covered nine EU land borders, three sea basins and one sea crossing. The programmes involved 34 countries, 19 EU Member States and 12 of the 16 neighbourhood partner countries plus Norway, Russia and Turkey CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) with a view to fostering cooperation between Member States inside the Union and between Member States and adjacent third countries, partner countries, other territories or overseas countries and territories (OCTs) respectively. ¬∑ With regard to support from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III), the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the funding for all the OCTs for the period 2021 to 2027, the proposal defines additional specific objectives as well as the integration of those funds into Interreg programmes, the criteria for third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible and certain specific implementation rules. ¬∑ With regard to support from the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the Union (the Interreg funds) to Interreg programmes, this proposed Regulation defines the Interreg-specific objectives as well as the organisation, the criteria for Member States, third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible, the financial resources, and the criteria for their allocation. European territorial cooperation (Interreg) objective strands : support shall be provided by the ERDF and, where appropriate, by the Union's external financing instruments for the following five components: (i) cross-border; (ii) transnational and maritime; (iii) outermost regions; (iv) interregional cooperation and; (v) the new interregional innovation investments. Geographical coverage : the cross-border cooperation component shall focus on NUTS level 3 regions of the Union along all internal and external land borders with third countries or partner countries, while cross-border cooperation along maritime borders shall be integrated into the broader ‚Äòtransnational and maritime cooperation‚Äô component. The Commission stresses that access to public services such as hospitals and universities is generally more difficult in border regions. Moreover, navigating between different administrative and legal systems is still often complex and costly. The proposal therefore aims to help cross-border cooperation programmes to focus on institutional cooperation, solving border problems and investment in common services of public interest. Transnational cooperation shall cover larger territories on the mainland of the Union, whereas maritime cooperation shall cover territories around sea-basins and integrate cross-border cooperation on maritime borders during the programming period 2014-2020. A specific outermost regions‚Äô component shall be established in order to enable outermost regions to cooperate with their neighbouring countries and territories in the most effective and simple way. The list of Interreg programmes to receive financial support shall be set out in an implementing act adopted by the European Commission. Specific objectives : taking into account the special features of Interreg, two Interreg-specific objectives are set out: (i) 'better Interreg governance'; and (ii) 'a safer and more secure Europe', The proposed Regulation also sets out specific percentages for thematic concentration. Programming, monitoring, eligibility : the proposal: (i) clarifies the rules governing funds for small projects that offer real added value and play an important role in building trust between citizens and institutions; (ii) ensures consistent monitoring of performance by refining the common set of performance indicators; (iii) establishes a clear hierarchy between the EU eligibility rules, the specific rules for Interreg programmes and, finally, the national eligibility rules. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The ERDF resources for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) shall amount to EUR 8.43 billion of the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the ERDF, ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund for the 2021-2027 programming period. The resources shall be allocated as follows: 52.7% (EUR 4.44 billion in total) for cross-border cooperation (component 1); 31.4% (EUR 2.65 billion in total) for transnational cooperation and maritime cooperation (component 2); 3.2% (EUR 270.1 million in total) for outermost regions‚Äô cooperation (component 3); 1.2% (EUR 100 million in total) for interregional cooperation (component 4); 11.5 % (a total of EUR 970 million) for interregional innovation investments (component 5)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the UK's withdrawal from the EU has implications beyond the bilateral relationship between the EU and the UK, in particular with regard to their commitments under the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization (WTO). Both the EU and the UK are original Members of the WTO. After Brexit, the EU will continue to apply its scheduled commitments for goods, but its existing quantitative commitments, in particular the tariff rate quotas for agricultural, fish and industrial products, will require adjustments to take into account the fact that the EU's WTO schedule will no longer be applicable to the UK. In October 2017, the EU and the UK informed WTO members in a joint letter of their approach for apportioning the existing EU tariff quotas and began informal talks with partners. The proposed approach would provide for an apportionment based on an objective methodology reflecting existing levels of market access and trade flows under each tariff rate quota This initiative is in line with the EUs ongoing actions to prepare for the withdrawal of the UK from the EU in an orderly manner, notably the joint EU-UK letter to the WTO Membership of 11 October 2017. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation provides that the tariff rate quotas figuring in the EU‚Äôs WTO schedule of concessions and commitments will be apportioned between the EU and the UK as follows: as regards tariff rate quotas for agricultural products, the Union‚Äôs portion shall be as set out in Part A of the Annex to this Regulation; as regards tariff rate quotas for non-agricultural products, the Union‚Äôs portion shall be as set out in Part B of the Annex to this Regulation. Part B of the Annex shall replace Annex 1 to Regulation (EC) No 32/2000, where these tariff rate quotas are currently listed. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to amend the Annex to the proposed Regulation and Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 32/2000 in order to change the apportionment to cover for agreements concluded with trading partners in the meantime, for the case that following negotiations with trading partners it becomes evident that the mathematical application of the method used for the apportionment is not appropriate for a specific tariff rate quota or for the case that other pertinent information relating to a specific tariff rate quota comes to the knowledge of the Commission at a later stage. This Regulation should apply from the moment that Union's WTO schedule ceases to apply to the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation is part of the EU's common visa policy for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Suspension mechanism : the suspension mechanism in Article 1a of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 allows the temporary suspension of the visa exemption for nationals of a third country in certain emergency situations, as a last resort. It can be triggered by any Member State by notifying the Commission that it is confronted, over a six-month period, in comparison with the same period in the previous year or with the last six months prior to the visa liberalisation of that country, with circumstances leading to an emergency situation which the Member State in question cannot remedy on its own. These circumstances are namely a substantial and sudden increase in the number of: nationals of that third country found to be illegally overstaying in the Member State in question; unfounded asylum applications from the nationals of that third country, where such increase is leading to specific pressures on the Member State‚Äôs asylum system; rejected readmission applications submitted by the Member State to that third country for its own nationals. The Commission may decide that action is needed, taking into account the consequences of the suspension of the visa exemption for the external relations of the Union and its Member States with the third country concerned, while working in close cooperation with that third country to find alternative long-term solutions. In that case, the Commission has three months from the receipt of the notification to adopt an implementing act temporarily suspending the exemption from the visa requirement for the nationals of the third country concerned, for a period of six months. Before the expiry of this six-month period, the Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council. This report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to transfer the third country in question to the list of visa-required countries (Annex I), and thus to put its citizens permanently under the visa requirement. In such case, the temporary suspension of the visa waiver may be extended by a maximum period of 12 months. Migration crisis : in the context of the current migratory situation in the European Union and of the successful conclusion of several visa liberalisation dialogues with neighbouring countries (Georgia, Ukraine, Kosovo, Turkey), several Member States have questioned whether the existing visa suspension mechanism provides for the necessary flexibility to act in certain situations of urgency. In particular they have argued that: the possible grounds for suspension are too limited, and for instance do not include the failure of a third country to cooperate on readmission of third-country nationals having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the Union or a Member State and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation; the initiative to trigger the suspension mechanism by means of a notification, which in the Regulation lies solely with Member States, should be extended to Commission; the reference periods and the deadlines are too long, which does not allow for a fast reaction in emergency situations. Taking into account the Commission's recent proposals for visa liberalisation of Georgia, Ukraine, Turkey and Kosovo and the recent discussions with Member States, the Commission has decided to present a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to revise the current suspension mechanism. This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the main objective is to strengthen the suspension mechanism by making it easier for Member States to notify circumstances leading to a possible suspension and by enabling the Commission to trigger the mechanism on its own initiative. This proposal for the revision of the suspension mechanism includes the following elements: The definition of the circumstances which Member States can notify to the Commission has been amended to clarify that the suspension mechanism cannot only be used in ""emergency situations, as a last resort"", but more generally in case the visa liberalisation leads to a serious increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications. The reference period for comparing this situation with the situation of the previous year or before visa liberalisation, is shortened from six to two months. It is sufficient for the increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications to be ""substantial"", whereas the increase must currently be ""sudden and substantial"". The grounds for possible suspension which can be notified should include rejected readmission applications for nationals of another third country having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the Union or a Member State and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation. Other salient issues : - the limitation in time (to seven years) of the possibility to compare the current situation with the situation before visa liberalisation is abolished; - the Commission is given the possibility to trigger the suspension mechanism on its own initiative if it has concrete and reliable information of any of the circumstances which Member States can notify or that the third country is ‚Äì in a more general manner ‚Äì not cooperating on readmission, in particular where an EU-level readmission agreement has been concluded with that third country. This failure to cooperate can, for instance, consist in: (i) rejecting or not replying to readmission applications, (ii) failing to issue travel documents for the purposes of return within deadlines specified in the agreement or not accepting European travel documents issued following the lapse of deadlines specified in the agreement, (iii) terminating or suspending the agreement. ‚Äì Where the Commission, after having examined the circumstances notified (or of which it has received concrete and reliable information), decides that action is needed, the deadline for the adoption of the implementing act temporarily suspending the visa exemption for the third country concerned is reduced from three to one month. Territorial provisions : the proposed Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation, nor shall it be bound or subject to its application. The amended Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Dominica and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 11 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andDominica on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Dominica when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Dominica to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Dominica may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Dominica remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Dominica reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Dominica to stay only in those Member States‚Äô European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 11 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Saint Lucia on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Saint Lucia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Saint Lucia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Saint Lucia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Saint Lucia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Saint Lucia reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Saint Lucia to stay only in those Member States‚Äô European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directive 2008/95/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an increasingly competitive environment, the growing number of trade mark applications at both national and EU levels, and the growing number of trade mark users demonstrates the crucial role of trade marks in terms of market success and commercial value. This development has been accompanied by growing expectations on the part of stakeholders for more streamlined and high-quality trade mark registration systems, which are more consistent, publicly accessible and technologically up-to-date. In its ‚Äò Small Business Act ‚Äô of 2008, the Commission pledged to make the Community trademark system more accessible to SMEs. Furthermore, in its 2008 Communication on an Industrial Property Rights Strategy for Europe the Commission underlined its commitment to effective and efficient trademark protection and to a trademark system of high quality. It concluded that it was time for an overall evaluation, which could form the basis for a future review of the trademark system in Europe and for the further improvement of cooperation between the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM) and National Offices. Lastly, in its 2011 Intellectual Property Rights Strategy for Europe, the Commission announced a review of the trade mark system in Europe with a view to modernising the system, both at EU and at national level, by making it more effective, efficient and consistent overall. The Council has also called on the Commission to present proposals for the revision of Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 and Directive 2008/95/EC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment carried out for both the review of the Regulation and of the Directive identified two main problems: (i) the divergent provisions of the existing regulatory framework, and (ii) the low level of cooperation between trade mark offices in the Union. Four options were envisaged. ¬∑  Option 1 : no further approximation of trade mark laws and procedures; ¬∑  Option 2 : Partial expansion of the approximation of national laws and their consistency with the Community trade mark system; ¬∑  Option 3 : full approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures; ¬∑  Option 4 : a single trademark rulebook, which would replace Member States' trade mark laws in their entirety, by setting uniform rules across the Union. The impact assessment concluded that option 2 would be proportionate and would best serve to achieve the objectives pursued. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 (1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). CONTENT: the main common objective of this proposal for recasting and of the parallel proposal for the amendment of the Regulation is to foster innovation and economic growth by making trade mark registration systems all over the EU more accessible and efficient for businesses in terms of lower costs and complexity, increased speed, greater predictability and legal security. Specifically, the initiative to recast the Directive is driven by the following objectives: 1) Modernising and improving the existing provisions of the Directive. This will be achieved by amending outdated provisions, increasing legal certainty and clarifying trade mark rights in terms of their scope and limitations: ¬∑  the proposed new definition does not restrict the permissible means of representation to graphic or visual representation but leaves the door open to register matter that can be represented by technological means offering satisfactory guarantees; ¬∑  the proposal makes it clear that infringement claims are without prejudice to earlier rights; ¬∑  it is clarified that in cases of both double identity and similarity, it is only the origin function which matters; ¬∑  in accordance with the rulings of the Court of Justice, it is appropriate to treat trade name use of a protected trade mark as an infringing act, if the requirements of use for goods or services are met; ¬∑  the trade mark owner may prevent the use of his trade mark in comparative advertising where such comparative advertising does not satisfy the requirements of Directive 2006/114/EC; ¬∑  it is made clear that the importing of goods into the Union is also prohibited where it is only the consignor who acts for commercial purposes; ¬∑  bearing in mind the outcome of the Philips/Nokia judgment, the proposal entitles right holders to stop third parties from bringing goods, from third countries, bearing an unauthorised trade mark which is essentially identical to the trade mark registered in respect of those goods, into the customs territory of the Union, regardless of whether they are released for free circulation; ¬∑  there are provisions allowing proceedings against the distribution and sale of labels and packaging and similar items which may subsequently be combined with illicit products. 2) Achieve greater approximation of national trade mark laws and procedures with the aim of making them more consistent with the Community trade mark system, by (a) adding further substantive rules and (b) introducing principal procedural rules into the Directive in accordance with provisions contained in the Regulation. In this regard, it is proposed, inter alia: ¬∑  to insert provisions relating to geographical indications, traditional terms for wine and traditional specialities guaranteed in the Directive; ¬∑  to ensure that, in all Member States, national trade marks with reputation enjoy the same level of protection as that afforded to Community trade marks; ¬∑  to complement the Directive with a corresponding body of rules addressing trade marks as objects of property as contained in the Regulation; ¬∑  to provide for a set of specific provisions for the registration and protection of collective marks. 3) Facilitate cooperation between the offices of the Member States and OHIM for the purpose of promoting convergence of practices and the development of common tools, by putting in place a legal basis for this cooperation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries to which the European Union is a Contracting Party aims to ensure the long term conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North East Atlantic area, providing sustainable, environmental and social benefits. For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission (NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 transposes into Union law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC. At its Annual Meetings in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, NEAFC adopted: Recommendation 15:2013 amending the Scheme, concerning the communication of transhipments and of port of landing; Recommendation 9:2014 amending the Scheme, concerning, respectively, the definitions, a number of provisions applying to Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels and the infringement procedures; Recommendation 12:2015 amending Recommendation 9:2014 with respect to Articles 22 and 23 of the Scheme on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels. These Recommendations were adopted with the full support of the EU in NEAFC. It is in the EU's interest therefore that they be introduced in Union law by means of the proposed regulation. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 in order to incorporate it into Union law amendments to the Scheme as adopted in NEAFC Recommendations 15/2013 and 9/2014 as amended by Recommendation 12/2015 which have become binding for the Contracting Parties to NEAFC and consequently for the EU. The main change, operated by Recommendation 9/2014, is the alignment of the Scheme with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU, approved by the EU in 2011. Contracting Parties have agreed that this recommendation will enter into force on 1 July 2015. The other change, made through Recommendation 15/2013, clarifies that vessels involved in a transhipment operation in the Regulatory Area as receiving vessel shall communicate the port of landing regardless of whether the landing is to take place in a port inside or outside the Convention Area. Recommendation 12/2015 amended Recommendation 9/2014 with respect to notification procedures on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels with the aim to adapt them for the switch-over from a paper based system to a modern web-based ICT application, operated by the NEAFC Secretary."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. CONTENT: the EU's policy towards the countries of the Western Balkans is defined within the Stabilisation and Association Process launched in May 1999. At its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council concluded that Stabilisation and Association Agreements with Western Balkan countries should be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introduced exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the Stabilisation and Association process. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 applies until 31 December 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina: since the launch of the Stabilisation and Association Process, Stabilisation and Association Agreements have been concluded between the Union and all concerned Western Balkan countries, with the exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a potential candidate country for EU accession in 2003 and signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement in 2008, agreeing to the EU‚Äôs conditions for membership. Since then, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters with Bosnia and Herzegovina applies, pending the finalisation of the ratification process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Having regard to differences in the scope of the tariff liberalisation under the contractual regimes which have been developed between the Union and all participants to the Stabilisation and Association process and the preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, it is suggested to prolong the duration of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2020, so as to give the beneficiaries of the exceptional trade measures and the European Union sufficient time to align, where appropriate, preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 with those provided for under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Consequences of the enlargement of the EU to Croatia: Bosnia and Herzegovina have not yet accepted to adapt trade concessions granted under the Interim Agreement in order to take into account the preferential traditional trade between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). In case Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union do not find an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions, preferences granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 should be suspended as of 1 January 2016. Once Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union have signed and applied provisionally an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions in the Interim Agreement, these preferences will be reestablished. Human Rights : Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 does not provide any possibility to temporarily suspend the grant of exceptional trade measures in case of serious and systematic violations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by its beneficiaries. It is appropriate to introduce such possibility, so as to ensure that swift action can be taken in case serious and systematic violations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law would occur in one of the countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process. Wine originating in Montenegro : lastly, a technical adjustment regarding Montenegro's access to the additional global quota for wine imports is included."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (the ITS Directive) requires that specifications be adopted, through delegated acts, for actions in four priority areas. Since the entry into force of Directive 2010/40/EU, four delegated acts relating to priority actions of that Directive have been adopted by the Commission. They address in particular eCall and data sharing mechanisms facilitating the electronic data exchange between the relevant public authorities and stakeholders and the relevant ITS service providers. There is a need for further delegated acts regarding actions still to be addressed and belonging to the scope of Directive 2010/40/EU. Not extending the delegation of power to the Commission would endanger the EU-wide integrated and coordinated deployment of interoperable ITS in road transport and their interfaces with other transport modes. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to extend the delegation of power for an additional period of five years starting from 27 August 2017. This period should be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council oppose such an extension."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : the Commission proposal covers targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) 2016/1036 on protection against dumped imports from countries that are not members of the European Union (the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation) and to Regulation (EU) 2016/1037 on protection against subsidised imports from countries that are not members of the European Union (the Basic Anti-Subsidy Regulation). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account the results of the public consultation, the independent study and the Commission's extensive practice in the use of the instruments, an impact assessment was carried out in Spring 2016, when various options were analysed. The preferred solutions form the basis for this proposal. CONTENT : the proposal provides as follows: 1) Amendments to the Basic Anti-Dumping Regulation: Determination of normal value in the presence of market distortions : the Regulation stipulates the basis on which normal value should be determined in the case of imports from non-market economy countries. In view of developments with respect to certain countries that are Members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is proposed to amend the method used to calculate the normal value and the dumping margin for the countries concerned. For WTO members, the normal value is normally determined on the basis of the domestic prices of the like product or on the basis of a constructed normal value. There are circumstances, however, in which the domestic prices and costs would not provide a reasonable basis to determine the normal value. This could be the case, for instance, when prices or costs are not the result of free market forces because they are affected by government intervention. In such circumstances, the Commission considers that it would be inappropriate to use domestic prices and costs to determine the value at which the like product should be normally sold. Accordingly, a new provision stipulates that the normal value would instead be constructed on the basis of costs of production and sale reflecting undistorted prices or benchmarks. For this purpose, the sources that may be used would include undistorted international prices, costs, or benchmarks, or corresponding costs of production and sale in an appropriate representative country with a similar level of economic development as the exporting country. This methodology would allow the Commission to establish and measure the actual magnitude of dumping being practised in normal market conditions absent distortions. For the sake of transparency and efficiency, the Commission services intend to issue public reports describing the specific situation concerning the market circumstances in any given country or sector. Such reports and the evidence on which it is based would also be placed on the file of any investigation relating to that country or sector so that all interested parties would be in a position to express their views and comments. Transition from the current system to the new one : the proposal introduces specific disciplines ensuring that the entry into force of the new system would not create legal uncertainty for ongoing cases or unduly affect existing measures. Thus, the proposal makes clear that the new system would only apply to cases initiated upon entry into force of the amended provisions. Any given ongoing anti-dumping investigation at the time of entry into force would remain governed by the current disciplines. 2) Amendment to the Basic Anti-Subsidy Regulation : experience shows that the actual magnitude of subsidisation is not always evident at the time of initiation. Yet, those subsidies clearly provide an unfair benefit the exporters concerned, which allow them to sell at injurious prices to the EU market. For reasons of due process and transparency, the proposal clarifies that, when such subsidies are found in the course of any given investigation or review, the Commission will offer additional consultations to the country of origin and/or export concerned with regard to such subsidies identified in the course of the investigation. In these situations, the Commission will send to the country of origin and/or export a summary of the main elements concerning these other subsidies to ensure meaningful consultations."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the effective return of third country nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member State of the Union is an essential part of a comprehensive approach to ensure the proper functioning of the EU migration policies and for maintaining public trust in the Union migration system. However, the EU system to return irregular migrants is not sufficiently effective. The lack of valid travel documents issued by the country of destination of the returnee is one of the main obstacles to successful return. At present, Member States may issue a substitute document for those illegally staying third-country nationals who do not possess a valid travel document. However, its recognition by third countries is low, including because of its unsatisfactory security features and standards. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish a dedicated European travel document for the return of third-country nationals subject to a return decision. It aims to: harmonise the format and technical specifications of the European travel document for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals in order to ensure higher technical and security standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification; facilitate recognition of this document by third countries for the purpose of return and readmission; increase flexibility for the authorities of third countries in terms of managing documents in order for them to accelerate the administrative procedures for return and reduce the administrative burden on competent consular authorities; set the rules relating to the fees for issuing the European travel document for return, which shall be free of charge for the third-country national given that it shall only be valid for a single journey; contribute to reducing the period during which returnees awaiting removal are kept in administrative detention."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: Article 19 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 stipulates that in the event of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or programmes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum and Migration Fund and the Internal Security Fund, the MFF shall be revised in order to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014. The revision concerning the transfer of unused allocation for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May 2015. It thus applies to programmes adopted after 1 January 2014 even when the relevant legal act was adopted by that time. Moreover, ‚Äòrules‚Äô covers not only the basic legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds concerned, but also implementing and delegated acts, to the extent to which they are a prerequisite for preparing or finalising the programmes. Consequently, this provision also applies to funds from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative as the legal basis is the same as for programmes. It also applies to the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) as its commitments originate from the Structural Funds and are implemented under shared management. Article 19 also covers contributions from the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance as those amounts are part of national allocations defined in Article 91(2) of the ESI Funds‚Äô Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). It should be noted that Article 19 does not impose any constraints as to the profile of the transfer of allocations to subsequent years. Amounts concerned: as a result of such late adoption: This proposal seeks to amend Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring the commitment appropriations not used in 2014 to subsequent years for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3. N.B. the Commission proposes to transfer the bulk of the allocations not used in 2014 to year 2015 in order to keep the pace of investments for growth and jobs, minimise differences of treatment with programmes adopted in 2014 and ensure equal treatment with programmes whose 2014 commitment tranche is carried-over in accordance with Article 13 of the Financial Regulation. An annex sets outs details of the amounts transferred by the Funds concerned and by year of transfer. IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENTS: concerning the implications on payments in 2015, they will be covered within the voted budget for 2015. The first initial pre-financing that has not been paid in 2014 will have to be paid in 2015 together with the second pre-financing. However, the corresponding unused appropriations in 2014 have been used by transfers to reduce the backlog of unpaid bills from the previous period 2007-2013 and the reverse operation could be done, if need be, in 2015 to cover the pre-financings. The medium and longer term implications on interim payments of the transfer are more difficult to predict. The legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds contain provisions for the automatic decommitment of appropriations not used within a given deadline, which is of n+3 years for the ESI Funds and of n+2 years for the AMIF and the ISF. This could in principle result in a shift of payments from one year to another without this lowering the overall needs over the 2014-2020 period. On the other hand, the real pace of implementation will not be pre-determined by the transfer. For these reasons, the Commission does not propose to revise the payment ceilings. It will review the situation regularly in the light of implementation and make proposals if appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MFF Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the single European framework for the transparency of skills and qualifications (Europass) was established by Decision No. 2241/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Europass consisted of a set of documents comprising a Europass portfolio: the Europass Curriculum Vitae (CV) template allows individuals to complete their CV in a standardised format. Over ten years there have been more than 60 million Europass CVs created online; two qualification supplement templates, namely (i) the Europass Diploma Supplement and (ii) the Europass Certificate Supplement , offer information on the content and learning outcomes associated with a qualification and on the education system of the country issuing the qualification; the Europass Language Passport is used to describe language skills; the Europass Mobility describes the skills acquired abroad on mobility experiences for learning or work. The evaluation of the Europass framework (in 2008 and in 2013) confirmed that Europass documents have the potential to facilitate mobility and that they are useful tools for individuals who are interested in working or studying abroad. Europass has also played an important role in mobility within the same country (40% of surveyed users were domestically mobile) and indeed the documents have become widely used within some countries such as Italy and Spain. However, the way EU tools and services have evolved over time has not necessarily followed the changes in the way people learn, work or communicate today and they are not responding to current or future demands and emerging technologies. Digitalisation and enhanced online presence are the minimum expected of tools for skills and qualifications today and even more so in the future. Accordingly, the Commission considers it necessary to establish a new framework, which encompasses more responsive tools and information, both for learning and employment purposes, including skills intelligence, and which ensures better synergies with other relevant services such as the EURES (European Employment Services) network. The proposed decision is one of the initiatives of the New Skills Agenda for Europe. CONTENT: the proposal to revise Decision 2241/2004/EC aims to update and enhance the Europass framework to bring it more in line with today's need for more comprehensive, updated, easy-to-use and interoperable information and allow it to accommodate future developments and needs. Improved service offered by the new Europass framework : Europass will be comprised of the following web tools: the CV tool would allow for presentation of different kinds of personal data and information on skills and qualifications in a variety of fields and formats : the CV will become more adaptable to different needs and situations that arise for learners and jobseekers in different stages of their professional and personal lives. It can be edited and printed easily, but users will also be able to present their skills and qualifications in other less traditional formats, including visuals. They will also be able to make better use of the advantages of social media, mobile applications and job matching tools; tools to (self-)assess individual skills , such as digits skills, through questionnaires, or by reference to established descriptions of skills or through the integration of data from other existing EU self-assessment tools such as the Youthpass. Along with tools for documentation and (self-) assessment, the proposed framework will also provide relevant information on (i) qualifications, (ii) learning opportunities, (iii) career guidance facilities, (iv) qualifications recognition practices and skills intelligence, (v) analysis of trends in skills supply and demand and other types of skills intelligence including at geographical and sectoral level, using technological means such as big data analysis and web crawling. Users will access this information in a simple and seamless way. The revised Europass framework will offer the possibility to develop and use open standards for better exchange and sharing of electronic data on skills and qualifications and allow interoperability of services. Main principles inspiring the new framework : the proposal aims to ensure transparency of learning and skills acquired in different settings (formal, non-formal and informal). The revised Europass framework will take into account the levels of qualifications as set out in the European Qualifications Framework. Europass will be offered in all EU official languages. Classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations (ESCO) : the proposal establishes this as a common reference language to support exchange of information and documents on occupations, skills and qualifications and search electronic documents. Using a common terminology will make search operations easier and support better exploitation of current technology such as web crawling. Roles of Member States : the proposal sets out the main roles of Member States, in particular in relation to the designation and management of the National Skills Coordination Point responsible for co-ordination of activities associated with implementing the Europass Decision and linked tasks related to the EQF, validation, skills intelligence and guidance. The mandate and tasks of the National Skills Coordination Points are set out. Relevant data and evidence available at national level are provided to feed into and update Europass tools. Measures provided for in the decision shall be carried out in accordance with EU law on protection of personal data. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: most of the tools covered by the proposed decision already exist and are financed by the Union. The financial implications of the initiative are mainly linked to IT development, hosting and maintenance costs of web-based services at EU level. Developing a more comprehensive online service will be financed by the Union. Some initial investment will be needed in the short-term for new IT development of the new European-wide web-based platform, but there should be no unexpected costs at EU level. The Erasmus+ Work programme for 2016 includes activities to develop web services for skills and qualifications for an estimated amount of EUR 2 500 000 to cover this investment. There will be no financial implications for Member States, or participating countries, from this development work. This activity will be supported by Union budget, as is currently the case."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EUYO is a unique orchestra in Europe, founded following a 1976 European Parliament resolution. Its Honorary President is the President of the European Parliament and its honorary patrons are the Heads of State or Government of the Member States, headed by the President of the European Commission. Composed of very talented young musicians from all over Europe in a world-class European orchestra, it plays a unique role in promoting intercultural dialogue and mutual respect and understanding through culture. It also contributes to the circulation of European works and the mobility of young European talent beyond national and European borders. The Creative Europe programme and its previous funding programs have supported the EUYO in various ways. Without sustained EU-wide support, it could not continue its activities and the Union would lose an important cultural ambassador. The EUYO should therefore be included among the measures benefitting from support from the Culture Sub-programme of the Creative Europe programme.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only with Parliament‚Äôs approval. BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union. Consequently, it was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. Negotiations with Brazil resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 12 July 2016 in Geneva.

5898,5064,118.0,1.0,15.03.2017,Use of the 470-790 MHz frequency band in the Union,***I,Leg,Draft legislative resolution,s,Tola,A8-0327/2016,2016/0027/COD,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A8-2016-0327&language=EN,"Committee on Industry, Research and Energy","Industry, research & energy",Provisional agreement ,0.0,34,committee,RCV,+,614,44,28,60.0,11.0,197.0,44.0,10.0,52.0,166.0,39.0,0.857,0.229,0.891,0.88,0.192,0.776,0.869,0.75,1,0,0,0,https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2016/0027(COD),https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/summary.do?id=1421833&t=e&l=en,"PURPOSE: to ensure coordinated transition in spectrum use of the 470-790 MHz frequency band in the Union according to common objectives. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: rapidly growing wireless broadband traffic makes enhanced wireless network capacity a necessity. Wireless connectivity requires access to spectrum in the bands below 1 GHz, being the sweet spot for both wide coverage and high speeds. In its strategy for the digital single market (DSM), the Commission highlights the importance of the 694-790 MHz (‚Äò700 MHz‚Äô) frequency band for ensuring the provision of broadband services in rural areas and stresses the need for a coordinated release of that frequency band, while accommodating the specific needs of audiovisual media services distribution. At present the UHF broadcasting band comprises the range of frequencies from 470 to 790 MHz (the ‚ÄòUHF band‚Äô). This band is used for digital terrestrial television (DTT) and audio programme making and special events (‚Äòaudio PMSE‚Äô) equipment, essentially wireless microphones. The 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12), the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) Conference that revises the binding Radio Regulations, decided that the 700 MHz band should be allocated to both the broadcasting and mobile service in Region 1 (Europe and Africa) as of 2015. The absence of a Union-wide common legislation for the UHF band would create detrimental fragmentation in the use of the UHF band within the Union. The Commission responded to the outcomes of the European stakeholder process and international agreements under the aegis of the ITU by developing a strategy for the Union on the long-term use of the UHF band. The strategy will promote the digital single market and ensure efficient management of radio spectrum in the UHF band, reflecting its social, cultural and economic value. The UHF band strategy has three major strands: harmonised technical conditions for wireless broadband electronic communications services in the 700 MHz frequency band based on the principle of technology and service neutrality; a common deadline for making the 700 MHz band available for effective use for wireless broadband electronic communications services in line with the harmonised technical conditions above, and coordination measures to support this transition; priority for distribution of audiovisual media services (AVMS) in the sub-700 MHz frequency band in conjunction with a flexible approach to how the band is used; this is necessary to cater for diversity regarding the market significance of DTT in Member States. This proposal contributes to the target of 1200 MHz for wireless broadband, which is one of the key objectives of Decision 2012/243/EU of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a multiannual radio spectrum policy programme (RSPP). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option chosen by the Commission seeks to reach the following strategic objectives: (i) coordinated designation and authorisation of the 700 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband by 2020; (ii) coordinated designation of the sub-700 MHz frequency band for flexible use, subject to national demand, which would safeguard the continued provision of audiovisual media services to a mass audience (in a technology-neutral way), including free-to-view distribution, as well as spectrum availability for audio PMSE use. CONTENT: in accordance with the UHF band strategy, this proposal lays down two binding common deadlines for Member States for repurposing the 700 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband: cross-border coordination agreements must be completed by the end of 2017; the 700 MHz frequency band must be made available for effective use for wireless broadband electronic communications services by mid-2020. In addition, the proposal also: requires Member States to consult on at national level and consider taking measures to ensure a high-quality level of coverage of their population and territory when they grant rights of use of the 700 MHz band for wireless broadband electronic communications services; deals with the long-term use of the sub-700 MHz frequency band. It requires Member States to safeguard use of this band in the long term for the distribution of audiovisual media services to a mass audience (or to the general public). This should include continued use for wireless audio PMSE, in accordance with national priorities; requires Member States to adopt and communicate across the Union their national roadmaps on repurposing the 700 MHz frequency band for wireless broadband and the related transition process for the whole UHF band; requires the Commission to conduct by 2025 a review of spectrum use in the sub700 MHz frequency band in cooperation with the Member States and report its conclusions together with any proposal for regulatory changes, which might, for example, change the substance or format of safeguards or their duration."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of negotiating directives adopted by the Council, the Commission has negotiated the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with a view to establishing a state of the art and privileged economic relationship with Canada. Canada is a strategic partner of the European Union and they have reached an ambitious agreement which will open up new opportunities for trade and investment for economic actors on both sides of the Atlantic. Both sides have also underlined through this agreement the importance of economic activity taking place within a framework of clear and transparent regulation defined by public authorities, and that they consider the right to regulate in the public interest as a basic underlying principle of the Agreement. The CETA negotiations were completed and initialled at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 1 August 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this comprehensive agreement on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt a Decision to conclude the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part. Aim of the Agreement: the CETA is a comprehensive trade and investment agreement which contains provisions on: Specific trade aim: CETA will significantly improve business opportunities for European companies in Canada. With CETA, European companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thus levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for EU companies. By opening markets, CETA should support growth and jobs in the EU and bring further benefits for European consumers. It has the potential to keep prices down and provide consumers with greater choice of quality products. CETA will not change EU standards. Standards and regulations related to food safety, product safety, consumer protection, health, environment, social or labour standards etc. will remain untouched. All imports from Canada will have to satisfy all EU product rules and regulations ‚Äì without exception. Institutional component of the Agreement: the Agreement establishes a CETA Joint Committee that will continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of this agreement. The CETA Joint Committee is comprised of representatives of the European Union and representatives of Canada who will meet once a year or at the request of a Party and will supervise the work of all specialised committees and other bodies established under this Agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the CETA will be the first to incorporate the new Investment Court System (ICS) in the context of the Investment Dispute Resolution System. Accordingly, an amount of EUR 500 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2017 onwards (subject to ratification) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal. It is estimated that foregone duty will reach an amount of EUR 311 million upon full implementation of the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 8 December 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Canada, of the other part. The negotiations on the Agreement commenced in September 2011 and concluded in September 2014 with initialling of the Agreement. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Agreement on 28 October 2016, the Agreement was signed on 30 October 2016 at the 16th EU-Canada Summit. The present joint proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement. Note on legal basis: Article 218(6)(a)(iii) TFEU states that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council shall adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU states that the Council shall act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy and technical cooperation with developed countries. These aspects of the Agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for adopting a Union act. The Agreement establishes an institutional framework for cooperation between the EU and Canada. The legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 TEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The aim of the Agreement is to strengthen existing cooperation between the Parties, which is based on the 1976 Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, in order to cover political dialogue and common foreign and security policy-related issues, and a broad range of sectors including environment, justice and security, migration and integration, fisheries, education, culture, human rights, northern development and indigenous issues, youth exchanges and transport security. The Agreement (SPA) envisages several kinds of cooperation: Political cooperation: the aim of the SPA is to strengthen EU - Canada political ties and cooperation on foreign and security issues, and to advance cooperation on a large number of policy areas besides trade and economics. The Agreement enshrines EU-Canada common democratic values and will advance cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral level. The SPA will strengthen political dialogue in fields such as: It reaffirms the Parties' commitment to safeguarding international peace and security by preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and undertaking measures to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Institutional cooperation: the SPA provides the mechanism for conducting political dialogue by organising annual summits at leaders level and consultations at ministerial level. It also establishes a Joint Ministerial Committee, which replaces the previous Transatlantic Dialogue, and a Joint Cooperation Committee with the objective of monitoring the development of the strategic relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement provides for the possibility of suspending its application in case of a violation of essential elements of the Agreement such as human rights and non-proliferation. In addition, the Parties recognise that a particularly serious and substantial violation of human rights or non-proliferation could also serve as grounds for the termination of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). The SPA, in conjunction with the CETA, is expected to provide tangible benefits and opportunities to the citizens of the EU and Canada."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the Decision of the Council of 14 May 2012, a Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part, was signed on 30 April 2013, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Agreement should now be approved on behalf of the European Union. The PCA will supersede the current legal framework of the 1993 Agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the European Economic Community and Mongolia. The Commission notes that following the 11 June 2014 ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-377/12 Commission v Council regarding the Council Decision on the signature of the PCA with the Philippines, this proposal should be based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, it is proposed that the Council approve, on behalf of the Union, the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part. Shared principles: the PCA is testimony to the growing importance of EU-Mongolia relations based on shared principles such as equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It includes the EU‚Äôs standard political clauses on human rights, weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), the International Criminal Court (ICC), small arms and light weapons (SALWs) and counter-terrorism, and promotes bilateral, regional and international cooperation. Concrete cooperation: the PCA will allow the EU to assume greater responsibility and influence in the region, and to promote European values and provide the basis for more effective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Mongolia. It strengthens political, economic and sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, including trade and investment, development, justice, freedom and security. It encompasses areas such as: Institutional framework: the draft Agreement comprises institutional measures establishing a Joint Committee, composed of representatives of both sides at an appropriate high level, whose tasks shall be to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of this Agreement. Duration of the Agreement: this Agreement is valid for a period of five years. It shall be automatically extended for further successive periods of one year, unless either Party notifies the other in writing of its intention not to do so."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the 1979 World Trade Organisation (WTO) plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft was adopted as part of the Tokyo Round. It entered into force on 1 January 1980 and it now has 32 signatories. This Agreement eliminates import duties on all aircraft, other than military aircraft, as well as on all other products covered by the agreement, in particular civil aircraft engines and their parts and components, all components and sub-assemblies of civil aircraft, and flight simulators and their parts and components. It contains disciplines on government-directed procurement of civil aircraft and prohibition of inducements to purchase, as well as on government financial support for the civil aircraft sector. The Annex to the Agreement lists the products that shall be accorded duty-free or duty-exempt treatment, if such products are for the use in civil aircraft or ground flying trainers and for incorporation therein, in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance rebuilding, modification or conversion. Products in the Annex of the Agreement are classified according to their respective tariff headings for customs purposes under the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) developed by the World Customs Organization. Since the adoption of the ATCA, different versions of Harmonized System have been adopted. In November 2001, members adopted a Protocol Amending the Annex to the ATCA, transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the 1992, 1996 and 2002 versions of the Harmonised System. Another revision of the Harmonized System took place in 2007. On 5 November 2015, after several years of discussions, the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft agreed to open for acceptance the revised Product Coverage of the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft via the Protocol amending the annex to the ATCA. CONTENT: the Commission is presenting the Commission is submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the Protocol amending the Product Coverage Annex of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. The protocol covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy and the amendment concerns a technical update of an international agreement without altering its scope or content. The new Protocol open for acceptance on 5th November 2015 by the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft will modify the 2001 Protocol to make it compatible with the 2007 version of the Harmonized System."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to respond to increased migratory and security challenges, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a new integrated border management fund under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. This new fund aims to provide enhanced support to Member States with a view to securing the Union‚Äôs common external borders. Within this framework, it is proposed that the integrated border management fund shall consist of two instruments: a financial support instrument in the field of border and visa management and a financial support instrument for customs control equipment. This proposal only concerns customs control equipment. The Commission shall at the same time present a separate proposal on the instrument in the field of border management and visas. The 2 140 customs offices that are present over the external borders of the European Union need to be properly equipped to ensure the operation of the customs union. In order to avoid the diversion of flows of goods towards the weakest points, it is essential to ensure equivalence in the performance of customs controls throughout the Customs Union. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to create the financial support instrument for customs control equipment as part of integrated border management fund. It lays down the objectives of the Instrument, the budget for the period 2021 ‚Äì 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Objective : the proposed instrument aims to ensure greater uniformity in the performance of customs controls at the external borders by addressing the current imbalances between Member States due to geographical differences and disparities in capacity and available resources. It shall complement the actions foreseen under the Customs programme. The specific objective of this instrument is to contribute to adequate and equivalent customs control through the purchase, maintenance and upgrade of customs control equipment. The instrument shall be implemented in direct management, by means of grants. The Commission shall set up a coordination mechanism ensuring efficiency and interoperability between all the equipment purchased with the support of Union programmes and instruments. Eligible equipment : equipment shall be eligible only if it relates to at least one of the six following purposes: (i) non-intrusive inspection; (ii) indication of hidden objects on humans; (iii) radiation detection and nuclide identification; (iv) analysis of samples in laboratories; (v) sampling and field analysis of samples; (vi) handheld search. Annex 1 lays down an indicative list of customs control equipment that may be used to achieve the customs control purposes. The Commission may amend this list by means of delegated acts. In addition to the purchase, maintenance and upgrade of eligible equipment, and where appropriate, the instrument will also support the purchase or upgrade of customs control equipment for testing new pieces or new functionalities in operational conditions. Proposed budget : the Commission‚Äôs proposal for the next multi-annual framework includes a proposal of EUR 9.31 billion (in current prices) for the integrated border management fund for the period 2021-2027. Within this global envelope, the financial resources available for the implementation of this specific Regulation amount to EUR 1.3 billion (in current prices)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with a Council Decision, the status agreement between the EU and Albania on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in the Republic of Albania, was signed, subject to its conclusion. Pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2016/1624, in cases where it is envisaged that European Border and Coast Guard teams will be deployed to a third country in actions where the team members will have executive powers, or where other actions in third countries require it, a status agreement shall be concluded by the Union with the third country concerned. Thanks to this status agreement, border guard teams can be swiftly deployed on Albanian territory and respond to the current shift in migratory flows towards the coastal route and assist in external border management and fight against migrant smuggling. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the status agreement between the EU and Albania on actions carried out by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency in Albania. The main provisions of the proposal are as follows: Operational plan: before each joint operation or rapid border intervention, an operational plan must be agreed between the Agency and Albania. That operational plan must also be agreed by the Member State or Member States bordering the operational area. It shall set out in detail the organisational and procedural aspects of the joint operation or rapid border intervention, including, inter alia, a description and an assessment of the situation, the operational aim and objectives, the provisions in respect of fundamental rights including personal data protection, the organisational arrangements and logistics, the evaluation and the financial aspects of the joint operation or rapid border intervention. Tasks and powers of the members of the team: as a general rule, the teams shall have the authority to perform the tasks and exercise the executive powers required for border control and return operations. They shall respect the laws and regulations of Albania. Members of the team shall wear their own uniform, visible personal identification and a blue armband with the insignias of the European Union and of the Agency on their uniforms. Members of the team may use force, including service weapons, ammunition and equipment, with the consent of their own State and of the Albania authorities, in the presence of Albanian border guards or other relevant staff, and in accordance with the Albanian law. Albanian authorities may authorise members of the team to use force also in the absence of their border guards. Accreditation document: the Agency shall, in cooperation with Albania, issue an accreditation document to members of the team for the purposes of identification vis-√†-vis the Albanian authorities as proof of the holder‚Äôs rights to perform the tasks and exercise the powers conferred under this Agreement and in the Operational Plan. Fundamental rights: in the performance of their tasks and in the exercise of their powers, Members of the team shall fully respect fundamental rights and freedoms, including as regards access to asylum procedures, human dignity and the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to liberty, the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of collective expulsions, the rights of the child and the right to respect for private and family life. They shall not arbitrarily discriminate against persons on any grounds including sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age, sexual orientation or gender identity. Each Party must have a complaint mechanism in place to deal with allegations of a breach of fundamental rights committed by its staff. Processing of personal data: personal data shall be processed by members of the team when necessary in accordance with the rules applicable to the Agency and the EU Member States. Processing of personal data by the Albanian authorities shall be subject to Albanian laws. The Agency, the participating Member States and the Albanian authorities shall draw up a common report on the processing of personal data by members of the team at the end of each action. This report shall be sent to the Agency's Fundamental Rights Officer and Data Protection Officer. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: although the status agreement in itself does not entail financial implications, it is the actual deployment of border guards' teams on the basis of an operational plan and relevant grant agreement that will entail costs borne by the budget of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Future operations under the status agreement will be financed through the European Border and Coast Guard Agency‚Äôs own resources. The financial statement annexed to the proposal for a Regulation on a European Border and Coast Guard on the expenditure of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency evaluated at EUR 6.090 million on average each year for 2017-2020 the reinforced cooperation with third countries (including possible joint operations with neighbouring countries)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the majority of the EU trade agreements include a bilateral safeguard clause. This clause provides for the possibility to suspend the further tariff liberalization or to re-instate the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) customs duty rate when, as a result of trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the domestic producers producing the like or directly competitive product. In addition, some EU trade agreements may include special mechanisms which also confer the possibility to reintroduce the MFN customs duty rate. It is necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the safeguard clauses that will have been agreed with the countries concerned. The Agreements may also include other mechanisms for temporary withdrawal of tariff or of other preferential treatment. It is also necessary to lay down the procedures for the application of such mechanisms, where included in the Agreements. So far, it has been a consistent practice that the Commission proposed an implementing regulation in conjunction with each separate recent trade agreement. Based on past experience and existing regulations, it is suggested that the whole process could be streamlined by proposing a horizontal bilateral safeguard regulation which could be used for all future FTAs CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation lays down provisions for the implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses and other mechanisms on the temporary withdrawal of tariff preferences or other preferential treatment contained in the Agreements concluded between the Union and a third country referred to in the Annex to the Regulation. The proposed Regulation would specify the procedural details and technical aspects common to any bilateral safeguard instrument (initiation and conduct of investigations, procedures for the provisional adoption and definitive measures, duration and review of safeguard measures, adoption of prior surveillance measures on imports from a country concerned, etc.). A separate chapter would set the procedural rules concerning special mechanisms. An Annex would reflect the applicability of the regulation for a specific FTA partner in question as well as any specificities of the trade agreement in question. The Regulation for the moment foresees the implementation of the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), the EU-Vietnam FTA and the EU-Japan FTA. It is also proposed that future trade agreements would be added to the scope of the regulation by delegated acts."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides, inter alia, that authorisation schemes and certain types of requirements related to services must be non-discriminatory with regard to nationality or residence, justified by an overriding reason related to the public interest. To make sure that new measures imposed by Member States actually fulfil these conditions and thus facilitate the competitiveness and integration of the single market in services, the Services Directive provides that Member States shall notify to the Commission new or changed authorisation schemes or certain new or changed requirements falling under the Directive. Commission assessments have shown, however, that the current notification procedure under the Services Directive does not always achieve its objective. The Commission therefore presents a self-standing legislative instrument modernising the current notification procedure under the Services Directive in order to improve the enforcement of the existing provisions of that Directive. This proposal is included in the continuation of the Single Market Strategy. The European Council called for ambition in delivering the Single Market Strategy and for the different Single Market strategies to be completed and implemented by 2018. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice is a combination of options to use a legislative initiative to enable identified shortcomings to be addressed and establish an effective and efficient notification procedure with only a small increase in administrative costs for national public authorities and the Commission. CONTENT: the notification procedure established by the proposed Directive aims to ensure that certain national restrictions to the freedom of establishment and to the freedom to provide services will comply with the Services Directive, contributing to its better enforcement. Notification obligation : Member States shall notify to the Commission any draft measure that introduces new requirements or authorisation schemes, or modifies such existing requirements or authorisation schemes. The proposal also provides that Member States have to notify authorisation schemes, certain establishment requirements, certain requirements affecting the freedom to provide services and requirements concerning professional liability insurance and multidisciplinary activities. Consultation, alert and Decision : the proposal establishes a consultation period of three months following the notification of a draft measure. The Commission and other Member States have a maximum of two months to comment on a notified measure, followed by a maximum of one month for the notifying Member State to respond to such comments. The Commission may issue an alert to the notifying Member State where after assessing the notified measure it has concerns about its compliance with the Services Directive. The issuing of an alert implies that the Member State concerned shall not adopt the notified measure at issue for three months. After an alert has been issued, the Commission may adopt a legally binding Decision finding the notified measure to be incompatible with the Services Directive and requesting the notifying Member State to refrain from adopting it. Information to the public : the proposal provides for transparency to third parties of notified draft measures, accompanying information and the final adopted measures. In order to ensure an effective exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission, the Internal Market Information System set up by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 (IMI Regulation) of the European Parliament and of the Council should continue to be used under this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insolvency proceedings (recast) entered into force on 26 June 2015. It will apply from 26 June 2017, with the exception of the part relating to the system for interconnection of national insolvency registers, which will apply from 26 June 2019. Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in point (4) of Article 2 of the Regulation. Annex B lists the insolvency practitioners referred to in point (5) of Article 2. In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission on a substantial reform of its domestic law on restructuring, taking effect as of 1 January 2016, and requested to change the lists set out in Annexes A and B to the Regulation accordingly. After having carefully analysed the request of Poland in order to ensure compliance of the notification with the requirements of the Regulation, the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation ((EU) 2015/848 accordingly. CONTENT: the Commission proposal seeks to replace the lists for Poland in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into account the information notified by that Member States. Since the Annexes are intrinsic part of the Regulation, their modification can only be achieved via the legislative amendment of the Regulation. This proposal aims at ensuring that the scope of the recast Regulation is adjusted to the actual legal framework of the Member States on insolvency by the time of its application. The envisaged amendments are of a purely technical nature. They contain no substantive change to the Regulation."

LEGAL BASIS: Article 207, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part, entered into force on 1 July 1999. This agreement contains a provision according to which its trade provisions ‚Äì namely, most favoured nation (MFN) trade conditions and abolition of quantitative restrictions ‚Äì do not apply to trade in textile products, which was regulated by a separate bilateral agreement. This bilateral agreement, in force since 1 January 2000, lapsed on 31 December 2004. While in practice trade in textiles between the EU and Uzbekistan continued to proceed smoothly since 1 January 2005, legal certainty needs to be ensured. On 9 June 2010, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations with the Republic of Uzbekistan to amend the PCA, so as to ensure that the principles which apply to trade in other goods are also extended formally to trade in textile products. These negotiations have been successfully concluded and the Protocol amending the PCA by abrogating Article 16 and all references thereto, was initialled on 1 July 2010. In addition, some updates of a technical nature have been introduced. This has taken the form of the deletion of Article 8(3) and Annex I, stemming from the time of the dissolution of the USSR, and which had expired in 1998. The Council is invited to adopt the attached proposed Decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the PCA, which shall form an integral part of the PCA. A separate proposal on the signature of the Protocol is also being submitted. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

BACKGROUND: on 19 January 2009, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a trade agreement on behalf of the Union with those Member Countries of the Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru) which shared the aim to reach a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement. On 26 June 2012, the EU signed a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Trade Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 March 2013 for Peru and 1 August 2013 for Colombia. On 17 July 2014, the Union and Ecuador concluded their negotiations on the Protocol to take account of the Accession of Ecuador to the Trade Agreement. The text of the Protocol was approved by the Trade Committee of the Trade Agreement at its meeting of 8 February 2016. CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Protocol of Accession to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Colombia and Peru on the other part, to take account of the Accession of Ecuador. The Protocol in question establishes the necessary modifications to the Trade Agreement to take account of the accession of Ecuador. The Trade Agreement establishes the conditions for EU economic operators to take full advantage of the opportunities and the emerging complementarities between our respective economies: According to the Commission, the accession of Ecuador to the existing Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru, which is a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement, reinforces the legal framework of the EU trade relations with this country and facilitates reciprocal trade and investment. Moreover, accession to the Trade Agreement will provide an anchor for Ecuador's economic reforms and efforts to integrate the global economy and increase welfare. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 80 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: an Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat between Denmark, Norway and Sweden was signed on 19 December 1966. It remained in force for an initial period of 35 years until 2002 and was subsequently extended for two five-year periods until 2012. This agreement allowed for reciprocal access between those three countries to fish up to 4 nautical miles from their respective baselines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, which are the waters between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It established that, for the purposes of such fishing, the area in question was deemed to constitute the high seas. In view of more recent developments in international fisheries law, Norway considered that the existing agreement was not in conformity with the current provisions of the Law of the Sea. Norway was particularly concerned with regard to the provisions on control. On 29 July 2009, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry formally informed the Danish authorities that they wished to terminate the Agreement with a formal denunciation. Consequently, the Agreement expired on 7 August 2012. Subsequently, Norway entered into formal negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim of establishing a replacement Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area. This new Agreement was signed on 15 January 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden on behalf of the Union. The new Agreement: The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT‚ÄôS ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 allows Member States to compensate 36 enumerated railway undertakings for the payment of obligations which undertakings of other transport modes do not have to support, such as special family allowances and pensions. When the rules for normalisation are correctly applied, such State support is considered compatible with the internal market and Member States are exempted from State aid notification obligations, Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 was adopted before the rail market was liberalised and when rail transport in Europe was developing primarily within national borders, with integrated companies both operating rail services and managing rail infrastructure. Today, this Regulation is inconsistent and incompatible with legislative measures currently in force, as well as with the fundamental principles laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area which include that: (i) railway undertakings shall be managed according to principles that apply to commercial companies; (ii) entities responsible for the allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure shall be separate from entities which operate rail services; (iii) there shall be a separation of accounts; (iv) any railway undertaking licensed in accordance with EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on fair, non-discriminatory terms; and (v) that infrastructure managers may benefit from State financing. Regulation (EEC) In the context of a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly with the traditional monopolies listed in the Regulation, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to discriminate between these two groups of undertakings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. However, it requested information from Member States about application of the Regulation in May 2010 and in June 2011. Responses revealed that, between 2007 and 2010, a majority of Member States had not received applications from railway undertakings and had not made payments of compensation under the Regulation. A majority of Member States indicated they saw no ongoing need for the Regulation and some explicitly expressed their support for repeal or their opinion that the Regulation is obsolete or out of date. On the basis of the data provided by Member States, it was concluded that the impact of a repeal of the Regulation would be very minimal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91 and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 to eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order and will contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is now obsolete. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: both the Commission and the national competition authorities NCAs have enforced the EU competition rules in close cooperation in the European Competition Network (ECN). The ECN was created in 2004 expressly for this purpose. The national competition authorities of the EU Member States are empowered by Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 to apply the EU competition rules alongside the Commission. Since 2004, the Commission and the NCAs took over 1000 enforcement decisions, with the NCAs being responsible for 85%. The NCAs are usually well placed to act where competition is substantially affected in their territory. NCAs have the expertise on how markets work in their own Member State. However, many NCAs do not have all the tools they need to effectively detect and tackle competition law infringements. The Commission considers that a legislative proposal is therefore needed to empower the NCAs to be more effective enforcers of the EU competition rules to ensure that NCAs have the necessary guarantees of independence and resources and enforcement and fining powers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is to take EU legislative action providing NCAs with minimum means and instruments to be effective enforcers, complemented by both soft action and detailed rules where appropriate. CONTENT: the proposal for a Directive aims to provide NCAs with all the necessary tools to more effectively implement the EU competition rules for employment and growth in order to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market. It seeks to enhance the effectiveness of the NCAs, while not imposing one size fits all so as to allow taking into account Member States‚Äô legal traditions and institutional specificities. The proposal focuses on the following: Independence and resources : the proposal introduces guarantees aiming to protect the staff and management of NCAs from external influence when enforcing the EU competition rules by explicitly excluding instructions from any government or other public or private entity. Moreover, it obliges Member States to ensure that NCAs have the human, financial and technical resources that are necessary to perform their core tasks. Investigative powers : the scope of NCAs' investigative and decision-making powers varies considerably, which can significantly impact on their effectiveness. The proposal provides: for the core minimum effective powers to investigate (the power to inspect business and non-business premises, to issue requests for information) and to take decisions (the power to adopt prohibition decisions including the power to impose structural and behavioural remedies, commitment decisions, and interim measures); effective sanctions in the case of non-compliance of the rules. These sanctions will be calculated in proportion to the total turnover of the undertaking concerned, but Member States will have flexibility in how this is implemented. Fines and periodic penalty payments : fines can vary by up to 25 times depending on which authority act. National administrative competition authorities should have the power to impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive fines. The proposal: provides: (i) that the maximum amount of the fine should not be set at a level below 10% of its total worldwide turnover; (ii) that regard should be given to both the gravity and the duration of the infringement; provides the possibility to impose fines on parent companies and legal and economic successors of undertakings in order to avoid companies escaping from liability for fines simply by restructuring. Leniency : the proposal seeks to increase legal certainty for companies that wish to apply for leniency and thus to maintain their incentives to cooperate with the Commission and the NCAs by reducing the current differences between the leniency programmes applicable in the Member States. It shall ensure that all NCAs can grant immunity and reduction from fines and accept summary applications under the same conditions. It shall guarantee that employees and directors of companies that file for immunity are protected from individual sanctions, where they exist, provided that they cooperate with the authorities. Mutual assistance : when one NCAs requests another NCA to carry out investigative measures on its behalf to gather evidence located in another jurisdiction, officials from the requesting NCA have the right to attend and actively assist in that inspection. In addition, the proposal calls for these arrangements to allow NCAs to request and provide mutual assistance for the notification of decisions and enforcement of fines when companies have no legal presence in the territory of the requesting NCA. The proposal also recalls the importance of the fundamental rights of companies and obliges the authorities to respect appropriate safeguards in the exercise of their powers in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: an indicative amount of EUR 1 million per year is foreseen to maintain, develop, host, operate and support a central information system (European Competition Network System) in compliance with the relevant confidentiality and data security standards. Other administrative costs incurred in connection with the functioning of the ECN, e.g. organisation of meetings, developing and providing training programmes, issuing guidelines and common principles are estimated at EUR 500 000 per year. The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 6.877 million up to 2020 (including human resources and other administrative expenditure)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: since the last revision of the regulatory framework for electronic communications in 2009, the sector has significantly evolved and its role as an enabler of the online economy has grown. Market structures have evolved, with monopolistic market power becoming increasingly limited, and at the same time connectivity for citizens and businesses has become a widely pervasive feature of economic life. These usage and operational changes must be factored into a review of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. The review needs to be seen in light of the Digital Single Market strategy for Europe, in which the Commission announced that it would present proposals in 2016 for an ambitious overhaul of the regulatory framework focusing on: a consistent single market approach to spectrum policy and management; delivering the conditions for a true single market by tackling regulatory fragmentation to allow economies of scale for efficient network operators and service providers and effective protection of consumers; ensuring a level playing field for market players and consistent application of the rules; incentivising investment in high-speed broadband networks; and a more effective regulatory institutional framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the preferred option are as follows: focusing regulation on high-quality connectivity; binding and enforceable rules for enhancing coordination of spectrum management in the EU with greater focus on adapting spectrum rules to the future 5G challenges; incremental adaptation to trends with the focus on voice and broadband affordability; Internet Access Services (IAS) and regulatory obligations for electronic communications services mainly linked to the use of numbering resources; adapting the EU framework on numbering to address competition issues on the market; advisory role for the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC), with certain normative powers for BEREC and improved process for market review and spectrum assignment. CONTENT: the proposal for a European Electronic Communications Code consists of a horizontal recasting of the four existing Directives (the Framework Directive, the Authorisation Directive, the Access Directive and the Universal Service Directive), bringing them all under a single Directive. The proposal focuses on the following points: (i) the new objective of ubiquitous and unconstrained connectivity, (ii) the harmonisation of the competences of national regulatory authorities (NRAs), and (iii) the harmonisation of spectrum-related issues and revised rules on services. Amendments related to access regulation : the amendments aim at reinforcing and improving the SMP access regime currently in place, to further promote infrastructure competition and network deployment by all operators and to sustain the deployment of very high capacity networks throughout the Union‚Äôs territory. The proposal amends market analysis procedures, to ensure that access obligations are imposed only when and where necessary to address retail market failures and to assure end-user outcomes. To sustain the deployment of very high capacity networks throughout the Union territory the amendments: require national regulators to survey the state of broadband networks and investment plans across their national territory, and identify ‚Äòdigital exclusion areas‚Äô where no operator or public authority has deployed or plans to deploy a very high capacity network; clarify the circumstances in which pricing flexibility can be granted to SMP operators, without compromising competition; introduces provisions to facilitate commercial co-investment in new infrastructures and to draw the necessary regulatory consequences. Spectrum management : the proposal provides a clarification of the general objectives and principles to guide Member States when managing spectrum at national level. These objectives and principles address the following points: consistency and proportionality in authorisation procedures; the importance of ensuring appropriate coverage; timing considerations when making spectrum available, the prevention of cross-border or harmful interference, establishing the ‚Äòuse it or lose it‚Äô principle, and fostering shared spectrum use. The proposal targets key aspects of spectrum authorisation with a view to enhancing consistency in Member States practice, such as (i) minimum licence durations (25 years); (ii) clear and simpler process for spectrum trading and leasing, (iii) processes to improve consistency and predictability when granting and renewing individual spectrum usage rights; (iv) clearer conditions for the restriction or withdrawal of existing rights. WiFi access : the proposal simplifies conditions for access to Wi-Fi, to meet the exponential demand for connectivity and for the deployment and provisions of low-power wireless broadband access (small cells) to reduce costs of deploying very dense networks. Universal service : the proposal aims at modernising the universal service regime by removing the mandatory inclusion at EU level of legacy services (public payphones, comprehensive directories and directory enquiry services) from the scope and focusing on the basic universal service broadband. Member States should ensure affordable access to all end-users to functional broadband internet access and voice communications services at least at a fixed location. Services and end-user protection rules : new provisions are proposed, including: better readability of contracts through a short-form summarising the essential contract information; the provision of consumption control tools to inform end-users about their current communications usage; enhanced provisions on price and quality comparison tools, switching rules for the rapidly increasing number of bundles to avoid lock-in effects (key sector-specific provisions, such as maximum contract duration and rights to contract termination, would apply to the entire bundle) and a provision prohibiting discrimination based on nationality or the country of residence. Additionally, in the event of an actual threat to end-to-end connectivity or to effective access to emergency services, the Commission may identify a need for measures to ensure interoperability, for instance through the launch of a standardisation process. Such standards could be imposed by NRAs where necessary. Numbering provisions : in order to address competition issues in the market, the proposal allows national regulators to assign numbers to undertakings other than providers of electronic communications networks and services. It also requires national regulators to determine certain numbering resources for the extraterritorial use of national numbers within the EU. Emergency communications provisions : legal clarity is brought about regarding access to emergency services (single European emergency number 112 by all number-based interpersonal communications service providers. Such an approach ensures cross-border deployment and functioning of technical solutions for emergency communications. Governance: the amendments strengthen the role of independent national regulators by establishing a minimum set of competences for those regulators across the EU and enhance their independence requirements. As regards the procedure for general authorisation, providers should submit notifications to BEREC, which should act as a single contact point and forward the notifications to relevant national regulatory authorities.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) 1211/2009 established the setting up of BEREC and the BEREC Office. Their aim was to contribute to the development and better functioning of the internal market for electronic communications networks and services. BEREC and the BEREC Office have made a positive contribution towards a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. Notwithstanding, there are still significant disparities between Member States as regards regulatory practice. Moreover, the governance structure of BEREC and the BEREC Office is cumbersome and gives rise to unnecessary administrative burden. In order to ensure efficiency gains and synergies and to further contribute to the development of the internal market for electronic communications throughout the Union as well as to the promotion of very high capacity data connectivity, the Commission proposes to strengthen the role of BEREC and enhance its governance structure by establishing BEREC as a Union decentralised agency. BEREC would therefore become a key actor to serve the objective of achieving an internal telecoms market in the Union. In its Communication of 6 May 2015 entitled ‚ÄòA Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe‚Äô, the Commission envisaged presenting proposals in 2016 for an ambitious overhaul of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. The communication pointed out that the changing market and technological environment make it necessary to strengthen the institutional framework by enhancing the role of BEREC. In its resolution ‚ÄòTowards a Digital Single Market Act‚Äô, the European Parliament called on the Commission to integrate further the digital single market by ensuring a more efficient institutional framework by strengthening the role, capacity and decision-making powers of BEREC. Parliaments also stressed the need to improve the financial and human resources and further enhance the governance structure of BEREC. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is to strengthen BEREC‚Äôs advisory role with certain pre-normative powers and better market review process and spectrum assignment of right of use for radio spectrum. CONTENT: the proposal repealing Regulation (EC) 1211/2009 broadens the current mandate of BEREC and turns it into a fully-fledged agency equipped with the necessary tools and adequate resources to achieve its objectives and carry out its tasks. The proposal should be read together with the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the European Electronic Communications Code. Aims: BEREC should aim to achieve the same objectives as NRAs. In particular, it should: ensure a consistent implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications and thereby contribute to the development of the internal market; promote (i) access to, and take-up of, very high capacity data connectivity; (ii) competition in the provision of electronic communications networks, services and associated facilities; and (iii) the interests of the citizens of the Union. Tasks: the proposal sets out additional tasks for BEREC, notably: powers to adopt binding decisions on the identification of transnational markets and on a contract summary template; quasi-binding powers in relation to the internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation (the ‚Äòdouble-lock‚Äô system) and the establishment of a single maximum termination rate for the Union; quasi-binding powers in relation to the internal market procedures for draft national measures on market regulation (the ‚Äòdouble-lock‚Äô system) and the establishment of a single maximum termination rate for the Union. the issuing of guidelines in a number of areas: (i) geographical surveys, (ii) common approaches to meeting transnational demand, (iii) minimum criteria for reference offers, (iv) common criteria for the management of numbering resources, (v) quality-of-service parameters, (vi) applicable measurement methods and the technical details of the cost model to be applied by NRAs when setting maximum symmetric termination rates. It will also be given the power to request information directly from operators; In addition, BEREC: will be in charge of setting up a register for the extraterritorial use of numbers and cross-border arrangements and another register of providers of electronic communications networks and services; assist the Commission and NRAs in the area of standardisation by helping them identify a threat to end-to-end connectivity or to effective access to emergency services. In a ‚Äòdouble-lock‚Äô system, if BEREC and the Commission agree on their position regarding the draft remedies an NRA proposes, the Commission could require the NRA to amend or withdraw the draft measure and, if necessary, to re-notify the market analysis. A ‚Äòpeer review‚Äô system within BEREC will also be introduced as a new coordination mechanism to improve efficiency and coherence amongst Member States with regard to regulatory market aspects of assignments of rights of use for radio spectrum. Administrative and management structure : this comprises a Management Board, an Executive Director, Working Groups and a Board of Appeal. The Executive Director manages the agency and will be its legal representative. The Executive Director is accountable to the Management Board and shall report to the European Parliament BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial resources necessary for BEREC to fulfil its mission amount to EUR 14 135 million for the period 2019-2020. In addition to the contribution from the Union, BEREC may collect charges for publications and other services provided, contributions from third countries or the electronic communications regulatory authorities of third countries participating in the work of BEREC and voluntary contributions from the Member States and NRAs."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a common classification of territorial units for statistics (Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics NUTS) in order to enable the collection, compilation and dissemination of harmonised regional statistics in the EU. These statistics are widely used in the context of EU regional policy and to determine eligibility for regions under the cohesion funds. Over the past few years, Eurostat has expanded the range of statistics published on a number of territorial typologies to address EU policy-makers‚Äô increasing need for such data. The Commission has defined these territorial typologies in cooperation with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and adopted methodologies to set up and maintain them. The European Statistical System (ESS) already uses those typologies, in particular the degree of urbanisation, including the definition of cities in order, for instance, to define eligibility for European Regional Development Fund support to carry out innovative actions in cities or towns and suburbs. However, the NUTS Regulation does not yet include or legally define these territorial typologies to determine urban, rural, coastal and/or other areas and regions in the EU, although they are already being used. The fact that these typologies and their methodologies have no legal recognition and are not formally recognised by the European Statistical System (ESS) is an issue that needs to be addressed to establish them as recognised, impartial and transparent statistical typologies. CONTENT: it is proposed to amend or replace some provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 in order to incorporate typologies into the NUTS Regulation which interlink with several statistical domains, like regional accounts, the labour market, rural development, agriculture, tourism, maritime policy and more. It would make it possible to aggregate data according to clear-cut typologies: for instance making it possible to compare GDP in rural as opposed to urban areas, tourist nights spent in coastal as opposed to non-coastal areas and regions, employment/unemployment by degree of urbanisation and much more. The main policy objectives of the initiative are the following. establish a legal recognition of territorial typologies, including the definition of cities, for the purpose of European statistics : this will make it possible for thematic statistical regulations and policy initiatives to refer to these territorial typologies for the purpose of collecting European statistics and/or to target specific territories such as cities, urban, rural or coastal areas and regions in policy. The initiative will therefore cover the existing territorial typologies based on NUTS level 3 (e.g. urban-rural typology, metropolitan regions), the local administrative units (e.g. degree of urbanisation, cities, coastal areas) and the 1 km¬≤ grid level required to calculate the other typologies, which are based on population distribution and density in the grid cells; lay down the core definitions and statistical criteria for the different territorial typologies. For this purpose, the initiative will use the already existing methodologies for the different typologies; ensure harmonised and transparent application and use of the territorial typologies at EU level and in Member States; to align the NUTS Regulation to the new rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), powers currently conferred on the Commission by that regulation to adopt acts designed to amend non-essential elements of the regulation by supplementing it, in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, should be provided for by powers to adopt delegated acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."
6311,4801,148.0,1.0,14.11.2017,Recognition of professional qualifications in inland navigation,***I,Leg,Draft legislative resolution,s,Meissner,A8-0338/2016,2016/0050/COD,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A8-2016-0338&language=EN,Committee on Transport and Tourism,Transport & tourism,Provisional agreement,0.0,131,committee,RCV,+,609,32,44,4.0,44.0,1.0,44.0,14.0,0.0,8.0,8.0,0.057,0.917,0.005,0.88,0.269,0.0,0.042,0.154,0,0,0,0,https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/ficheprocedure.do?lang=en&reference=2016/0050(COD),https://oeil.secure.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/popups/summary.do?id=1424248&t=e&l=en,"PURPOSE: to facilitate labour mobility in the inland waterway transport sector by ensuring that skilled workers‚Äô qualifications are recognised throughout the Union. PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: inland waterway transport (IWT) is a cost-saving and energy-efficient transport mode that could be used more efficiently to support the European Union‚Äôs energy efficiency, growth and industrial development goals. However, its contribution is hampered by difficulties in terms of labour mobility, persistent vacancies and skills mismatches, which continue in spite of attempts by the sector to tackle the problems at bilateral and multilateral level. Varying minimum requirements for professional qualifications across the Member States do not provide sufficient assurance for individual countries as regards the recognition of professional qualifications of crew from other Member States, in particular as this also affects the safety of navigation. Based on over 19 years of experience with the implementation of Directives 96/50/EC and 91/672/EEC, the Commission considered it necessary to propose to extend the scope of recognition of professional qualifications beyond the level of boat masters to all crew involved in the operation of vessels, including on the Rhine river. The initiative responds to long-standing calls from the sector and Member States to revise the existing outdated legal framework and replace it with a modern, competence-based framework. It has been prepared under the Commission‚Äôs policy framework for promoting inland waterway transport, NAIADES II. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy option introducing minimum competence requirements for boatmen and boat masters, including examination standards for training institutes, has been chosen. This option is preferred as it offers a more effective way to improve labour mobility than the ‚Äòdo nothing‚Äô and the ‚Äòvoluntary measures‚Äô options. CONTENT: the proposal repeals Directive 91/672/EEC and Directive 96/50/EC and provides for gradual phasing-in with transitional measures and extends the requirements to cover all crew in inland navigation in the EU, including on the Rhine river. This Directive lays down the conditions and procedures for the certification of the qualifications of persons involved in the operation of a vessel for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union, as well as the recognition of such qualifications in the Member States. Union certificate of qualification : the proposal lays down: the obligation for deck crew members, persons in charge of emergency situations on board passenger vessels and persons involved in the bunkering of liquefied natural gas-fuelled vessels to hold certificates of qualification proving their qualifications; that boat masters sailing in circumstances presenting a particular safety hazard should hold a specific authorisation, in particular, for sailing large convoys, sailing liquefied natural gas-fuelled vessels, sailing in conditions of reduced visibility, sailing on waterways with a maritime character or sailing on waterways with specific risks for navigation. In order to obtain such authorisation, boat masters should be required to demonstrate additional competences. For ensuring safety of navigation, Member States should identify waterways with a maritime character, in accordance with harmonised criteria. They should also have the possibility to identify the waterways entailing specific risks for navigation. Member States should issue certificates of qualification only to persons that have the minimum levels of competence, the minimum age, the minimum medical fitness and the navigation time required for obtaining a specific qualification. Recognition : certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks, issued in accordance with the Rhine Navigation Personnel Regulation under the Revised Convention for Rhine Navigation which lay down requirements that are identical to those of this Directive should be valid on all Union inland waterways. To instil the necessary confidence among the Member States in the mechanism for mutual recognition, the requirements in terms of quality standards with respect to assessment of competences and skills, recognition of training programmes. The proposal includes information on certified qualifications in a database kept by the Commission or a designated body is necessary to streamline the exchange of information between the Member States and to ensure efficient implementation of the initiative. DELEGATED ACT: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for enforcement of consumer protection laws (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation, the ""CPC Regulation"") has strengthened the enforcement of consumer laws across the EU. However, a high level of non-compliance with the key Union consumer rules persists in the main consumer markets. The coordinated screenings of online e-commerce websites (""sweeps"") carried out by CPC authorities since 2007 show rates of non-compliance with basic consumer rules, between 32% and 69%, in the checked markets. Further, a conservative estimate based on a representative sample of five online sectors (clothing, electronic goods, recreation, consumer credit and package travel) shows that 37% of EU e-commerce did not respect Union consumer law in 2014. The Commission evaluation report under the CPC Regulation concluded that the current Regulation needs to be replaced to respond to the challenges of the digital economy and the development of cross-border retail trade in the EU. A legislative proposal is therefore needed to address the identified shortcomings of the CPC Regulation. The general objective of the proposal is to develop modern, efficient and effective CPC mechanisms that will reduce the consumer detriment caused by cross-border and widespread infringements to Union consumer law. The Single Market strategy adopted by the Commission on 28 October 2015 further reiterated that the Commission will improve the enforcement of Union consumer law by national authorities through the reform of the CPC Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the five policy options examined, the preferred option is the option to revise the CPC Regulation by extending its scope and strengthening its efficiency. It was estimated for the subset of five online markets studied in the impact assessment that a decrease of 10 points in the non-compliance rate of 37% could reduce the detriment from an estimated EUR 770 million per year to about EUR 539 million, i.e. by 30%. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to modernise the current CPC Regulation, by deepening the level of harmonisation, in order to address the above issues and to boost the cross-border enforcement of Union consumer laws in the Single Market. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Introductory provisions : the proposal updates the definitions to take account the extension of the Regulation to widespread infringements and ceased infringements (infringements of short duration that ceased before enforcement measures can be taken, but which may be causing harm to consumers afterwards. It introduces a limitation period for the possibility to impose penalties (five years from the termination of such infringements) and sets rules for the calculation of the limitation period and for its suspension. Competent authorities and their powers : this Chapter: (i) defines how to designate competent authorities and single liaison offices for this Regulation; (ii) clarifies the roles of the single liaison offices; (iii) calls on the Member States to ensure smooth cooperation among the members of the enforcement network in their territory; (iv) requires Member States to ensure that other national authorities support the work of the competent authorities. Further minimum powers have been added, such as the power to make test purchases and carry out mystery shopping, power to adopt interim measures, block websites and the power to impose penalties and to safeguard consumer compensation in a cross-border context. Mutual Assistance Mechanism : this mechanism shall be used to address intra-Union infringements, which affect consumers in one Member State but have a cross-border element (e.g. the responsible trader is located in another Member State). The proposal newly sets out that the requested authority has an obligation to reply to a mutual assistance request within the time limit set by implementing measures. Coordinated surveillance, investigation and enforcement mechanism for widespread infringements : the proposal provides for instruments to address widespread infringements. These include coordinated actions, common actions against widespread infringements with Union-dimension and concerted investigations of consumer markets. The proposal also establishes a new instrument to address widespread infringements with Union-dimension which are likely to harm consumers in a large part of the Union. It sets out the thresholds that determine which suspected infringements have a Union-dimension. The Commission establishes whether the thresholds for Union-dimension are fulfilled and launches the common action by decision. It has also an obligation to coordinate investigation and other measures that Member States need to take to stop the infringement. Participation in a common action is mandatory for competent authorities in Member States concerned by the infringement. Surveillance Mechanism : the new surveillance mechanism replaces the current CPC system of alerts. It combines the alerts under the current CPC Regulation with wider exchange of information that is relevant and necessary for timely detection of widespread infringements. Other entities may participate in the alert mechanism through external alerts. Professional and commercial secrecy : the proposed Regulation ensures protection of professional and commercial secrets. It also provides that the information collected using the minimum powers under the Regulation will only be used for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the laws that protect consumers' interests. Annex: it is proposed to include the following EU legislative act to the Annex of the CPC Regulation: Directive on consumer rights; Directive on services in the internal market; Directive on credit agreements; Directive on payment accounts; Regulation on railway passenger rights and obligations; Regulation concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air; Regulation on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission estimated that there will be approximately four common actions per year against widespread infringements with Union-dimension. This will trigger an additional workload for the Commission, estimated to require two full-time officials to coordinate these common actions. These resources will be obtained through the redistribution and refocusing of the existing personnel. The Commission will also incur additional costs in monitoring the functioning of the mutual assistance and alert mechanisms. The Commission's total additional costs for its enhanced coordination and monitoring role are estimated to be below EUR 300 000 per year and these costs will be covered by internal reallocation of resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the implementation and monitoring of EU policies relies on comparable and high-quality statistical information about the economic, social and environmental situation in the EU and its components at national and regional level. European statistics are also indispensable if ‚ÄòEurope‚Äô is to be understood by the general public. The current ESP, as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 99/2013 and covering the period from 2013 to 2017, is the eighth programme of its kind. Although national statistical systems have made a significant effort to modernise their production methods with the support of the 2013-2017 European statistical programme (ESP), the current statistical production infrastructure is still not flexible enough to deliver new statistics when needed, while also limiting the associated cost and administrative burden. In order to satisfy the information needs stemming from the Commission‚Äôs 10 political priorities, a number of urgent statistical gaps need to be addressed. Furthermore, the timeliness of some European statistics needs to be improved urgently, so that they provide the more up-to-date information needed in the context of the European Semester exercise. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is an amended ESP, including new statistical outputs to align statistical production with the Commission‚Äôs 10 political priorities, complemented by major initiatives to reduce the burden on respondents and costs to NSIs, and increased annual budget CONTENT : by amending Regulation (EU) No 99/2013, the aim of the proposal is to extend the ESP 2013-2017 for the period 2018-2020 and provide the financial support that the European statistical system (ESS) needs in order to be able to: provide high-quality statistical information and close the statistical gaps that need to be addressed most urgently, focusing on a number of priority areas that reflect the Commission‚Äôs 10 political priorities for jobs, growth, fairness and democratic change and other Union policies such as the European Semester, the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and the European Energy Union; implement new methods on production of European statistics aiming to achieve efficiency gains and improvement in quality; strengthen partnership within the ESS and beyond in order to further increase its productivity and secure its leading role in official statistics worldwide. In specific terms, the proposal amends the ESP 2013-2017, including new statistical outputs to align statistical production with the Commission‚Äôs 10 political priorities, complemented by major initiatives to modernise the methods for producing statistics, reduce the burden on respondents and costs to national statistical institutes (NSIs). In particular, the initiative will underpin Union policies in the following areas: social indicators to strengthen the EU social dimension, European monetary union and the social impact analysis of macroeconomic policies; further statistical work to analyse the growth and employment impact of technological change and innovation and to put in place a circular economy monitoring system; more detailed data on energy consumption and better early estimates of energy balances; statistics on online cross-border selling for the ‚Äòdigital single market‚Äô priority (accessing services provided by intermediaries in content distribution; trust in online platforms and intermediaries; barriers faced by households making crossborder purchases); a harmonised house price index and related statistics in the context of assessing Member States‚Äô structural reforms; statistics to help the EU to steer and monitor the impact of its external policies and assistance programmes, and to contribute to good governance and democratic debate in partner countries.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal is part of the work undertaken to stimulate investments in growing and innovative firms. The Investment Plan for Europe presents a global strategy to increase competitiveness and stimulate investments for the purpose of job creation. It aims to further mobilise additional private investment using public funds through the European Fund for Strategic Investment (""EFSI""). A key strand of the Investment Plan is the Capital Markets Union (""CMU"") action plan, which contains a range of measures to remove capital market barriers and facilitate the financing of SMEs. Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) 346/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down uniform requirements and conditions for managers of collective investment undertakings that wish to use in the Union the ‚ÄòEuVECA‚Äô or ‚ÄòEuSEF‚Äô designations for the marketing of qualifying venture capital funds and qualifying social entrepreneurship funds. While EuVECA funds support young and innovative companies, EuSEF funds focus on enterprises whose aim is to achieve positive social impact. The Commission is seeking to ensure that the EuVECA and EuSEF frameworks work as well as possible in supporting venture capital and social investment. However, the review of the two Regulations under the REFIT initiative (Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme) identified a number of factors holding back the development of these funds, in particular: limitations on large managers whose portfolios exceed EUR 500 million, who may not use the ""EuVECA"" and ""EuSEF"" labels, a EUR 100,000 minimum entry ticket for non-professional investors and specific limitations on eligible investments (i.e. the definition of qualifying portfolio undertakings); differing requirements in different jurisdictions, in particular set-up fees, additional costs charged by host Member States and the required levels of sufficient own funds. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the options retained by the impact assessment are as follows : allow managers authorized under Directive 2011/61/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (""AIFMD"") to use the ""EuVECA"" and ""EuSEF"" labels; expand the definition of qualifying portfolio undertakings in Regulation (EU) 345/2013; maintain the EUR 100,000 minimum investment; include explicit provisions in the two Regulations (to avoid burdensome administrative processes and additional measures (including fees imposed by host Member States) and non-proportionate requirements imposed by home Member States. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 on European venture capital funds and Regulation (EU) 346/2013 on European social entrepreneurship funds. The amendments aim to: allow managers authorised under Directive 2011/61/EU that manage portfolios above EUR 500 to use the ‚ÄòEuVECA‚Äô and ‚ÄòEuSEF‚Äô designations respectively in relation to the marketing of those funds in the Union; amend the definition of qualifying portfolio undertaking in Regulation (EU) No 345/2013 and include unlisted undertakings which employ up to 499 persons and small and medium-sized enterprises listed on a SME growth market; entrust ESMA with the development of draft regulatory technical standards specifying the methodologies for the determination of sufficient own funds; reduce costs by explicitly providing that fees and other charges may not be imposed by competent authorities of host Member States in relation to cross-border marketing of EuVECA and EuSEF funds, by simplifying registration procedures and determining minimum capital requirements to be a manager."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to address the EU‚Äôs need for a stronger Europe when it comes to foreign policy to better contribute to supporting development and securing peace and prosperity in the world. The Commission stated that it is essential to support security sector actors, including the military under exceptional circumstances, in third countries in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Those actions are particularly necessary to ensure the protection of civilian populations in the areas affected by conflict, crises or fragility. The 2005 European Consensus on Development recognised the link between security and development. The United Nations‚Äô 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015, underlined the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 16) and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes. In the Joint Communication entitled ‚ÄòCapacity building in support of security and development ‚Äì Enabling partners to prevent and manage crisis‚Äô, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy reiterated the need for stable and secure societies in order to achieve development objectives The Council conclusions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of 18 May 2015 called to explore options to: (i) enhance coherence and coordination between EU security and development actions, as well as to; (ii) improve the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development, notably in terms of financing instruments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that an amendment of the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) would be the most appropriate and effective short-term option. It also explained that a comprehensive implementation of the CBSD initiative (i.e. including support to the military for defence-related purposes) would require combining a budgetary instrument (for development tasks) with another, possibly extra-budgetary, mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal aims to insert a new Article into Title II of Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 in order to extend the Union‚Äôs assistance under exceptional circumstances to be used to build the capacity of military actors. The specific objectives of the proposal are to: contribute to improving the capacity of partner countries to prevent and manage crises by themselves; contribute to improving the effectiveness of the Union‚Äôs development actions by working with all security actors, including the military, through the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development by the EU, as soon as possible, flexibly and comprehensively; contribute to ensuring the respect of the rule of law, good governance as well as enhanced civilian control and oversight over the military in third countries. Types of Union assistance : Union assistance may be used to build the capacity of military actors in partner countries under exceptional circumstances, in order to contribute to sustainable development and in particular to the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies. The type of activities that may be supported include capacity building programmes in support of security and development, including training, mentoring and advice, as well as the provision of equipment, infrastructure improvements and provision of other services. Union assistance shall not be used to finance: (i) recurrent military expenditure; (ii) the procurement of arms and ammunition; (iii) training which is solely designed to contribute to the fighting capacity of the armed forces. Exceptional circumstances : assistance shall only be provided in the following circumstances: where requirements cannot be met by recourse to non-military actors to adequately reach Union objectives under this Regulation; where the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies is denied by a serious threat to the existence of functioning State institutions, as well as to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or State institutions can no longer cope with this serious threat; and where a consensus exists between the country concerned and the international community and/or the European Union that the security sector, and in particular the military, are key for stability, peace and development, particularly in crises and fragile contexts and situations. When designing and implementing measures, the Commission shall: (i) promote ownership by the partner country; (ii) develop the necessary elements and the good practices required for ensuring sustainability in the medium and long term and; (iii) promote the rule of law and established international law principle. Monitoring and evaluation procedures : Union assistance may be provided through exceptional assistance measures and interim response programmes, thematic strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes. Thematic strategy papers shall provide a framework for cooperation between the Union and the partner countries or regions concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in terms of cost, a budget of EUR 100 000 000 over the period 2017-2020 would be required. The initiative will be financed through redeployment within Heading IV of the general budget of the Union. No additional resources would be mobilised. Implementation will be governed by Regulation (EU) No 236/2014."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Switzerland, of the other, on the free movement of persons was signed on 21 June 1999 and entered into force on 1 June 2002. It has since been extended twice, notably to states in eastern Europe: first of all to the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (entry into force in 2006) and Bulgaria and Romania (entry into force in 2009). It is now necessary to revise the 2002 Agreement to take account of Croatia‚Äôs accession to the EU on 1 July 2013. On 24 September 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Switzerland with a view to concluding the relevant protocol. The negotiations were successfully concluded by the initialling of the Protocol. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Switzerland of the other, on the free movement of persons to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union. Principles: the Protocol seeks to revise the 2002 Agreement in order to take into account the accession of Croatia as regards the free movement of persons. It is provided that for a period of 7 years from the entry into force of the Protocol, Switzerland may limit the access of Croatian citizens into the labour market (quotas, priority to local workers, control of working conditions and wages). During the last two years of this transition period, the restrictions must be accepted by a mixed Switzerland-EU committee. Labour market restrictions: Switzerland may maintain quantitative limits in respect of access by workers employed in Switzerland and for self-employed persons who are nationals of Croatia for the following two categories of residence: N.B.: the draft Protocol does not provide any restrictions on residence of less than four months. The quantitative limits are set for each year of the Protocol‚Äôs seven year implementation. The quotas for each year are progressive so that Switzerland may open gradually, year by year, its labour market to Croatian workers. Regular labour market and controls: further provisions are laid down to enable Switzerland and Croatia to maintain the controls on the priority of workers integrated into the regular labour market and the wage and working conditions applicable to nationals of the other Contracting Party concerned. The same controls may be maintained for persons providing services in the following sectors: Review of the Protocol: before the end of the transitional period, the Joint Committee shall review the functioning of the transitional period applied to nationals of Croatia on the basis of a report from Switzerland. Upon completion of the review, Switzerland shall notify the Joint Committee whether it will continue applying quantitative limits to workers employed in Switzerland. Switzerland may continue to apply such measures for five years after the entry into force of the aforementioned Protocol. Croatia should be entitled to introduce the same quantitative limits for Swiss nationals for the same periods. Safeguard clause: at the end of the 7-year period of the Protocol, Switzerland shall have the opportunity for a further three years, to unilaterally activate the safeguard clause against Croatian citizens with a view to limiting the number of residence permits to allow them to work. Specific provisions are laid down to this effect. Duration of the transitional period: the total transition period with safeguard clause ‚Äì if applicable ‚Äì is 10 years from the date of entry into force of the Protocol. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment (TSS) was set up by Council Decision 2003/174/EC, which formalised the practice of holding highlevel, informal meetings since 1997 in the framework of the European Employment Strategy, and subsequently the Lisbon Strategy. This Decision was proposed to institutionalise the practice of high-level consultation between the EU institutions and the EU social partners. The proposal meant abolishing the former Standing Committee on Employment, which was set up in 1970 and reformed in 1999. Since 2003, the TSS has been a separate event from the European Council meetings and has broadly fulfilled its aim of facilitating the exchange of views at the highest level between the Commission, the EU Presidency and the EU social partners on employment and social aspects of the Lisbon Strategy (since 2010, and then of the Europe 2020 Strategy). Until the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the meetings were co-chaired by the Council Presidency and the President of the Commission. The 2003 Decision also gave a role to the two subsequent Presidencies. In its Communication of 2 October 2013 on the social dimension of the EMU, the Commission announced that it will present a proposal to revise the 2003 Council Decision. This is the aim of this proposal. The amendment of the 2003 Council Decision is also needed as a result of the institutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon. In addition, the overall policy framework needs to be revised, replacing the Lisbon Strategy with the Europe 2020 Strategy and specifying how the TSS for Growth and Employment contributes to the overall governance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to revise the 2003 Council Decision. The main provisions may be summarised as follows: Task: its tasks shall be to: Membership: the main amendments concern the membership of the TSS. The Summit shall consist of the: President of the European Council, The ministers from those three presidencies and the Commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs shall also be present. The social partners‚Äô representatives shall be divided into two delegations of equal size comprising 10 workers‚Äô representatives and 10 employers‚Äô representatives, taking into account the need to ensure a balanced participation between men and women. Each delegation shall consist of representatives of European cross-industry organisations, either representing general interests or more specific interests of supervisory and managerial staff and small and medium-sized businesses at European level. Technical coordination shall be provided for the workers‚Äô delegation by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and for the employers‚Äô delegation by the Confederation of European Business (BUSINESSEUROPE). Technical provisions are set out as regards: Presidency and organisation: the Summit shall be chaired jointly by the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. The meetings of the Summit shall be convened by the joint chairmen on their own initiative, in consultation with the social partners."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The negotiations have been concluded and the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States (comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland (BLMNS) and South Africa). The negotiations were completed at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. The Agreement was initialled on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. It should be noted that: The SADC EPA will provide a uniform access regime for the BLMNS countries. For South Africa, the SADC EPA will replace the relevant provisions of Titles II and III of the TDCA, dealing respectively with trade and trade related issues. It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt a Decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States, the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States, of the other part. Scope and purpose of the Agreement: the Agreement contains provisions on: The Agreement also contains rendez-vous clauses on trade in services and investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and public procurement. Trade provisions: the SADC EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement. It offers asymmetric market access to the SADC EPA States, which allows them to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation; it provides a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection; it contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate exports; and it eliminates the use of export subsidies in trade between the Parties. The EPA guarantees duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Swaziland, with the exception of arms and ammunition. South Africa will benefit from new market access additional to the TDCA, that currently governs its trade relations with the EU. The EU will obtain meaningful new market access into the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and will have the security of a bilateral agreement with Mozambique, one of the LDCs in the region. The EPA is designed to be compatible with the operation of SACU, in particular by fully harmonising SACU's import trade regime. SACU presents a single external schedule of tariffs and quota arrangements applied to imports from the EU. The SADC EPA also contains a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development that links the trade agreement to EU objectives in the field of labour, environment, and climate change. Institutional provisions and monitoring: the Parties undertake to continuously monitor the operation and impact of this Agreement. The institutional provisions establish a Joint Council at Ministerial level to be responsible for the operation and implementation of the Agreement and to monitor the fulfilment of its objectives. The Joint Council shall be assisted by a Trade and Development Committee. Furthermore, the Agreement: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is without budgetary implications on Union expenditure but will have a budgetary impact on the revenue side. Thus, foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 33.3 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years. This estimate is based on the average volume of imports over the period 2012-2014. With the exception of a number of products imported from South Africa, imports from the SADC EPA Group already enter the European Union duty free."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: driving and resting times of drivers are regulated under EU law. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (the 'Driving Time Regulation') and Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs are part of a wider effort to improve the working conditions of drivers, ensure fair competition between operators and improve the road safety of European roads. An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‚Äòlight commercial vehicles‚Äô): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: aviation plays a fundamental role in the European Union economy. In 2014, the sector supported the employment of up to 9.3 million people and accounted for over EUR 510 billion of EU Gross Domestic Product. In 2015, more than 1.45 billion passengers departed from or arrived at EU airports. The Union's overall connectivity relies on air services performed by Union air carriers (average of 7 million flights per year) and on third country air carriers (1.3 million flights per year). The liberalisation and deregulation of international air transport has fostered unprecedented competition within the Union market and globally. Global competition is expected to further intensify in coming years with projected international aviation growth of around 5% per year until 2030. Principles of fair competition have not yet been defined through specific multilateral rules, notably in the context of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) nor of World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, from the scope of which air transport services have largely been excluded. EU rules ensure that all carriers, European and non-European, are granted the same rights and same opportunity of accessing air transport related services. This may not however be the case in some third countries where discriminatory practices and subsidies may give unfair competitive advantages to air carriers from those third countries. In its Communication on an Aviation Strategy for Europe, the Commission stated its intention to assess the effectiveness of Regulation (EC) No 868/2004 with a view to revising or replacing it with a more effective instrument that would ensure fair competition conditions between all carriers and thereby safeguard connectivity to and from the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the chosen option consists of replacing Regulation (EC) No 868/2004 with a new instrument and increasing efforts on the international scene including as regards the negotiation of air transport or services agreements. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation shall replace Regulation (EC) No 868/2004 and aims to ensure fair competition between Union air carriers and third country air carriers, in the interest of maintaining conditions conducive to a high level of Union connectivity. The proposal lays down rules on the conduct of investigations by the Commission and on the adoption of redressive measures, relating to violation of applicable international obligations and to practices affecting competition between Union air carriers and other air carriers and causing or threatening to cause injury to Union air carriers. Proceedings : the proposal stipulates that an investigation shall be initiated following a written complaint submitted by a Member State, a Union air carrier or an association of Union air carriers, or on the Commission's own initiative. The Commission may decide not to initiate an investigation where the adoption of measures would be against the Union interest. It may seek all the information it deems necessary to conduct the investigation and may verify the accuracy of the information it has received or collected. The proposal also defines (i) the rules under which an investigation is to be conducted, and the conditions under which interested parties may have access to information relating to the investigation; (ii) the rules relating to cooperation with Member States, confidentiality and disclosure. Redressive and compensatory measures : in order to be able to propose a measure, the Commission will have to demonstrate that an EU airline has been affected by an unfair practice on the part of a third country. To this end, the proposal: establishes the conditions under which conditions the existence of injury or threat of injury may be found; sets out the conditions according to which proceedings may be suspended or concluded, with or without the adoption of redressive measures; provides for the possibility to adopt financial or operational measures intended to offset injury or threat of injury and requires that the measures must not exceed what is necessary for such offsetting bearing in mind that the objective of such measures does not consist in punishing the third country air carrier concerned but in restoring fair competition; defines the conditions under which the redressive measures may be reviewed. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: these are related to the initiation and conduct of investigations by the European Commission, and to financial duties. This instrument is expected to require nine officers for its implementation. The impact on administrative expenditure is estimated at EUR 3.786 million for the period 2018-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal concerns the recast of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport statistics. The codification is carried out in the interests of clarity, given that the Regulation has been substantially amended several times. The new regulation will replace the various acts incorporated therein, whilst fully preserving its substance. CONTENT: the objective of this Regulation is to establish common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at Union level. Statistics on the transport of goods and passengers by rail are necessary: to enable the Commission to: (i) monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies relating to the regions and to trans-European networks; (ii) monitor Union action in the field of transport safety; in order to fulfil the monitoring tasks provided for in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. Scope of the Regulation : this proposed Regulation shall cover all railways in the Union. Each Member State shall report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory. Where a railway undertaking operates in more than one Member State, the national authorities concerned shall require the undertaking to provide data separately for each country in which it operates so as to enable national statistics to be compiled. Member States may exclude from the scope of this Regulation: railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours; railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways. The annual statistics to be collected on the carriage of goods and passengers are set out in the Annexes to the Regulation. The proposal states that Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure the quality of the data transmitted. The quality of the statistical data shall be evaluated by Eurostat. By 31 December 2020 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall report on the implementation of the Regulation and on future developments. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 92/66/EEC lays down the measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in poultry and certain birds. The Directive confers on the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, the power to amend the Directive‚Äôs Annexes. Thus, the Council may amend Annexes V, VI and VII to Directive 92/66/EEC which set out respectively (i) the indication of the European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle disease as well as its functions and duties, (ii) the model form to be used by Member States in order to report on the disease situation and the control measures applied; and (iii) the criteria to be applied by Member States for drawing up contingency plans specifying the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak the disease. It is necessary to simplify and streamline the procedures regarding the control of Newcastle disease, in particular taking into account the new rules in relation to the designation of European Union reference laboratories provided for by Article 93 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and also the new system of implementing acts provided for in Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The current European reference laboratory (EURL) for Newcastle disease is located in the United Kingdom. Hence, it needs to be replaced by an EURL located in one of the other 27 Member States in view of the United Kingdom exiting the EU. The current procedure for designating an EURL for Newcastle disease is via a Council Directive. This technical revision of the Directive 92/66/EEC will enable the use of the required implementing procedure to designate a new EURL for Newcastle disease within the tight deadlines related to BREXIT. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to amend Council Directive 92/66/EEC in order to ensure consistency with the TFEU and the new provisions on official controls with a view to simplifying procedures. It aims to delete Annexes V, VI and VII of that Directive and to confer on the Commission implementing powers in the matters covered by those Annexes. These powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (comitology Regulation). The proposal provides that the Commission shall designate, by means of implementing acts, a European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle disease. For the sake of clarity, it sets out the function and duties of the European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle Disease as well as the criteria applicable to the contingency plans to be established by Member States in the event of the onset of the disease."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Georgia continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The EU-Georgia Association Agreement, which includes the gradual introduction of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), was signed in June 2014 and entered into force on 1 July 2016. Georgia continues to face a weak external environment, which, through reduced exports and remittances, has contributed to the relatively subdued GDP growth of 2.7% in 2016 (compared to 2.9% in 2015 and 4.6% in 2014). Georgia‚Äôs fiscal deficit remains significant and its public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased. Georgia‚Äôs balance of payments position remains vulnerable due to a very large current account deficit and high external debt. In this context, the Georgian authorities and the IMF agreed, in April 2017, on a three-year (2017-2020) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in the amount of USD 285.3 million. The aim of the EFF arrangement is to support an economic reform programme which will help Georgia reduce economic vulnerabilities, and promote higher and more inclusive economic growth. In view of Georgia‚Äôs residual external financing needs, the Georgian authorities requested complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in June 2017. The proposed new MFA operation is the third one after Georgia‚Äôs military conflict with Russia in August 2008. The first of those operations (EUR 46 million, fully in the form of grants) was implemented in 2009-2010 and the second (again EUR 46 million, half in grants and half loans) in 2015-2017. The EU‚Äôs macro-financial assistance is an exceptional emergency instrument aimed at addressing severe balance-of-payment difficulties in third countries. Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Georgia‚Äôs balance of payments over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Georgia is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Georgia‚Äôs request for support to the economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposed new MFA operation under consideration would amount to a maximum of EUR 45 million. It will help Georgia cover part of the external financing needs for the period of 2017-2020, which are estimated at USD 752 million. The operation will reduce the economy‚Äôs short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities. It will be designed and implemented in coordination with the adjustment and reform programmes Georgia has agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as with the reforms agreed in the context of the EU‚Äôs budget support operations and the DCFTA. The Commission proposes to provide the amount of the assistance in the form of medium-term loans of up to EUR 35 million and grants of up to EUR 10 million. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in two instalments. Disbursements would be conditional on successful reviews under the IMF programme and on the effective drawing by Georgia on IMF funds. The Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on a specific set of structural reform measures, to be defined in a Memorandum of Understanding. These reform measures would support the authorities‚Äô reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank. A pre-condition for granting the Union‚Äôs macro-financial assistance shall be that Georgia respects effective democratic mechanisms ‚Äì including a multi-party parliamentary system ‚Äì and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union‚Äôs macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems in Georgia. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service The Commission should also regularly inform the Council and the Parliament about developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: assistance shall be provided in the form of a loan and grants. The loan part will be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. Assuming that the two loan disbursements (of EUR 15 million for the first tranche and EUR 20 million for the second tranche) will be made in 2018, the provisioning will take place in the 2020 budget, in accordance with the rules governing the Guarantee Fund mechanism, for an amount of EUR 3.15 million. The grant element of the assistance (EUR 10 million in total, i.e. EUR 5 million for each of the two tranches) will be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2018 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macro-financial assistance), with payments also taking place in 2018."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: mercury is a highly toxic substance which represents a global and major threat to human health, including by methylmercury in fish and seafood resources, the ecosystems and wildlife. Due to the transboundary nature of mercury pollution, between 40% and 80% of total mercury deposition in the Union originates from outside of the Union and therefore warrants action at local, regional, national and international levels. The Union and 26 Member States have signed in Kumamoto on 11 October 2013 the Minamata Convention on Mercury, negotiated under the auspices of UNEP. The Convention addresses the whole life-cycle of mercury, from primary mercury mining to the management of mercury waste, with the objective to protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land. Much of the Minamata Convention is already covered by Union legislation. Regulation (EC) No 1102/2008 sets an export prohibition on mercury and on several mercury compounds, qualifies mercury from certain sources as waste and establishes rules on the storage of mercury. The assessment of the Union acquis has identified a limited number of regulatory gaps that need to be filled in to ensure the full alignment of Union legislation with the Convention. This proposal seeks to address those gaps, which concern the following issues: the import of mercury; the export of certain mercury-added products; the use of mercury in certain manufacturing processes; new mercury uses in products and manufacturing processes; mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM), mercury use in dental amalgam. This proposal aims at transposing into the Union acquis the provisions of the Minamata Convention that are not yet covered by EU legal requirements in order to enable the Union and the Member States to ratify and implement that Convention. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that the ratification and implementation of the Minamata Convention will provide the EU with significant environmental and human health benefits, mainly due to the expected reduction of mercury emissions originating in other parts of the world. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to replace Regulation (EC) No 1102/2008. It establishes measures and conditions concerning the trade, manufacture, use and interim storage of mercury, mercury compounds, mixtures, mercury-added products and the management of mercury waste. Trade and manufacturing restrictions concerning mercury : the proposal: sets a prohibition on the export from the Union of mercury, of several mercury compounds and of mixtures of mercury with other substances, save in respect of those mercury compounds that can still be exported when aimed at laboratory-scale research; prohibits the import into the Union of mercury when intended for artisanal and small-scale gold mining and puts up a conditional prohibition on the import into the Union of mercury and of mixtures when planned for other uses. sets a prohibition, which shall start on 1st January 2021, on the export, import and manufacturing of a range of mercury-added products; foresees the possible adoption of Commission Implementing Decisions specifying the trade forms to be used by the Member States' competent authorities to implement Articles 3 and 4, as a follow up of Decisions that will be adopted by the Conference of the parties of the Minamata Convention. Restrictions on use and storage of mercury and mercury compounds : the proposal: prohibits the use of mercury and mercury compounds as catalyst for the production of acetaldehyde and of vinyl chloride monomer as from 1st January 2019; sets a prohibition on the manufacturing and placing on the market of mercury-added products not covered by any known use prior to the date of application of this proposal and on the implementation of manufacturing processes that did not exist prior to this date; provides that Member States where artisanal and small-scale gold mining (ASGM) activities occurs shall take steps to reduce, and where feasible eliminate, the use and emissions of mercury and mercury compounds resulting from such an activity and shall develop and implement a relevant national plan; requires that dental amalgam be used only in an encapsulated form and that dental facilities be equipped with amalgam separators to retain and collect mercury-containing amalgam residues, as from 1st January 2019. Storage and disposal of mercury waste : the proposal: provides that mercury that is no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry or generated from the cleaning of natural gas or from non-ferrous metals mining and smelting or extracted from cinnabar ore qualifies as waste that must be disposed of; the companies operating these activities shall have to provide annually to national competent authorities information regarding notably the amount of mercury stored within each installation concerned and the amount of mercury sent to temporary or permanent mercury waste storage facilities; provides that mercury waste can be temporarily or permanently stored in underground storage facilities and temporarily stored in above-ground storage facilities and specifies, for that purpose what requirements established in Council Directive 1999/31/EC for the temporary storage of mercury waste are applicable to the permanent storage of mercury waste in underground storage facilities Penalties and reports : the proposal lays down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of this proposal. It also provides for the obligation of the Member States to prepare, update and publish a report containing all relevant information on the implementation of this proposal. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

BACKGROUND: since 1990, programmes under the 'European territorial cooperation' objective, better known as 'Interreg', have supported cross-border cooperation programmes in EU border regions, including those with EFTA countries. Thousands of projects and initiatives that have helped to improve European integration have been funded. In recent decades, the European integration process has helped internal border regions to transform themselves from mainly peripheral areas into areas of growth and opportunities. However, the evidence gathered by the Commission shows that, in general, border regions generally perform less well economically than other regions within a Member State. Access to public services such as hospitals and universities is generally lower in border regions. Navigating between different administrative and legal systems is often still complex and costly. These programmes alone can hardly compensate for these differences. In its Communication of 20 September 2017 on EU border regions, the Commission highlighted ways in which the EU and its Member States can reduce the complexity, length and costs of cross-border interaction and promoted the pooling of services along internal borders. In 2015, the Luxembourg Presidency and several Member States studied the possibility of creating a new instrument to simplify cross-border projects by making it possible, on a voluntary basis and agreed by the competent authorities in charge, for the rules of one Member State to apply in the neighbouring Member State. This would apply to a specific project or action limited in time, located within a border region and initiated by local and/or regional public authorities. The Commission supports this idea and therefore proposes a voluntary mechanism to address legal obstacles in border regions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers that a voluntary mechanism to remove legal and administrative obstacles in all border regions would provide a cost-free legal framework in order to reduce the costs and time to complete certain cross-border projects. If 20% of existing legal and administrative obstacles found along internal borders were addressed, border regions would increase their GDP by 2%. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation sets up a mechanism to allow for the application in one Member State, with regard to a cross-border region, of the legal provisions from another Member State, where the application of the legal provisions of the former would constitute a legal obstacle hampering the implementation of a joint project. Characteristics of the mechanism : the mechanism shall consist of the conclusion of a European Cross-border Commitment, which is self-executing, or a European Cross-border Statement which requires a further legislative procedure in the Member State. The mechanism shall: remain voluntary : Member States may opt for the mechanism or use other effective mechanisms to resolve legal border barriers; focus on intra-EU land borders , while allowing Member States to also apply the mechanism to maritime and external borders; cover joint projects for any item of infrastructure with impact in a cross-border region or any service of general economic interest provided in a cross-border region. Member States opting for the Mechanism set up under the proposed Regulation are obliged to establish a national or, in the case of federal states, regional Cross-border Coordination Points. Procedure : the procedure for concluding a commitment or statement consists in: the preparation and submission of the initiative document, to be drafted by the ‚Äòinitiator‚Äô (for example, the public or private body responsible for initiating or both initiating and implementing a joint project or one or more local or regional authority located in a given cross-border region or exercising public power in that cross-border region; a preliminary analysis by the Member State which is requested to ‚Äòpull over the border‚Äô the legal provisions of the neighbouring Member State; the drafting of the Commitment or Statement to be concluded; and finally the conclusion of the Commitment or Statement and its signing by the competent authorities of both Member States. Implementation : the Commitment is implemented by, where relevant, amending existing administrative acts based on the ‚Äònormally‚Äô applicable law or adopting new administrative acts based on the law ‚Äòpulled over the border‚Äô. The Statement must be implemented by one or more submissions of proposals to the competent legislative body in order to amend the national law to cover the necessary derogations. In both cases, once all steps planned are implemented, the Cross-border Coordination Point must inform its counterpart in the other Member State and the EU coordination point."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: foreign direct investment (FDI) is included in the list of matters under the common commercial policy pursuant to Article 207(1) TFEU. FDI is an important source of growth, employment and innovation. It has brought significant benefits to the EU as to the rest of the world. This is why the EU wants to maintain an open investment environment. While the Union's openness to foreign direct investment will not change, it has to be accompanied by vigorous and effective policies to, on the one hand, open up other economies and ensure that everyone plays by the same rules, and, on the other hand, to protect critical European assets against investment that would be detrimental to legitimate interests of the Union or its Member States. Today, nearly half of the Member States have screening mechanisms in place. A mechanism which allows the State to monitor foreign investments in companies/sectors considered of strategic importance and to oppose them under certain conditions. However, existing screening mechanisms have differences in scope and procedure. The proposed framework shall ensure that foreign investment remains a major source of growth in the EU and at the same time contribute to protecting the EU‚Äôs core values. The proposal is fully in line with the 2015 ‚ÄòTrade for All‚Äô Communication to create a rules-based regime for trade and investment. The proposed Regulation follows up on the Commission's reflection paper of 10 May 2017 on ‚ÄòHarnessing Globalisation‚Äô highlighting the benefits and the challenges of globalisation. CONTENT: the aim of the proposed Regulation is to establish an enabling framework for the screening by the Member States and the Commission of foreign direct investments in the Union on the grounds of security or public order. It does not require Member States to adopt or maintain a screening mechanism for foreign direct investment. It sets out the basic requirements to be met by screening mechanism, such as the possibility of a judicial redress of decisions, non-discrimination between different third countries and transparency. The proposed Regulation: confirms that foreign direct investment may be screened by Member States and the Commission on the grounds of security or public order. These grounds are defined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the WTO (World Trade Organisation) Agreement and other trade and investment agreements to which the Union or its Member States are parties; establishes a cooperation mechanism between Member States and the Commission to inform each other and exchange information on foreign direct investment likely to threaten security or public order. Such cooperation should enable Member States to exchange information and, where possible, coordinate their response to foreign direct investment where appropriate; provides for the possibility for the Commission to issue an advisory opinion to the Member States concerned if it considers that a FDI may affect security or public order in relation to projects or programmes of Union interest. These include projects and programmes in the fields of research (Horizon 2020), space (Galileo), transport (trans-European transport network, TEN-T), energy (trans-European network energy, TEN-E) and telecommunications. The Commission should also be able to issue an advisory opinion in case it considers that a FDI in one Member State affects the security or public order in another Member State; obliges Member States to inform other Member States and the Commission about any foreign direct investment that is undergoing screening within the framework of their national screening mechanisms. The proposed cooperation mechanisms will allow a Member State to raise concerns as regards a foreign direct investment in another Member State and to provide comments. The Commission may also issue a non-binding opinion on such foreign direct investment; provides that Member States and the Commission may request certain information on a specific foreign direct investment on a case-by-case basis in order to be able to analyse in detail whether this investment affects or threatens to undermine security or order public; requires Member States to establish contact points within their administration which can be consulted on all matters relating to the implementation of the Regulation. In addition, the Commission intends to set up a coordination group composed of Member States‚Äô representatives and the Commission to examine issues relating to FDI into the EU as a forum for exchanging information between Member States on foreign direct investment flows and trends in this area. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on appropriations of an administrative nature is estimated at EUR 3.224 million over a 4-year period."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: interoperability is lacking in the current European electronic toll systems (EETS), which is a particular problem for cross-border traffic. At present, several ""on-board units"" on board vehicles are required to travel unhindered in different countries. The costs are estimated at EUR 334 million a year currently and are expected to fall just below EUR 300 million a year by 2025 (without further EU action). To address these issues, a Directive on the interoperability of electronic road toll systems was adopted in 2004. Some cross-border interoperability has been achieved, but in a number of countries it is still the case that only national ‚Äòon-board units‚Äô can be used to pay tolls. EETS providers face considerable barriers to entry, such as discriminatory treatment by authorities (including protection of incumbents); long and changing acceptance procedures; and technical specificities in local systems that do not comply with established standards. Another problem relates to the difficulty to identify the offender on the basis of the licence plate number when the vehicle is registered abroad. There is no legal basis at EU level for the exchange of vehicle registration data between Member States for the purpose of toll enforcement. The resulting revenue leakage for national, regional and local tolling schemes amounts to some EUR 300 million a year. In this context, the Commission considers it necessary to provide for the widespread deployment of electronic toll systems in the Member States and neighbouring countries. These systems should be interoperable and based on open and public standards, available on a non-discriminatory basis to all system suppliers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option aims to address all problems through legislation, keeping the ‚Äòmarket-based‚Äô approach taken in Decision 2009/750/EC on the definition of the European Electronic Toll Service and its technical elements. The expected benefits are as follows: for road users ‚Äì cumulated savings of EUR 370 million (net present value ‚Äì NPV) until 2025; for road network managers ‚Äì savings of EUR 48 million (NPV) until 2025; for EETS providers ‚Äì a reduction in regulatory burden linked to entering national markets and market expansion, with additional revenues of EUR 700 million a year. Overall, the net cumulated benefit of the preferred policy option (benefits minus costs) is EUR 254 million (NPV) until 2025. CONTENT: this proposal is a recast of an existing legal act (Directive 2004/52/EC). Subject matter and scope : the proposed Directive lays down the conditions necessary to ensure the interoperability of electronic road toll systems and facilitating cross-border exchange of information on the failure to pay road fees in the Union. It shall apply to the electronic collection of all types of road fees on the entire Union road network, urban and inter-urban motorways, minor and major roads and various structures such as tunnels, bridges and ferries. Technological solutions : all new electronic toll systems that require the installation or use of on-board equipment should use one or more of the technologies listed in Annex IV to the Directive to carry out electronic toll transactions. The proposal provides that on-board equipment which uses satellite positioning technology is compatible with the positioning services provided by the Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service ('EGNOS') systems and may be compatible with other satellite navigation systems. EETS on-board equipment can link to other devices installed or present in the vehicle, such as satellite navigation systems or smartphones. It also clarifies that communication between the on-board equipment and such other devices may use technologies not listed in Annex IV (for example, Bluetooth). Until 31 December 2027, EETS providers may provide users of light-duty vehicles with on-board equipment suitable for use only with the 5.8 GHz microwave technology. Procedure for the cross-border exchange of information on road-safety-related traffic offences : for the investigation of the failure to pay road fees, the Member State shall grant other Member States' national contact points access to the following national vehicle registration data, with the power to conduct automated searches. The system for exchanging information on those who fail to pay a road fee should use the same tools as the system used for exchanging information on road-safety-related traffic offenses provided for in Directive (EU) 2015/413 of the European Parliament and of the Council. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: within the single market, the free movement of goods generates around 25% of EU GDP and 75% of intra-EU trade. However, much remains to be done to achieve a deep and fair European Single Market. The principle of mutual recognition requires that a good that is lawfully marketed in one Member State should not be prohibited in another Member State, unless the latter has sound reasons for banning or restricting its sale. Mutual recognition applies to products not subject to Union harmonisation legislation or only partly covered by it, such as a wide range of consumer products (textile, footwear, childcare articles, jewellery, tableware or furniture). The evaluation on the functioning of the mutual recognition in the field of goods and Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 to facilitate mutual recognition has shown that where there are no common rules, the principle of mutual recognition is not always being applied. The majority of businesses wishing to sell products in another Member State check the applicable rules in that Member State, and, if these rules prevent them from selling the product, they don‚Äôt rely on the principle of mutual recognition but most of them adapt the product to those rules. Where businesses try to rely on the principle of mutual recognition, national authorities often deny market access to those products. Following the conclusions of the evaluation, the Commission presents an initiative whose overall objective is to achieve a fairer and deeper single market for goods through more and better mutual recognition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen consists of significant legislative changes to Regulation (EC) No 764/2008 combined with soft law to improve the functioning of mutual recognition (awareness-raising, training, exchanges of officials, etc.) The combination of these two options would increase awareness and knowledge about mutual recognition, while bringing legal certainty on the application of the principle and improving administrative cooperation among Member States. In would facilitate the placing on the market of products lawfully marketed in other Member States, by framing and streamlining the discussions on whether or not the product can enter the market on the basis of mutual recognition and by reducing the risk to see market access denied. A study done for the European Parliament tried to estimate the magnitude of the impact that non-tariff barriers on trade have on the internal market. It concluded that a reduction of such non-tariff barriers to trade could lead to an increase in intra-EU trade of more than EUR 100 billion per year. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules and procedures concerning the application by Member States of the principle of mutual recognition, in individual cases, in relation to goods lawfully marketed in another Member State in the context of the principle of mutual recognition. It shall replace Regulation (EC) No 764/2008. In concrete terms, the proposal: clarifies the scope of mutual recognition , by clearly defining when it is applicable, will increase legal certainty for businesses and national authorities as to when the mutual recognition principle can be used; provides for a mutual recognition declaration, to be used on a voluntary basis by economic operators in order to facilitate the demonstration that a product has been lawfully marketed in another Member State. It sets out the conditions to be met by such declaration, and clarifies that it can be provided online; establishes the procedure to be followed by competent authorities of Member States when assessing if goods lawfully marketed in another Member State can be marketed on their territory on the basis of the mutual recognition principle; contains requirements addressing the temporary suspension of goods lawfully marketed in another Member State, in case such goods pose serious risks on health and safety or run contrary to public morality or public security; provides for a mutual recognition problem solving mechanism allowing economic operators to challenge an administrative decision denying or restricting market access by referring it first to the SOLVIT network. Such administrative decision shall be subject to an assessment by the Commission at the request of the relevant SOLVIT centre; sets the framework for administrative cooperation among competent authorities; provides for the Union to be able to finance awareness raising, training, exchange of officials and data collection in order to strengthen collaboration and trust between national authorities. The latter may nevertheless continue to take into account legitimate public interests. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal requires the mobilisation of human and administrative resources as well as operational appropriations. The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 2.710 million up to the year 2020 inclusive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in December 2015, the European Commission presented a Green Paper to consult on the potential of a more integrated market for retail financial services, and the actions needed to achieve this goal. Based on the feedback received from stakeholders and the European Parliament's report on the Green Paper, the Commission published in March 2017 an action plan setting out a strategy to strengthen the Single Market for consumer financial services. Cross-border payments in euro from non-euro area Member States account for a very large part of all cross-border payments from non-euro area Member States. The charges for those specific cross-border payments remain high. At present, for example a citizen or company in Bulgaria4 making a cross-border transfer of EUR 500 to Finland may have to pay up to EUR 24 in fees, whereas a person transferring the same amount to Finland from France would pay nothing, or almost nothing. Restrictions and excessive costs for cross-border payments prevent the completion of the Single Market. They perpetuate the existence of two categories of payment service users in the Union: on the one hand payment service users, the vast majority of which benefit from the single euro payments area ('SEPA'), and on the other hand, payment service users that pay high costs for their cross-border payments in euro. In order to facilitate the functioning of the Single Market, the Commission considers it necessary to ensure that charges for cross-border payments in euro within the Union are aligned with charges for domestic payments made in the official currency of a Member State. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the four options analysed, the option chosen is the one proposing to align fees for cross-border intra-EU payments in euro with fees for domestic transactions in the national currency of a Member State. As a result of the amendments contained in this proposal, the citizen or company transferring euros from Bulgaria would also pay nothing ‚Äî or almost nothing ‚Äî in this situation. This person or company would pay the same fees for a transfer in euros to Finland that they would pay for a domestic transfer in levs within Bulgaria. CONTENT: under the proposed amendment to Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the price of a cross-border payment transaction in euro within the European Union should not be different from that of domestic transactions within a Member State conducted in the national currency of that Member State. The proposal does not concern cross-border transactions denominated in currencies other than the euro. The amendments to Regulation 924/2009 contained in the proposal: establish the principle that payment service providers must align fees for cross-border payments in euro with those for corresponding domestic payments in the national currency of the payment service user‚Äôs Member State also for Member States which do not have the euro as their national currency; define additional transparency requirements relating to currency conversion practices. Currently, consumers are generally not informed of the cost of a transaction that involves currency conversion. The proposal therefore provides that consumers should be fully informed of the amount of exchange charges before making such a payment (be it a cash withdrawal at an ATM or a card payment at a point of sale). The European Banking Authority ('EBA') shall develop draft regulatory technical standards specifying how payment service providers shall ensure transparency and price comparability of different currency conversion service options, where those are available, to payment service users."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Consequently, unless another date is established in a withdrawal agreement, or the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously establishes another date, Union law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019. The United Kingdom will then become a third country. CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council adapting Directive 2012/27/EU [as amended by Directive 2018/XXX/EU] on energy efficiency and the Regulation (EU) 2018/XXX [Governance of the Energy Union] is necessitated by the upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In this regard, it is necessary to technically adapt the projected energy consumption figures for the European Union in 2030 to reflect the Union of 27 Member States. Projections made for the at least 32.5 % Union headline target show that primary energy consumption should equal 1 273 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) and 956 Mtoe of final energy consumption in 2030 for the Union of 28 Member States. The equivalent projections for the EU 27 excluding the United Kingdom show that primary energy consumption should equal 1 128 Mtoe and final energy consumption should equal 846 Mtoe in 2030. This requires the adaptation of the figures for energy consumption levels in 2030. Lastly, Member States shall take into account the projections for the EU27 when notifying the Commission of national indicative energy efficiency contributions towards the EU target for 2030 as part of their integrated national energy and climate plans."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of the Cook Islands with a view to concluding a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and an Implementation Protocol thereto between the European Union and the Cook Islands. Following these negotiations, a new Agreement and Protocol were initialled on 21 October 2015. They cover a period of eight years and four years respectively from the date of their provisional application, i.e. from the date of their signature. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt by Decision the conclusion of this new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands and the Implementation Protocol Agreement. The new Agreement will provide for a framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and the Cook Islands. This Agreement establishes the principles, rules and procedures governing: The main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Cook Islands fishing zone, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and respecting the conservation and management measures of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) where applicable within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Cook Islands to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Cook Islands‚Äô fishing zone, in the interests of both parties. The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities for 4 tuna seiners to fish for highly migratory species as listed in Annex 1 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union‚Äôs space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‚ÄòGOVSATCOM‚Äô. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union‚Äôs role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only with Parliament‚Äôs approval. BACKGROUND: the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Community on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety entered into force on 1 May 2011. The purpose of the Agreement is to ensure the continuation of the high level of cooperation and harmonisation between the United States and the European Union in the fields within the scope of the Agreement. The initial scope of the Agreement, covers: (i) airworthiness approvals and monitoring of civil aeronautical products; (ii) environmental testing and approvals of civil aeronautical products; and (iii) approvals and monitoring of maintenance facilities. In the course of the implementation of the Agreement, notably through discussions in the Bilateral Oversight Board established under the Agreement, the United States' Federal Aviation Administration ('the FAA') and the Commission have found that there is a mutual desire to enhance the possibilities for further aviation safety cooperation beyond the current provisions of the Agreement, as a priority in the pilot licensing and training field. On 25 September 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate an amendment to the Agreement, so as to provide for additional areas of cooperation. The agreement amending the Agreement was signed on behalf of the Union and should now be approved. CONTENT: the Commission requests that the Council approve, on behalf of the EU, the Amendment 1 to the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Community on cooperation in the regulation of civil aviation safety. The Amendment 1 to the Agreement extends the areas of cooperation between the Parties, where reciprocal acceptance of approvals and findings of compliance can apply, so as to allow for an optimised resource utilisation and commensurate cost savings while maintaining a high degree of safety in air transport. Following Amendment No 1 of the Agreement, the cooperation envisaged between the Parties now covers the following areas: With regards to the scope of application of the Agreement, the Parties will: Until entry into force of Amendment No 1, the Parties agree to apply the Agreement provisionally from the date of its signature."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening-up of certain Union programmes and agencies to the participation of ENP partner countries represents one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union‚Äôs neighbourhood. The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in its Communication of December 2006 ‚Äòon the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes‚Äô. The Council endorsed this approach in its conclusions of 5 March 2007. On 18 June 2007, the Council issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. In February 2013, Algeria expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the protocol negotiated with Algeria is attached to this proposal. It is now necessary to conclude this Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Algeria on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes. It contains standard clauses that are intended to be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with which such protocols are concluded. Objective: the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which gives access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to the Union programmes. This framework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of Algeria‚Äôs participation. The signing and provisional application of the Protocol therefore does not entail the exercise of the powers under the various sectoral policies pursued by the programmes which are exercised when establishing the programmes."

The measures taken so far have not effectively solved the main problems of the fishery, these being: Due to deep-sea stocks' high vulnerability to fishing, stock depletion can occur within a short period of time, and recovery might take very long or fail. The stocks' biological state is largely unknown. Some are considered depleted, others have started to stabilise at low levels of exploitation. In general the fisheries are not sustainable. A new regulation is required in order to deal with these problems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of impacts resulting from different policy choices focussed on five options. Three of these were not considered further because they were considered not representing meaningful management approaches, with disadvantages largely outweighing advantages, namely: (i) to continue the current regime amending it only by needed updates; (ii) to ban fishing for deep-sea species altogether, and (iii) to scale the regime down to being a tool for transposing measures adopted in NEAFC and applying those measures also in Union waters. The two options with relative advantage were: (iv) to phase out the most harmful fishing gears targeting deep-sea species, or (v) to introduce in Union waters management standards that were developed for bottom fishing on the High Sea. Option (iv) was retained as being a more effective and simpler instrument. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes a framework Regulation for exercising fishing activity targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantics, comprising Union waters including outermost regions of Spain and Portugal, and international waters. The objectives of this Regulation are the following: ¬∑  to ensure the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea species while minimising the impact of deep-sea fishing activities on the marine environment; ¬∑  to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats for these purposes; ¬∑  to implement technical measures on fisheries management recommended by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Ensure sustainable exploitation : the general objective of the proposal is to ensure as much as possible the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea stocks while reducing the environmental impact of these fisheries, and to improve the information base for scientific assessment. As long as data and method have not achieved the required level allowing MSY-based management, the fisheries have to be managed according to the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Protect marine ecosystems : in order to reduce the destructive impact on the marine ecosystem, the use of bottom trawls should be phased out in this fishery, as they are most harmful to vulnerable marine ecosystems and have shown high levels of undesired catch of deep-sea species. The transitional restrictions on bottom-set gillnets in fisheries below 600m depth and in the depth-range 200-600m should be accompanied by a prohibition to target deep-sea species. Simplifying the management system for these stocks : the proposal also considers the opportunity to simplify the management system for these stocks, currently subject to a double instrument: catch limitations and capacity/effort limitation. Where this duplication is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, proposals are made to regulate the concerned fisheries with only one management instrument. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data is a fundamental right. Moreover, in Article 16(2) TFEU, the Lisbon Treaty introduced a specific legal basis for adopting rules on the protection of personal data. Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides natural persons with legally enforceable rights, specifies the data processing obligations of controllers within the Community institutions and bodies, and creates an independent supervisory authority, the European Data Protection Supervisor, responsible for monitoring the processing of personal data by the Union institutions and bodies. However, it does not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity of Union institutions and bodies which fall outside the scope of Union law. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (General Data Protection Regulation) and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council were adopted on 27 April 2016. While the Regulation lays down general rules to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data within the Union, the Directive lays down the specific rules to protect natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data and to ensure the free movement of personal data within the Union in the fields of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and police cooperation. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 stresses the need for the necessary adaptations of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 in order to provide a strong and coherent data protection framework in the Union and to allow application at the same time as Regulation (EU) 2016/679. It is in the interest of a coherent approach to personal data protection throughout the Union, and of the free movement of personal data within the Union, to align as far as possible the data protection rules for Union institutions and bodies with the data protection rules adopted for the public sector in the Member States. CONTENT: in order to align the existing rules, which date back to 2001, with the newer and more stringent rules set out by the General Data Protection Regulation of 2016, the Commission has proposed the following: Objective : this proposed Regulation has a two-fold objective: to protect the fundamental right to data protection and to guarantee the free flow of personal data throughout the Union; to provide for the main tasks of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). Scope : the proposal shall apply to the processing of personal data, by automated means or otherwise, by all Union institutions and bodies insofar as such processing is carried out in the exercise of activities all or part of which fall within the scope of Union law. The material scope of this Regulation is technologically neutral. The protection of personal data applies to the processing of personal data by automated means, as well as to manual processing if the personal data are contained or are intended to be contained in a filing system. Levels of protection : new principles of transparency and of integrity and confidentiality have been incorporated into the new text. Further conditions for the lawfulness of the processing of personal data of children in relation to information society services offered directly to them. It sets 13 years as the child's minimum age for valid consent. New rules are provided for a specific level of protection on the transmission of personal data to recipients, other than Union institutions and bodies. The proposal clarifies that, where it is the controller initiating the transmission, it should demonstrate necessity and proportionality of the transmission. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade-union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. Data controller‚Äôs obligations : the proposal specifies the controller's information obligations towards the data subject where personal data are collected from the data subject, providing information to the data subject, including on the storage period, the right to lodge a complaint and in relation to international transfers. Personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union law. This could apply for example in proceedings by services competent for social security or health matters. Further modalities are provided to facilitate the exercise of the data subject's rights under this Regulation, including mechanisms to request and, if applicable, obtain, free of charge, in particular, access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and the exercise of the right to object. Obligations for EU institutions : the proposal provides for an obligation for Union institutions and bodies to inform the EDPS when drawing up administrative measures and internal rules relating to the processing of personal data. It also provides for an obligation for the Commission to consult the EDPS following the adoption of proposals for a legislative act and of recommendations or proposals to the Council and when preparing delegated acts or implementing acts that have an impact on the protection of individuals‚Äô rights and freedoms with regard to the processing of personal data. Provisions are also laid down concerning the transfer of personal data to third countries or international organisations. EDPS : specific provisions are laid down as regards the appointment of the EDPS by the European Parliament and the Council, the duration of its term of office: five years; the general conditions governing the performance of duties of the EDPS and his or her staff and the financial resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States ‚Äì with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom ‚Äì and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU‚Äôs common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period. Kosovo is currently listed in Annex I, Part 2 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , i.e. among those entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as states by at least one Member State. Persons from those entities are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. Since launching the visa dialogue in January 2012, the Commission has presented regular reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on its assessment of Kosovo‚Äôs fulfilment of the requirements of the roadmap which identified all the legislation and other measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. In its last report, the Commission set out recommendations corresponding to outstanding requirements of the visa roadmap, including four key priorities. It noted the border/boundary delineation agreement with Montenegro should be ratified by Kosovo before visa free status is granted to persons from Kosovo. In its latest report, the Commission observed that Kosovo had taken important steps towards fulfilling the requirement of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and fulfilled sufficient elements of building up its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Based on this assessment and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo, the Commission confirms that Kosovo has met the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap on the understanding that by the day of the adoption of this proposal by the European Parliament and the Council, Kosovo will have ratified the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. CONTENT: taking account of all the criteria which should be considered when determining on a case-by-case basis the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014), the Commission has decided to present a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Kosovo from Annex I, Part 2 (visa-required list) to Annex II, Part 4 (visa-free list). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa exemption will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents (Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004). Territorial provisions : the proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application. The amended Regulation will be directly applicable from the date of its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary. The Commission will continue to actively monitor Kosovo‚Äôs process of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and the development of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. CONTENT: since 1996, the Commission has been striving to consolidate the European Common Aviation Area or ECAA. To recall, the purpose of the ECAA is to open up markets between Europe and its neighbours and to offer ECAA signatories the benefits of an internal market in the field of aviation. In other words, the ECAA is a multi-lateral agreement offering full market opening in terms of access, capacity, fares and the freedom of establishment without nationality clauses as well as an alignment with Community legislation on safety, security and air-traffic management matters. Initial negotiations from 1996 onwards focused on the then ten applicant countries. Following their accession in May 2004, the Commission‚Äôs focus has shifted towards the Balkan region. The text of the multilateral agreement has been accepted by: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the European Community, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, Romania and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. Following extensive negotiations these countries have agreed to align their national aviation legislation with that of the EU‚Äôs. The Commission suggests that this development acts as a major step forward. In future air transport will play a key role in both the economic and political integration of Europe. Upon adoption of the proposed Council Decisions the existing bilateral air service agreements between the Member States and the ECAA partners will, to a large extent, cease to exist and be substituted by one single Community Agreement. In addition, the the text of the Agreement has been simplified. For instance, competition issues will henceforth be dealt with through the Stabilisation and Association Process. In terms of its structure, a common ‚Äúmultilateral main text‚Äù forms the basis of the ECAA. This text will be obligatory to all signatories. A series of Protocols have been added which accommodating the specific need of each country, including appropriate transitional arrangements. Lastly, an Annex lists all of the EU‚Äôs aviation acts applicable within the ECAA."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current design of the residence permit was adopted in 1997. Back in 2009, Member States considered that more sophisticated forgeries meant it was necessary to work on a new design for residence permits and decided to introduce more modern security features to improve the security features of residence permits. Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 380/2008, lays down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals. During the discussions, it became clear that Member States were not in favour of a completely harmonised document. They insisted on maintaining the list of ‚Äòupdated‚Äô additional security features, which could be added to a common ‚Äòuniform‚Äô format if desired. They did not wish to change their systems but preferred to continue with a common ‚Äòuniform‚Äô card with an improved level of security and an updated list of optional (national) security features. ‚ÄòUniformity‚Äô only meant having a uniform design and some standard security features, to which optional national security features could be added. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a new common design for residence permits for third-country nationals with more modern security features in order to render the residence permits more secure and prevent forgery. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to replace the Annex to Regulation (EC) 1030/2002 by a new technical Annex containing the image and the general description of the new residence permit. Transitional period and implementation : to allow existing stocks to be used up, provision is made for a transitional period of six months during which Member States can still use the old residence permits. It is also provided that Member States must introduce the new residence permits nine months after the Commission adopts an implementing decision on the supplementary technical specifications."

BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary impact shall be exclusively limited to the revenue side. The amounts are estimated at EUR 1.3 million per year. The method used for calculation of revenues: unit value of average similar trade imports for years 2012-2014 multiplied by the new tariff rate quotas volumes multiplied by the in-quota rate duty (20%) minus 25% deduction for collection costs. For subsequent years, the unit value has been considered as constant."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: high quality, comparable, up-to-date, reliable and harmonised information on natural gas and electricity prices charged to final customers are needed in order to draft Energy Union policy and monitor the Member States‚Äô energy markets. Up to the present date, Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has provided a common framework for producing, transmitting and disseminating comparable statistics on the natural gas and electricity retail prices charged to industrial customers in the Union. National authorities collect price data for household customers on the basis of a voluntary agreement. The growing complexity of the internal energy market make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable and up-to-date price data for natural gas and electricity in the absence of legally binding obligations to provide such data, in particular for the household sector. In order to guarantee the reporting of high quality price data for the household sector and for the non-household sector, the Commission considered that the collection of both types of data should be covered by a legal act. The European Commission adopted on 25 February 2015 the Energy Union Package. One of the actions of the Energy Union Package under the chapter of the internal energy market defines an analysis of energy prices and costs to be carried out in 2016 and every 2 years thereafter. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to establish a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of comparable European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the EU. It repeals Directive 2008/92/EC. While applying the principle of maintaining a reduced burden on respondents and of administrative simplification, Member States shall compile data on natural gas and electricity prices and their sub-components on network costs and taxes, levies, fees and charges as referred to in Annexes I and II and on consumption volumes. The system of consumption bands used by the Commission (Eurostat) in its price publications should ensure the transparency of the market and the broad dissemination of non-confidential price data and should enable the calculation of European aggregates. Detailed data on the breakdown of consumption bands and their respective market shares are an essential part of natural gas and electricity price statistics. Members States should regularly prepare quality reports and assessments of the quality of the price data. Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers to the Commission (Eurostat) if the consumption of natural gas in the household sector is below a threshold of 1 % of national total energy consumption in the household sector. Based on a justified request from a Member State, the Commission may grant derogations to Member States in relation to those specific obligations for which the application of this Regulation to the national statistical system of a Member State requires major adaptations and is likely to lead to a significant additional burden on respondents. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014.

Under Regulation (EU) No 515/2014, the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the Internal Security Fund ('the ISF ‚ÄìBorders and Visa'). This Fund aims to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf.

This is the purpose of this Agreement with Iceland. CONTENT: with this proposed Council decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The aim of the draft Agreement with Iceland is to establish the arrangements for the participation of Iceland in the ISF ‚Äì Borders and Visa and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. Protection of the EU‚Äôs financial interests: as regards budgetary and financial controls, the Member States are subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)), derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. These obligations must be extended to the associated country by means of the draft Agreement. In order to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities, Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 provides that cooperation agreements with third countries will expressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot controls and inspections. Territorial provisions: Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application. It will decide, within six months after the Council has adopted the proposal, whether it will implement the proposed Decision into its national law.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF ‚Äì Borders and Visa) for the period 2014-2020, as well as Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management which became applicable as of 1 January 2014. The purpose of the ISF ‚Äì Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors.

CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Switzerland on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The negotiations were held jointly with all associated countries. Two rounds of negotiations took place. The final text of the draft Agreement with Switzerland was initialled on 21 April 2017. The draft Agreement provides for the amount of Switzerland's annual financial contribution to the budget of the ISF - Borders and Visa, calculated in accordance with its GDP as a percentage of the GDP of all States participating in the ISF. It specifies the annual payments. In addition, it foresees the modalities for the designation of the Responsible Authority and for the annual reporting system. The Agreement also contains provisions aiming to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities as well as to ensure compliance with the provisions relevant for the financial management and control which are laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') and in Union law based on the TFEU. This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part. Denmark will decide within six months after the Council has adopted this proposal whether it will implement the proposed decision in its national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the process leading to the PRIMA Joint Programme started with the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Science, Technology and Innovation in Barcelona in 2012. The aim is to strengthen Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in R&I as part of the broader objectives of the Union‚Äôs external policy with regard to the Southern Neighbourhood. On 23 December 2014, a group of 19 countries of the Mediterranean Area submitted to the Commission a proposal for a Joint Programme initiative 'Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area' (PRIMA). Among these countries, 14 countries have agreed to jointly undertake the PRIMA initiative by committing financial contributions: Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal and Spain, Member States of the Union; Israel and Tunisia, third countries associated to Horizon 2020; Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco (third countries not associated to Horizon 2020). With 180 million people who are considered 'water poor' , the Mediterranean area is generally characterised by high levels of hydric stress. Climate change is increasingly causing severe water shortages in the area, with major impacts on agriculture. Such shortages result in decreasing and irregular crop yields, putting additional pressure on natural resources and on the capacity to provide clean water and affordable food for the region‚Äôs inhabitants. The programme‚Äôs strategic objective is to develop the common innovative solutions for water provision and food systems that the Mediterranean region urgently needs. The programme is in line with the Communication from the Commission on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option withheld is Option 2: PRIMA Joint Programme based on Article 185 TFEU which enables the EU to make provisions for its participation in research and development programmes run by several Member States, including its participation in the structures created for the implementation of those programmes. Previous and ongoing Article 185 TFEU initiatives show that such an initiative is likely to have a high leverage effect on national public funds in a stable, long-term and integrated manner. CONTENT: the draft decision provides for the participation of the EU in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area ('PRIMA') jointly undertaken by Cyprus, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Spain and Tunisia. Egypt, Lebanon and Morocco shall become Participating States subject to the conclusion of international agreements with the Union setting out the terms and conditions of their participation in PRIMA. Any Member State and any country associated to Horizon 2020 may participate in PRIMA provided they contribute to its financing. Objectives : the general objective of PRIMA is to develop the fully piloted and demonstrated common innovative solutions for water provision and food systems in the Mediterranean region, to make them more climate resilient, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable, and to contribute to solving nutrition, health, well-being and migration problems upstream. In order to contribute to the general objective, PRIMA shall fulfil the following specific objectives: the formulation of a stable, long-term, common strategic agenda in the area of water provision and food systems; the orientation of all national R&I programmes towards the implementation of the strategic agenda; the structural involvement of all relevant public and private sector actors in implementing the strategic agenda by pooling knowledge and financial resources to achieve the necessary critical mass; the strengthening of funding and of the implementation capabilities of all actors involved. Implementation : in order to ensure the joint implementation of PRIMA, an implementation structure should be set up ('PRIMA-IS'). The PRIMA-IS should be the recipient of the Union‚Äôs financial contribution and it should ensure the efficient implementation of PRIMA. PRIMA activities should be in line with the objectives and research and innovation priorities of Horizon 2020 and with the general principles and conditions laid down in the Regulation establishing the 2020 Horizon framework programme. In order to achieve the objectives of PRIMA, the PRIMA-IS should provide financial support mainly in the form of grants to participants in actions funded by the PRIMAIS. Those actions should be selected following open and competitive calls for proposals under the responsibility of the PRIMA-IS. The PRIMA Annual Work Plans (AWP), which is subject to the approval of the Commission, will ensure consistency and coordination between all activities and their orientation towards the achievement of the operational, specific and general objectives of PRIMA. The proposal contains provisions on the monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements of the initiative. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU contribution shall be up to EUR 200 million (in current prices) including the EFTA contribution. The EU contribution shall be made as part of the implementation of Horizon 2020. The Participating States shall make or arrange for their national funding bodies to make financial or in kind contributions of at least EUR 200 000 000 during the period from the date of entry into force of this Decision until 31 December 2028."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the recent earthquakes in Italy have had a devastating effect on the people living in the region. Large scale reconstruction works will be required, notably to restore the cultural heritage of the affected areas. Europe needs to be able to quickly provide additional, effective support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to Member States and regions hit by major or regional natural disasters, complementing the means available under the European Union Solidarity Fund. In order to provide such additional assistance to Member States affected by natural disasters, the Commission proposes to introduce the possibility of a separate priority axis for reconstruction operations supported by the ERDF within an operational programme. CONTENT: it is proposed to introduce an additional paragraph in Article 120 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to provide for the creation of a separate priority axis with a co-financing rate of up to 100% to support, under ERDF investment priorities, operations selected by managing authorities in response to major or regional disasters. The operations that may be cofinanced under this separate priority axis are those linked to reconstruction in response to major or regional natural disasters as defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund. Starting date of eligibility of expenditure : for operations under this separate priority axis, a derogation to the rule concerning the starting date of eligibility of expenditure as a result of an amendment of a programme is proposed. This would ensure that following the amendment of the programme expenditure incurred as from the date of the disaster can be declared for reimbursement. Covering expenses : a provision has also been included to cover the case of expenditure declared for measures taken by Member State authorities directly after the disaster occurred, and before the operational programme is amended, and reimbursed at the existing co-financing rate. The higher co-financing rate would then be applied through the necessary adjustments to the next payment application and, where appropriate, to the next accounts, once the programme has been amended to include the separate priority axis. Reporting arrangements : the implementation of the measure will be monitored and reported upon in the framework of the general reporting mechanisms established in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. It remains within the limits of the overall allocation for the period 2014-2020 and is therefore budgetary neutral. The increased co-financing rate up to 100% will lead to a partial frontloading of payments, followed by lower payments at a later stage as the overall envelope is unchanged."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: energy labelling enables customers to obtain accurate, relevant and comparable information on the energy efficiency and consumption of energy related products wherever they are in the Union allowing them to take informed cost-effective and environmentally friendly purchasing decisions that are both good for the environment and save money. On 25 February 2015, the Commission announced in its Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union a review of Directive 2010/30/EU on the Energy Labelling Directive in order to further exploit the potential of energy efficiency for the moderation of energy demand and consequent reduction of the energy dependency of the European Union. Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council was evaluated for its effectiveness. The evaluation identified the need to update the Energy Labelling framework to improve its effectiveness. For 2030 the European Council set in October 2014 an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency which will be reviewed by 2020, having in mind an EU level of 30%. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looks at both a number of issues with the current Directive and some specific items concerning the Ecodesign Directive. The two most important issues concerning the Energy Labelling Directive were: reduced effectiveness of the energy label and non-compliance due to weak enforcement; long rulemaking processes, leading to outdated technical and preparatory work. The final option chosen was to: (i) improve the existing regulatory framework on energy labelling, (ii) require labelled products to be registered in a new database,(iii) improve the legal structure by changing the current Energy Labelling Directive to a Regulation, to align it with the market surveillance regulation, and to, (iv) fund EU joint market surveillance actions. CONTENT: this proposal follows up on the Energy Union Framework Strategy and intends to replace Directive 2010/30/EU on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products by a Regulation. In the proposal, the objectives and main principles of the current Energy Labelling Directive are retained but the proposal clarifies, strengthens and extends the scope of the current Directive's provisions by: (1) Updating the label and allowing for rescaling : the success of energy labelling means that the label is running into its limits. Although A+ to A+++ energy efficiency classes were added in 2010, for some product groups, all models are already in those new classes and there are no longer any models in the lower classes. There is a systematic need to 'rescale' products and to go back to the original A to G energy label scale, which studies suggest is the one best understood by consumers. Although the current Directive allows for the possible reclassification of products through specific delegated acts, the current proposal deals with the need to rescale the energy labels in a much more systematic manner. It also makes clear the obligations on suppliers and dealers during the rescaling and replacement phase. The existing labels will be reviewed by the Commission within five years of the entry into force of the Regulation, with a view to rescaling them. The delegated act would contain a specific date by which the 'old' labels would have to be replaced with the rescaled label (the ""replacement date""). During a transitional period, dealers would be required to replace the old label with the new one on all products on display in shops . They would have one week to replace all labels with the new ones. Member States would be required to run promotional information campaigns to inform consumers of the rescaling exercise. (2) Creating a database of products covered by energy labelling obligations : overall non-compliance in the market is estimated at 20%, leading to some 10% of envisaged energy savings being lost. The new product registration database: (i) will allow market surveillance authorities much quicker access to the necessary information; (ii) will provide up-to-date market data and energy efficiency information which will accelerate the preparatory/review studies and subsequent regulatory process. The proposal also updates the Directive's requirements in terms of providing for electronic supply of labels or for suppliers to make them available on their websites. The administrative burden for registering products is estimated at EUR 1.5 million per year for the entire industry; about 0.5 eurocent per product sold. (3) Making clearer the obligations of the various parties: the proposal regroups the respective obligations on Member States, suppliers and dealers in order to make these more coherent and simpler. The replacement of the Directive with a Regulation means less administrative burden for Member States and directly applicable requirements for suppliers and dealers which will ensure a complete harmonisation across the EU. (4) Improving the link between energy labelling and measurement standards : the proposal makes clear that a product which complies with the measurement and calculation methods set out in the relevant harmonised standard will be presumed to comply with the relevant provisions of the applicable delegated act. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this initiative does not require additional EU budgetary resources. The costs concern: setting up a products database (1.500.000 EUR in 2016 and 150.000 EUR yearly maintenance cost in subsequent years); consumer understanding studies for labels for specific product groups (300.000 EUR per year from 2017). These are financed through reprioritisation of existing budget for the implementation of the policy on energy efficiency of products. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 provides for ‚ÄòUnion General export authorisations‚Äô which facilitate controls on low-risk exports of dual-use items to certain third countries. Currently, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, including Liechtenstein, and the United States of America are covered by Union General export authorisation No. EU001. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, all EU legislation on the import and export of goods shall apply to goods moving between the EU and the United Kingdom. Considering that the United Kingdom is an important destination for dual-use items produced in the Union, it is appropriate to add the United Kingdom to the list of destinations covered by the Union General export authorisations No. EU001 in order to ensure a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union, to promote a level playing field for Union exporters and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden, while protecting Union and international security. The Commission recalls that the United Kingdom is a party to relevant international treaties and a member of international non-proliferation regimes and that it maintains full compliance with related obligations and commitments, and applies proportionate and adequate controls to effectively address considerations about intended end use and the risk of diversion consistent with the provisions. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 aims to add the United Kingdom to the list of destinations covered by the Union General export authorisation for dual-use items only in a situation where no withdrawal agreement is concluded with the United Kingdom. Given the urgency entailed by the circumstances of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, it is necessary to allow for a prompt application of the provisions provided for in this Regulation, i.e. on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The withdrawal shall occur during the programming period 2014-2020 in which the United Kingdom is participating in fifteen programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal ('cooperation programmes'). Two of those programmes are programmes involving Northern Ireland and supporting peace and reconciliation and North-South cooperation under the ‚ÄòGood Friday Agreement‚Äô that the Union intends to continue even if the United Kingdom withdraws from the Union without a withdrawal agreement having entered into force by the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Erasmus+ programme supports actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport. Every year, it provides nearly 800 000 people the opportunity to benefit from learning or training abroad. Mobility activities can last up to 12 months. The Commission estimates that by the time the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland withdraws from the European Union, there will be almost 14 000 learners from EU-27 post-Brexit (students and trainees in higher education and vocational education and training, young learners, educational staff) in the United Kingdom and some 7 000 learners from the United Kingdom within EU-27 post-Brexit. In the absence of an agreement, the current participants would not be able to complete their Erasmus+ semester, and may no longer benefit from scholarships. Many students would lose their university credits and be forced to repeat their semester or academic year, which would have a disruptive effect both on the students themselves and on their home and host institutions. Urgent measures are needed to avoid disruption of mobility activities for education and training purposes under Erasmus+ in which the United Kingdom participates at the time of its withdrawal from the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation ensures that, in the absence of a withdrawal agreement, young people from the European Union and the United Kingdom participating in the Erasmus+ programme as of 30 March 2019 shall be able to complete their stay without interruption, complete their studies and continue to receive the corresponding funding or grants. For the purposes of the continuation of financing of ongoing learning mobility activities from the Union budget, the Commission and the United Kingdom should agree to allow the exercise of controls and audits of the respective activities. If the necessary controls and audits cannot be carried out, this should be considered a serious deficiency in the management and control system. This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Union. For that purpose, a system of certificates has been established for various aviation activities, in order to achieve the required safety levels and to enable the necessary verifications and the mutual acceptance of certificates issued. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement affects in particular the validity of certificates and licenses originating from the United Kingdom issued under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. The Commission proposes therefore to set up a temporary mechanism, to extend the validity of certain aviation safety certificates, in order to allow the operators concerned and the Agency sufficient time to issue the necessary certificates under Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking account of the United Kingdom's status as a third country. CONTENT: the proposal aims to put in place a mechanism to temporarily extend (for 9 months) the validity of certain aviation safety certificates in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. It would thus allow post-Brexit EU-27 manufacturers to continue their production and operators to continue to use these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. This Regulation shall apply to the certificates listed in the Annex to this Regulation, which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by any of the following: - the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom as set out in Section 1 of the Annex; - natural or legal persons certified by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom as set out in Section 2 of the Annex.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council can adopt the act only if the European Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND : Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 established the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, (eu-LISA), in order to ensure the operational management of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the VISA Information System (VIS) and Eurodac and potentially of the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. Since 29 December 2017 and the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2017/2226, the Agency became responsible for the development and operational management of the Entry/Exit System (EES). The participation of associate countries in the Agency's work is a necessary step having regard to their association to the Schengen acquis and to Dublin and Eurodac-related measures and to their participation in the large-scale IT systems operated by the Agency. On 24 July 2012, the Commission received the Council authorisation to open negotiations with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on an arrangement on the modalities of these countries' participation in the Agency. The final text of the draft arrangement was initialled on 15 June 2018. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council conclude the Arrangement between the European Union and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein on the participation of those States in the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The draft arrangement provides for: The draft arrangement also sets out: Lastly, the draft arrangement contains provisions on combatting, dispute settlement, entry into force and validity and termination.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this revised draft Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council takes account of the Commission's opinion on the draft amendments to Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, presented by the Court of Justice on 26 March 2018. This request by the Court of Justice seeks to amend Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union follows on from its report of 14 December 2017 to the European Parliament and the Council on the possibility of certain changes to the distribution of jurisdiction between the Court of Justice and the General Court with regard to preliminary rulings. In its report, the Court of Justice considered that there was no need, at this stage, to propose amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union with a view to transferring to the General Court part of the jurisdiction it exercises in preliminary rulings. The Court of Justice and General Court brought to light the fact that, when adjudicating on an action for annulment brought by a Member State against an act of the Commission relating to a failure properly to comply with a judgment delivered by the Court of Justice under Article 260(2) or (3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the General Court may encounter serious difficulties where the Commission and the Member State concerned disagree on the adequacy of the measures adopted by that State to comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice. Many appeals are brought in cases which have already been considered twice, initially by an independent administrative authority, then by the General Court, and that many of those appeals are dismissed by the Court of Justice because they are patently unfounded, or on the ground that they are manifestly inadmissible. In order to enable the Court of Justice to concentrate on the cases that require its full attention, it is necessary to introduce, for appeals relating to such cases, a mechanism whereby the Court determines whether an appeal should be allowed to proceed. In the light of the constant increase in the number of cases brought before the Court of Justice, it is necessary, at this stage, to prioritise the establishment of the procedure mentioned above whereby the Court of Justice decides whether an appeal should be allowed to proceed. The component of the request made by the Court of Justice on 26 March 2018 that relates to the partial transfer to the General Court of infringement proceedings should be examined at a later stage, after the report on the functioning of the General Court provided for in Regulation 2015/2422 of the European Parliament and of the Council. CONTENT: in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 281 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and paragraph 1 of Article 106a of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community, the draft amendments to Protocol 3 submitted by the Court of Justice to the European Parliament and the Council concern: a transfer to the Court of jurisdiction to adjudicate in actions for annulment lodged by Member States against Commission decisions relating to a failure properly to comply with a judgment delivered by the Court under Article 260(2) and (3) TFEU. All litigation linked to a failure of a Member State to fulfil its obligations to which a financial penalty should be reserved exclusively to the Court of Justice, including challenges that may be made following a Member State being ordered to pay a lump sum or a penalty payment; establishing an initial admission mechanism for certain appeals before the Court of Justice only if they meet certain criteria : for example, a n appeal brought against a decision of the General Court concerning a decision of a board of appeal of the European Union Intellectual Property Office, the Community Plant Variety Office, the European Chemicals Agency or the European Aviation Safety Agency shall not proceed unless the Court of Justice first decides that it should be allowed to do so. An appeal shall be allowed to proceed, in accordance with the detailed rules set out in the Rules of Procedure, where it raises, wholly or in part, an issue that is significant with respect to the unity, consistency or development of Union law. The decision as to whether the appeal should be allowed to proceed shall be reasoned and published. The proposed amendments are also intended to ensure the terminological consistency of certain provisions of the Staff Regulations with the Treaties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Commission has consistently made clear that protecting Union citizens in the United Kingdom, as well as United Kingdom nationals in the European Union is a priority. This will require Member States to take a generous approach to the United Kingdom nationals who are already resident in their territory. The expectation is that the United Kingdom acts in the same manner. As of the withdrawal date, in the event there is no withdrawal agreement concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom, Union law on social security coordination will no longer apply in the relations between the Union and the United Kingdom. This means that social security entitlements will not be guaranteed for Union citizens who are, or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States and in situations involving the United Kingdom (e.g. they worked or resided there while the United Kingdom was a Member State of the Union) and also of the United Kingdom nationals who are or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States. This proposal is necessary to protect the social security entitlements of the persons concerned with regard to facts or events occurring and periods completed before the date of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union in order to mitigate the risks associated with the so-called 'no deal' scenario. CONTENT: the proposal aims at ensuring that persons who have exercised, as Union citizens, their right to freedom of movement before the withdrawal date maintain their social security entitlements related to facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. Other relevant persons in situations involving the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, should also maintain those entitlements: stateless persons, refugees, as well as family members and survivors of all the previous categories. Certain core principles of social security coordination as enshrined in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems (assimilation, aggregation, equality of treatment), as well as rules of this Regulation which give practical effect to the implementation of those principles (such as the pro-rata calculation of an old-age pension), should continue to apply in respect of those persons, as regards facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. The proposal does not concern rights accrued after 29 March 2019, nor the exportability of cash benefits, the continued provision of sickness benefits in kind and the rules on applicable legislation. This Regulation shall apply as from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Within the Union, the freedom for the Member States' road haulage operators to provide international carriage of goods by road is regulated primarily on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009, which lay down the common rules for the access to the occupation of road transport operator and for access to the international road haulage market, respectively. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, road freight transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulations upon withdrawal. This would result in the loss of validity of Community licences issued by the United Kingdom to road haulage operators until the withdrawal date, and thereby loss of access to the Union‚Äôs road haulage market for holders of such licences. Similarly, European Union road haulage operators, on the basis of the existing Community licences, would equally lose automatic access to the United Kingdom‚Äôs road freight transport market. More than 80% of road haulage transport between the United Kingdom and the EU-27 is currently carried out by carriers established in the EU-27. In order to avoid serious disruptions and any risk of disturbing public order, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary emergency measures enabling road haulage operators licensed in the United Kingdom to carry goods by road between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to allow UK operators to temporarily transport goods to the EU for 9 months (until 31 December 2019), provided that the United Kingdom grants equivalent rights to EU road hauliers and subject to the conditions of fair competition. The proposal complements the Union rules regulating the carriage of goods by road, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009. Ensure basic connectivity This proposed act would establish basic connectivity subject to equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom. Such connectivity would be ensured in an equal manner for traffic to and from all points in the Union, which avoids distortions in the internal market. The proposed Regulation lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union road haulage operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to UK road haulage operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts, including the limitation to the allowable capacity available to UK road haulage operators or to the number of journeys or to both. Fair competition The proposed Regulation, even though it aims to temporarily ensure basic connectivity for road freight transport, lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators once the United Kingdom will no longer be bound by Union law. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards in the area of road freight transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers and a high level of road safety; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) granting of licences to road haulage operators or to the qualification, training and medical controls for professional drivers. Moreover, it must be ensured that Union carriers are not discriminated against in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the conditions for the granting of the Union operating licence to air carriers and establishes the freedom to provide intra-EU air services. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary in a withdrawal agreement, air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulation upon withdrawal. Moreover, certain air carriers, by reason of their holding an operating licence issued by the United Kingdom, or their principal place of business being located in the United Kingdom, or their being majority owned or effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or its nationals, would cease to meet the conditions laid down in the said Regulation to qualify as Union carriers. The carriers in any of the situations described above would lose their Union operating licence and, as a consequence, no longer enjoy the right to provide intra-Union air services. Direct air transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States are almost entirely in the hands of United Kingdom and Union air carriers. The loss by those air carriers of their right to provide air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would therefore result in serious disruption. Most, if not all, air routes between the Union and the United Kingdom would cease to be served. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The Commission considers it necessary to establish a temporary set of measures enabling carriers licensed in the United Kingdom to provide air transport services between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down provisional measures to govern air transport between the Union and the United Kingdom following the latter's withdrawal from the Union. This proposal complements Union Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. Although the approach followed in the Union's air transport agreements with third countries has been respected in some areas (e.g. operating authorisations), the specific purpose and context of this Regulation, as well as its unilateral nature, necessarily require a more restrictive approach in the grant of rights, as well as specific provisions intended to preserve equality of rights and a level playing field. Maintain basic connectivity The proposed Regulation provides for the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories. No distinction is made between passenger and cargo operations, or scheduled and non-scheduled services. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a short transition period ending 30 March, 2020. Reciprocity and fair competition The measures would enter into force subject to the United Kingdom granting equivalent rights to EU air carriers and ensuring fair competition. Otherwise, the Commission would be empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts, including the limitation or withdrawal of operating authorisations of United Kingdom air carriers. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high standards in the area of air transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) non-discrimination of EU carriers in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. When the Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply to the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom waters (12 nautical miles territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will no longer be part of the Union waters. Consequently, in case of a disorderly withdrawal, Union vessels risk losing access to these waters and fishing opportunities therein as of 30 March 2019. This would have significant impact in terms of fishing activities of the Union fleet and economic returns. The overall dependency of 8 Member States on United Kingdom waters averages 14 % of their overall landings, ranging from 50 % for the Belgium fleet to around 1 % for Spain. At the local community level the socio-economic impact can be significant, where fishing vessels are particularly dependent on access to United Kingdom waters. The fisheries sector also links up to ancillary activities upstream and downstream. Measures are already available under Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council8 that can be used for mitigating the adverse economic effects due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union throughout the whole chain of production and marketing. Under shared management, Member States affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may decide to redirect available appropriations to any necessary measure mitigating its consequences. However, this discretion is currently limited to some priorities. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 lays down the rules and arrangements for granting financial compensation to fishermen and owners of fishing vessels in cases of temporary cessation of fishing activities. The criteria to allow for temporary cessation do not allow for compensation due to the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union and the subsequent loss of access to and fishing opportunities within the waters of that State. In addition to the measures already available under Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the adverse economic effects caused by the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union, public support for the temporary cessation of fishing activities should be available for fishermen and operators that have significant dependence on access to United Kingdom waters. CONTENT: the proposed act would amend Union Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, so as to provide financial mitigation measures Union vessels impacted by a possible closure of the United Kingdom waters due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to allow fishermen and operators from EU Member States to receive compensation from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and apply from the date following the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom and its territory. Alongside this measure to amend the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Commission is proposing a measure on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the multiannual financial framework, annual ceilings, or for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The proposal consists of the frontloading of payment appropriations and is budgetary-neutral over the programming period."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom submitted notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, (‚Äòthe withdrawal date‚Äô). The United Kingdom will then become a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangements that may be contained in a withdrawal agreement, EU legislation on maritime transport will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. One of the areas of Union law that would be affected is the recognition at the Union level of organisations providing services for the inspection and survey of ships flying the flag of Member States (‚Äòrecognised organisations‚Äô). In particular, Regulation (EC) No 391/2009 requires ship inspection and survey organisations recognised at EU level by the Commission (‚Äòrecognised organisations‚Äô) to be assessed at least every two years by the Commission together with the Member State that submitted the initial request for recognition of the organisation. Organisations which were initially recognised by the relevant Member State under the previous legislation and which presently enjoy EU recognition should be assessed in the same way. As a result, the Member State which initially recognised these organisations should be considered the ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô Member State that participates in the Commission‚Äôs assessment. In order to continue enjoying EU recognition, recognised organisations must continue to meet the requirements and minimum criteria set out in Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 391/2009. This is verified through the continuous re-assessment conducted by the Commission and the ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô Member State. As of its withdrawal, the United Kingdom will no longer be in a position to participate in the assessments carried out pursuant to the Regulation for those organisations for which the United Kingdom acts as the ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô Member State. Consequently, the continued validity of the recognition for these organisations at EU level could be called into question and could not be clarified with sufficient legal certainty under the existing provisions of the Regulation. Organisations‚Äô potential loss of EU recognition due to the United Kingdom‚Äôs withdrawal could have adverse consequences for the competitiveness and appeal of the EU-27 Member States' flags that have authorised these recognised organisations to act on their behalf for the purposes of carrying out statutory ship inspections, surveys and certification. The recognised organisations affected currently have authorisation agreements with the majority of the EU-27 Member States and after the United Kingdom‚Äôs withdrawal they would not be able to make use of these recognised organisations for their flagged fleet. The proposed Regulation should only rectify the potential adverse consequences caused/brought about by the United Kingdom‚Äôs withdrawal from the Union on the flags of the 27 Member States . CONTENT: the proposal meets the objective of safeguarding business continuity and the competitiveness of the flags of the EU-27 Member States working with the affected organisations will be attained. It aims to resolve the legal uncertainty created by the United Kingdom's withdrawal in relation to the continued validity of the recognition for organisations for which the United Kingdom acts as the ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô Member State participating in the Commission‚Äôs assessment. The proposed legislative measure would amend Regulation (EC) No 391/2009 by replacing the current requirement, under which only the ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô Member State shall participate in the regular assessment process conducted by the Commission, by introducing the participation of any Member State which has authorised one of the recognised organisations. It would allow the assessment to be carried out by the Commission together with any Member State which has authorised the relevant recognised organisation to act on its behalf and not only the ‚Äòsponsor‚Äô Member State. The Commission should report on its effects after an adequate/sufficient period of application, in particular with a view to identifying any consequences which could go beyond the scope of this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a Union funding instrument, the Connecting Europe Facility, was established by Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The aim of the Connecting Europe Facility is to enable projects of common interest to be prepared and implemented within the framework of the trans-European networks policy in the sectors of transport, telecommunications and energy. Part I of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013 sets out a list of nine core network corridors. Those corridors constitute an instrument to facilitate the coordinated implementation of the core network. They should contribute to the cohesion of the core network through improved territorial cooperation, address wider transport policy objectives and facilitate interoperability, modal integration and multimodal operations. Member States are required to participate in core network corridors. The United Kingdom is part of the North Sea ‚Äì Mediterranean Core Network Corridor (the ‚ÄòNSM corridor‚Äô) which includes links between Belfast, Dublin and Cork on the island of Ireland and links in Great Britain from Glasgow and Edinburgh in the north to Folkestone and Dover in the south. Moreover, United Kingdom sections and nodes are included in the table of ‚Äòpre-identified sections including projects‚Äô of the core network corridors included in Part I of Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013. The United Kingdom submitted notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, (‚Äòthe withdrawal date‚Äô). The United Kingdom will then become a third country, a non-member of the Union. If transitional arrangements are not established in a withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom will no longer be a member of the NSM corridor from 30 March 2019. Given the degree of integration between the Irish and United Kingdom economies, and Ireland‚Äôs location on the geographical edges of the Union, Ireland will be significantly affected by the United Kingdom‚Äôs withdrawal from the Union. The United Kingdom is a vital transport link between Ireland and the continent. The Commission proposes to revise the route alignment of the NSM corridor in order to prevent the corridor from being cut into two distinct parts, with Ireland no longer linked to the continental EU. CONTENT: in order to avoid the North Sea ‚Äì Mediterranean Core Network Corridor being separated into two distinct and unconnected parts and to ensure connectivity of Ireland with mainland Europe, the North Sea ‚Äì Mediterranean Core Network Corridor should include maritime links between the Irish core ports and core ports of Belgium and the Netherlands. The proposed Regulation, by amending Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1316/2013, would adjust the NSM corridor‚Äôs route alignment by adding new maritime links between the Irish core ports of Dublin and Cork and the NSM corridor‚Äôs ports in Belgium (Zeebrugge, Antwerp) and the Netherlands (Rotterdam), It would take effect from the date when the CEF Regulation no longer applies to the United Kingdom, and therefore the United Kingdom no longer be part of the NSM corridor."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: reducing pollution in the seas is an important field of EU action in maritime transport. This was reiterated in the Commission Communication on the EU maritime transport policy until 2018, which calls for zero-waste from maritime traffic. Directive 2000/59/EC regulates the shore side through provisions ensuring the availability of port reception facilities (PRF) and the delivery of waste to those facilities. It implements the relevant international norms, i.e. those contained in MARPOL (the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships). The Commission considers that 17 years after its entry into force, the Directive requires a thorough review. Since the adoption of the Directive in 2000, MARPOL has been strengthened by means of successive amendments so that the scope and definitions of the current Directive are no longer consistent with the international framework. In addition, Member States interpret the key concepts of the Directive differently, which creates confusion among the parties concerned (ships, ports and operators). The Commission therefore proposes to revise the current rules on port reception facilities to tackle marine waste and improve the efficiency of maritime operations in ports by reducing the administrative burden. The proposed Directive will also be instrumental in achieving the target set in the Commission‚Äôs Circular Economy Strategy to reduce by 30 % by 2020 the amount of marine litter found on beaches and lost fishing gear found at sea. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option reconciles the objectives of reducing waste discharges at sea, in particular garbage discharges (marine litter), with the intended reduction of the administrative burden through further alignment with the MARPOL Convention. The option is expected to generate additional compliance and operational costs, in particular from investments in waste collection in ports, the alignment of the cost recovery systems and the development of new capacity for the reception and treatment of new waste streams. However, these costs are expected to be limited. CONTENT: the proposal for a Directive aims to protect the marine environment against the negative effects from discharges of waste from ships using ports located in the Union, while ensuring the smooth operation of maritime traffic, by improving the availability of adequate port reception facilities and the delivery of waste to those facilities. The proposal repeals the current Directive (2000/59/EC) and replaces it with a single new Directive. The proposed Directive will align the EU regime as far as possible with MARPOL, in particular as regards scope, definitions and forms. Scope and definitions : the definition of ‚Äòship-generated waste‚Äô shall be replaced with the more generic definition of ‚Äòwaste from ships‚Äô, defined in relation to the relevant Annexes to MARPOL. This will also include the category of ‚Äòcargo residues‚Äô, as well as the residues from exhaust gas cleaning systems, which comprise of sludge and bleed-off water from these systems. Port reception facilities : Member States shall ensure the availability of port reception facilities adequate to meet the need of the ships normally using the port without causing undue delay to ships. The formalities relating to the use of the facilities are simple and expeditious to avoid undue delays to ships, and the fees charged for delivery do not create a disincentive for ships to use the port reception facilities. An appropriate waste reception and handling plan shall be in place and implemented for each port following ongoing consultations with the relevant parties. Delivery of waste from ships : the master of a ship calling at a Union port shall, before leaving the port, deliver all the waste carried on board of the ship to a port reception facility in accordance with the relevant discharge norms laid down in the MARPOL Convention. The costs of operating port reception facilities for the reception and treatment of waste from ships, other than cargo residues, shall be covered through the collection of a fee from ships. Incentives for delivery : to ensure that the right incentives are provided for the delivery of the different types of waste to port reception facilities, a ‚Äòno special fee‚Äô system is proposed, in which payment of the indirect fee should give ships the right to deliver all their garbage on board, without having to pay any additional direct fees (based on volumes). As fishing vessels and recreational craft will also be included in the indirect fee system, this should also address the disposal of end-of-life fishing nets and passively fished waste. Moreover, the proposal also strengthens the ‚Äògreen ship‚Äô concept so that an effective reward system can be implemented for those vessels that reduce their waste on board. Monitoring compliance with the obligation to deposit waste : standard forms developed by the IMO for waste notification and waste receipt can also be fully incorporated into the Directive. By doing so, parallel forms and systems can be avoided as much as possible. In addition, it is proposed to include the port reception facilities inspections in the Port State Control regime and employ the information and monitoring system, which was developed on basis of the current Directive (Directive 2009/16/EC) and which is based on electronic reporting in SafeSeaNet and THETIS, to facilitate monitoring and enforcement. Exemptions : lastly, the proposal provides for an exemption regime for ships in scheduled and regular traffic to include the largest fishing vessels and pleasure boats, according to their length and gross tonnage, in order to guarantee the proportionality of the scheme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Union Customs Code provides that all exchanges of information between customs authorities and between economic operators and customs authorities, and the storage of such information, are to be made using electronic data-processing techniques. The Work Programme established by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/578 contains a list of 17 electronic systems divided into two categories: (i) fourteen trans-European systems including some systems that have national components for development by the Member States and (ii) three national systems that have to be developed or upgraded by the Member States alone. The Customs Code provides that until all the new electronic systems under the Code are operational, existing electronic and paper-based systems can continue to be used for customs procedures, but only until 31 December 2020 at the latest. While most systems will be deployed by 2020, others will only be partially completed by that date. After consulting the Member States and the economic operators, the Commission considers it necessary to provide for a later date (2025 at the latest) for full completion of work on some of the systems. This target date will ensure the smooth implementation by 2020 of the majority of the systems and the later implementation of the remaining systems, in proper sequence, on dates between 2021 and 2025. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Article 278 of the Code so that transitional arrangements for the exchange and storage of customs information (i.e. existing electronic and paper-based systems) can continue to be used after 2020 for the customs procedures covered by the electronic systems that will not be operational by 2020. The proposed amendment maintains the 2020 deadline in Article 278 while providing for an extension to 2025 for the customs processes concerned by the aforementioned electronic systems that will not be operational by 2020. The possibility of using means other than electronic data processing methods and until 31 December 2025 at the latest concerns two groups of systems: a first group consists of existing electronic systems that must be upgraded to take account of certain requirements of the Code, such as the harmonisation of the requirements on data to be input into the systems. This group consists of three transEuropean systems (the system dealing with Entry Summary Declarations, the system dealing with external and internal transit and the system dealing with goods taken out of the customs territory of the Union) as well as the National Export System (including the export component of the national Special Procedures System); the second group consists of three new trans-European electronic systems (the systems concerning guarantees for a potential or existing customs debt, the customs status of goods and centralised clearance). The proposed delay in implementation of a small number of systems will help to focus attention on ensuring the effective delivery of the other systems by 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment (including payment cards) is a threat to security: as it represents a source of income for organised crime and is therefore an enabler for other criminal activities such as terrorism, drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings; as it is also an obstacle to the digital single market. In 2013, fraud using cards issued in the Single European Payment Area (SEPA) reached EUR 1.44 billion, representing growth of 8% on the previous year. 42% of users are concerned about the security of online payments. The European Agenda on Security acknowledges that Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA insufficiently addresses new challenges and technological developments such as virtual currencies and mobile payments. Currently: certain crimes cannot be prosecuted effectively because offences committed with certain payment instruments (in particular non-corporeal) are criminalised differently in Member States or not criminalised; too much time is taken to provide information in cross-border cooperation requests, hampering investigation and prosecution; information sharing gaps in public-private cooperation hamper prevention and criminals exploit the lack of awareness of victims. Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA therefore needs to be updated and complemented by new provisions on offences, penalties and cross-border cooperation. This proposal has three specific objectives that address the problems identified: ensure that a clear, robust and technology neutral policy/legal framework is in place; eliminate operational obstacles that hamper investigation and prosecution; enhance prevention. Furthermore, revising the present rules will enhance cooperation between the police and judicial authorities as well as between law enforcement agencies and private entities and will contribute to achieving the objectives of the 2001 Council of Europe Cybercrime Convention (Budapest Convention), which represents the international legal reference framework for the EU. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: since the problem is essentially due to a regulatory loophole, the preferred option is to introduce a new legislative framework and to facilitate self-regulation for public-private cooperation and encourage reporting for public-private cooperation instead of self-regulation, and new provisions on raising awareness. CONTENT: the proposal for a Directive seeks to establish minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. While abrogating Framework Decision 2001/413/JHA, the proposal updates most of its current provisions. Specifically, this proposal: defines payment instruments in a broader way , including also 'digital exchange instruments', i.e. any electronic money within the meaning of Directive 2009/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, and virtual currencies; criminalises not only the fraudulent use of payment instruments by means of stolen or falsified payment authenticators but also the possession, sale, obtaining for use, importing, distribution or any other form of making a false or falsified, stolen or appropriate payment instrument available by other illegal means. It covers all offences involving payment instruments, whether they are corporeal or not, and therefore also applies to behaviour such as trade in stolen credentials (‚Äòcarding‚Äô) and phishing; criminalises acts such as hacking a victim‚Äôs computer or a device in order to re-direct the victim‚Äôs traffic to a forged online banking website, thus causing the victim to make a payment to a bank account controlled by the offender; introduces rules on the level of penalties : it sets a minimum level for maximum penalties (at least three years imprisonment) and provides for more severe penalties (at least five years imprisonment) for aggravated offences, namely: (i) situations where criminal acts are committed within the framework of a criminal organisation; (ii) situations where crime is conducted on a large scale causing considerable overall harm or where a crime involves an aggregate advantage for the offender of at least EUR 20 000; clarifies the scope of the jurisdiction regarding the offences referred to in the proposal by ensuring that Member States have jurisdiction in situations where the offender and the information system that the offender uses to commit the crime are located in different territories; obliges Member States to ensure that victims of non-cash payment fraud are offered information and channels to report a crime and advice on how to protect themselves; introduces measures to improve Union-wide criminal justice cooperation by strengthening the existing structure and use of the operational contact points; stresses the need to raise awareness and thus reduce the risk of becoming a victim of fraud by means of information and awareness-raising campaigns, and research and education programmes. The Commission shall assess the effects of the Directive six years after the deadline for its implementation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU consumers and e-retailers do not take full advantage of the single market. In 2014, only 15 % of consumers bought online from other EU countries, although 44 % did so in their own country. A European Parliament study estimated that the potential contribution to European GDP of achieving a fully functioning Digital Single Market could be in the range of EUR 415 billion. The benefits from cross-border e-commerce are estimated at 0.27% of GDP. The Commission‚Äôs 2012 Communication on e-commerce identified improving the physical delivery of goods ordered online as one of the key elements for e-commerce growth. Subsequently, its 2013 Parcel Roadmap set out actions to achieve three sets of objectives: increasing transparency and information for all actors along the e-commerce value chain; improving availability, quality and affordability of delivery solutions; enhancing complaint handling and redress mechanisms for consumers. Although there have been some improvements, the Commission stated that complementary measures are needed in the areas of price transparency and enhanced regulatory oversight given that the prices for some cross-border services are still high and not all national regulatory authorities have the ability to collect the data needed to monitor the evolution of the parcel markets due to differences in their competences and in the definition of the parcel services. In the Digital Single Market Strategy, the Commission committed to launch measures to improve the price transparency and regulatory oversight of cross-border parcel delivery in the first half of 2016. In its resolution entitled ‚ÄòTowards a Digital Single Market Act‚Äô, the European Parliament stressed that accessible, affordable, efficient and high-quality delivery services are an essential prerequisite for cross-border e-commerce to thrive. It also supported measures to improve price transparency and regulatory oversight directed at the smooth functioning of cross-border parcel delivery markets. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment recommended a package of measures to improve the transparency of tariffs of universal service providers and strengthen the regulatory oversight of all parcel service delivery providers. The preferred options would have no direct or indirect negative social impacts. There will be no direct impact on the environmental or fundamental rights. CONTENT: the general objective of this Regulation is to address specific issues relating to cross-border parcel delivery services. It also builds on and complements the rules on cross-border parcel delivery services provided by Directive 97/67/EC as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC and Directive 2008/6/EC. The specific objectives of this proposal are to: make markets work more effectively by making the regulatory oversight of the parcels markets more effective and consistent and encouraging competition; increase the transparency of tariffs in order to reduce unjustifiable tariff differences and lower the tariffs paid by individuals and small businesses, especially in remote areas. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : the definitions complement those contained in Directive 97/67/EC as far as parcels are concerned; they are fully consistent with those established in the Directive. As laid down in the relevant provisions adopted by the Universal Postal Union (UPU) the term terminal rates is used so to encompass both terminal dues (that are applicable for letter mail items) and inward land rates (that apply to parcels). In line with relevant practice of parcel service providers and Member States parcels considered for the scope of this Regulation are those with a maximum weight of 31.5 kg. Therefore, this Regulation will not apply to logistics; it will also not apply to transport alone, that is when it is not undertaken in conjunction with clearance, sorting or distribution. Provision of information : the proposal obliges all parcel delivery providers with over 50 employees to annually submit a limited set of information. The aim is to unify and clarify the currently fragmented regulatory competences and build on existing best practice. Only larger operators in addition to those established in more than one Member State would be included so to ensure that national regulatory authorities have the core data on the range of parcels that are used for e-commerce. Transparency of tariffs and terminal rates : the proposal contains a targeted obligation only for universal service providers to annually submit (on 31 January at the latest) to the national regulatory authority the public list of tariffs applicable on 1 January of each calendar year for a specific set of services contained in the Annex. The 15 postal items provided by universal service providers contained in the Annex are the most relevant and used ones for individual customers and small businesses. This obligation is limited to public list of tariffs and does therefore not include any discounted tariffs or individually negotiated tariffs. The Commission shall publish tariffs by 30 April of each calendar year on a dedicated section on the Commission's EUROPA website. Furthermore, the universal service providers should submit to the national regulatory authorities ‚Äì and in turn to the Commission - annually their terminal rates (i.e. the payments from the originating universal service provider to the destination universal service provider for the costs of transport, sorting and distribution of cross-border items in the destination Member State). Assessing affordability of tariffs : national regulatory authorities are obliged to assess the affordability of the tariffs of universal service providers obtained on the basis of objective elements. The most common and important input elements for this assessment are subject of a non-exhaustive list in the proposal. The assessment together with the justification, if applicable, are to be communicated not only to the Commission but also to the other national regulatory authorities. Furthermore, the assessment should also be communicated to the relevant authorities entrusted with the implementation of competition law, who are equally bound by confidentiality obligations. Transparency and non-discriminatory cross-border access : the proposal is largely a codification of the principles that have been analysed in the so called REIMS decisions (relating to the multilateral cross-border agreements on terminal dues that universal service providers have established on letters/parcels), and is inspired by the procedural elements established in Regulation 531/2012 relating to wholesale roaming access. It should provide legal certainty for universal service providers and other parcel delivery services providers that might want to access cross-border services. Penalties : a standard provision aims at providing the national regulatory authorities with effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for breaches of EU law."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: around 33% of all journeys made by heavy goods vehicles in the EU cross borders between Member States. Around 8 % of cross-border transport in the EU involves busses or coaches. Directive 2003/59/EC lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses, thus improving safety on European roads. Member States have been given significant flexibility in how they implement the Directive, for example on the specific content of driver training and on administrative procedures and the structure of the training system. Having evaluated the implementation of the Directive, the Commission identified a number of shortcomings: difficulties and legal uncertainty in the interpretation of exemptions; the content of the training, which was found to be only partially relevant for drivers' needs; difficulties for drivers in obtaining mutual recognition of completed or partially completed training undergone in another Member State; inconsistencies of minimum age requirements between Directive 2003/59/EC and Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The objective of the proposal is to deal appropriately with the identified shortcomings. The revision of Directive 2003/59/EC would ensure the application of appropriate minimum training requirements and the recognition of training throughout the EU. It would remedy the current problem of mutual recognition which may affect some 46 700 drivers (2016). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred solution to ensure mutual recognition involves issuing driver qualification cards to foreigners. The preferred solution for addressing the training content is to strengthen content on road safety and fuel efficiency in the training courses and make it clear that it is possible to use e-learning/blended learning in the training courses. CONTENT: the proposal amending Directive 2003/59/EC aims essentially to: clarify exemptions : the Directive shall not apply to: (i) vehicles used by, or under the control of, the armed forces, civil defence, the fire service and forces responsible for maintaining public order when the carriage is undertaken as a consequence of the tasks assigned to those services; (ii) vehicles used in states of emergency or assigned to rescue missions; (iii) vehicles used for driving instruction and examination for any person wishing to obtain a driving licence; (iv) vehicles used, or hired without a driver, by agricultural, horticultural, forestry, farming or fishery undertakings for carrying goods as part of their own entrepreneurial activity; ensure that all holders of a CPC are issued either with mutually recognised code 95 on their driving licence, or with a mutually recognised driver qualification card; ensure periodic training ensure at least safety objectives. Periodic training enables holders of a CPC to update the knowledge which is essential for their work, with specific emphasis on road safety and the rationalisation of fuel consumption; offer Member States the possibility to: (i) improve and modernise training practices with the use of ICT tools, such as e-learning and blended learning, for part of the training, while ensuring the quality of the training; (ii) combine different types of relevant training, such as training on the transport of dangerous goods, on disability awareness or on animal transport, with the training provided for in Directive 2003/59/EC; provide a clear derogation in Directive 2006/126/EC, stipulating that driving licences may be issued at the minimum ages provided for in Directive 2003/59/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the defence industry is a major element of the economy of the European Union. For Europe to take over more responsibility for its defence, the Commission considers it crucial to improve competitiveness and enhance innovation across the Union defence industry. The proposal for a European defence industrial development programme aims at enhancing the competitiveness and innovation of the Union defence industry including cyber defence. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the European Defence Action Plan, which sets out measures to achieve greater European defence cooperation and support the competitiveness of the European defence industry. It proposed in particular to launch a European Defence Fund to support investment in joint research and the joint development of defence equipment and technologies. The initiative was welcomed by the European Council and the Commission was invited to present proposals in the first half of 2017. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to establish a European Defence Industrial Development Programme for Union action covering the period from 1st January 2019 to 31 December 2020. The amount for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2019-2020 is set at EUR 500 million in current prices. The Commission will be responsible for the execution and the management structure of the programme. The Programme shall have the following objectives: to foster the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the Union defence industry by supporting actions in their development phase; to support and leverage the cooperation between undertakings in the development of technologies or products in line with defence capability priorities; to foster better exploitation of the results of defence research and contribute to closing the gaps between research and development. The programme will help create a collaborative approach between defence industrial players of the Member States and is expected to reduce wasteful duplications, dispersions and create economies of scale. Union's financial assistance : this shall take the form of grants and financial instruments or via public procurement. The programme shall support the design, definition of common technical specifications, prototyping, testing, qualification and certification of defence products, tangible or intangible components and technologies. Support can also be provided for studies, feasibility assessments and other support activities. Eligible entities : the action shall be undertaken in a cooperation of at least three undertakings which are established in at least two different Member States. Beneficiaries shall be undertakings established in the Union, in which Member States and/or nationals of Member States own more than 50% of the undertaking and effectively control it, whether directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate undertakings. The financial assistance of the Union provided under the Programme may not exceed 20% of the total cost of the action where it relates to prototyping. In all the other cases, the assistance may cover up to the total cost of the action. Award criteria : actions proposed for funding under the Programme shall be evaluated on the basis of the following cumulative criteria: excellence; contribution to the innovation and technological development of defence industries; contribution to the security and defence interests of the Union by enhancing defence technologies which contribute to implement defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the Union; viability of actions, the contribution to the competitiveness of the European defence industry through the demonstration by the beneficiaries that Member States have committed to jointly produce and procure the final product or technology in a coordinated way. The Commission shall regularly monitor the implementation of the programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this imperative by stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed by an Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: for the sake of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Objective : the proposed Regulation provides for a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with the objective of: organising operational coordination of fisheries control and inspection activities by the Member States; assisting Member States to cooperate so as to comply with the rules of the common fisheries policy in order to ensure its effective and uniform application. The Agency's mission shall be to: coordinate : (i) controls and inspections of fisheries by EU countries; (ii) the deployment of national means of control and inspection pooled by EU countries; (iii) operations to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; assist Member States in (i) providing the European Commission and other interested parties with information on fishing activities and control and inspection activities; (ii) fulfilling their obligations under fisheries policy rules; assist Member States and the Commission in harmonising the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy throughout the Union; contribute to the research and development work carried out by the Member States and the Commission on control and inspection techniques; (ii) coordinate the training of inspectors and the sharing of experience between the Member States; (iii) contribute to the harmonised implementation of the control system of the common fisheries policy; cooperate with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, each within its own mandate, to support national authorities carrying out coast guard functions, by providing services, information, equipment and training, as well as coordinating multi-purpose operations. The Agency shall, at the Commission's request: assist the Union and Member States in their relations with third countries and regional international fisheries organisations of which the Union is a member; cooperate with the competent authorities of regional international fisheries organisations regarding the control and inspection obligations of the Union in the framework of working arrangements concluded with such bodies. The Agency shall coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in accordance with joint deployment plans, which organise the use of the available means of control and inspection of the Member States concerned so as to give effect to control and inspection programmes. Fisheries control and inspection activities undertaken by the Member States should be carried out in accordance with common criteria, priorities, benchmarks and procedures regarding control and inspection activities on the basis of such programmes. Organisation : the Agency, based in Vigo, Spain, shall consist of: (i) an Executive Director appointed for a five-year term; (ii) an Advisory Board to assist the Executive Director; and (iii) an Administrative Board (composed of one representative from each EU country and six Commission representatives) which, inter alia, appoints the Executive Director."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: conflict of laws rules governing the third-party (or proprietary) effects of assignments of claims do not currently exist at Union level. These conflict of laws rules are laid down at Member State level, but they are inconsistent and often unclear. In cross border assignments of claims, the inconsistency of national conflict of laws rules leads to legal uncertainty as to which law applies to the third-party effects of the assignments. The assignment of a claim is a legal mechanism whereby a creditor (""assignor"") transfers his right to claim a debt to another person (""assignee""). A claim gives a creditor the right to receive a sum of money or to the performance of an obligation by the debtor. This mechanism is used by companies to obtain liquidity and have access to credit, so-called factoring and collateralisation respectively, and by companies (most often banks) to optimise the use of their capital, also called securitisation. Factoring is a crucial source of liquidity for many firms. The majority of users of factoring are SMEs: Small represent 76%, Medium 11% and Large 13%. Europe as a region is the largest factoring market world-wide and represents 66% of the world market. As part of the Action Plan on Capital Markets Union (CMU) and the Mid-Term Review, the Commission announced targeted action on rules on the ownership of securities and the third-party effects of assignments of claims to reduce legal uncertainty for cross-border transactions in securities and claims. This proposal and the Communication on the law applicable to the proprietary effects of transactions in securities, presented in parallel, implement this commitment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five options have been studied in the impact assessment. The proposal is based on the option that the law of the assignor's habitual residence is a general rule but with certain assignments subject, as an exception, to the law of the assigned claim and with a choice of law possibility for securitisation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation concerns the law applicable to cross-border transactions involving claims or securities. It does not cover the transfer of the contracts (for example derivative contracts), in which both rights (or claims) and obligations are included. The proposal aims to: contribute to the objective of encouraging cross-border investment by reducing the legal uncertainty that may discourage cross-border assignments of claims or lead to additional costs for those transactions; protect investors by reducing losses that may occur when market participants are unaware of the legal risk arising from legal uncertainty; harmonise the conflict of law rules on the third-party effects of assignments of claims, the proposal will provide legal certainty to parties involved in factoring, collateralisation and securitisation and thereby facilitate access to cheaper finance for SMEs and consumers. The solution which the Commission proposes is a general rule that in conflict situations the law of the assignor's habitual residence applies. The law of the assignor's habitual residence is easy to determine and most likely to be the place in which the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the assignor will be opened. The proposal is also particularly suitable for bulk assignments and assignments of receivables under future contracts, which are an important source of finance for SMEs. It is the only law which is consistent with the Union acquis on insolvency, that is, the Insolvency Regulation. The Commission proposes, however, that the law of the assigned claim applies to two types of specific claims, which are therefore exempted from the general rule: cash on the account of a credit institution (for example a bank, where the consumer is the creditor and the credit institution is the debtor); claims derived from financial instruments, such as derivatives. In addition, for securitisation transactions, the Commission proposes a choice between the law of the assignor and the law of the assigned claim."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty provides that the European Parliament and the Council are to establish the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency (Article 133 TFEU). Among these measures is the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. On the basis of this article, the protection of the euro as the single currency is the responsibility of the EU. Counterfeiting of the euro poses a true problem for the Union and for its institutions. Its threats are still substantial, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots, e.g. in Colombia, Peru and China. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting (production and distribution), it is necessary that national protection frameworks be complemented by an EU initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks. The current 2020 Pericles programme is specifically dedicated to the protection of euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting. In the mid-term evaluation of the programme, the Commission came to the conclusion that the continuation of the Pericles 2020 programme beyond 2020 should be supported, given its EU added value, its long-term impact and the sustainability of its actions. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Pericles IV programme, an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The proposed new programme aims to protect euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting and related fraud, by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by the Member States and; by assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations. In particular, the programme shall take responsibility for tackling specific emerging threats (such as deep/dark web) and the relationship with certain countries (e.g. China), as it is difficult for individual Member States to effectively address these threats on their own. Implementation : the programme shall be implemented through direct management by the Commission. Financial support for eligible actions shall be granted under the programme in the form of grants or public contracts. Actions under the programme may be organised jointly by the Commission and other partners having relevant expertise, such as: the national central banks and the European Central Bank (ECB); the National Analysis Centres (NACs) and the Coin National Analysis Centres; the European Technical and Scientific Centre and the mints; Europol, Eurojust and Interpol. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 7.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount is in line with the Commission proposal for the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the dynamically growing Southeast Asian economies, with their over 600 million consumers and a rapidly rising middle class, are key markets for European Union exporters and investors. With a total EUR 208 billion of trade in goods and EUR 77 billion of trade in services (2016), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) taken as a whole is the EU‚Äôs third largest trading partner outside Europe, after the US and China. Within the ASEAN, Singapore is by far the EU‚Äôs largest partner. On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Member States of the ASEAN. On 12 September 2011, the Council authorised the Commission to extend the on-going negotiations with Singapore to cover also investment protection, based on a new EU competence under the Lisbon Treaty. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in 2011 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Singapore an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Singapore. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured the following: Trade committee: the institutional chapter of the FTA establishes a trade committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement. It shall be comprised of representatives of the EU and of Singapore who will meet every two years or at the request of either side. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU-Singapore FTA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It is estimated that foregone duties could reach an amount of EUR 248.8 million upon full implementation of the agreement. The estimate is based on average imports projected for 2025 in the absence of an agreement and represents the annual loss in revenues resulting from the elimination of EU tariffs on imports from Singapore. The EU-Singapore IPA is expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures. The agreement will be the EU‚Äôs second (after the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to incorporate the Investment Court System (ICS) for the resolution of disputes between investors and states. An amount of EUR 200 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2018 onwards (subject to the entry into force of the agreement) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal."

At the same time, a total EUR 263 billion foreign direct investment stock (2016) in the ASEAN makes the EU the first foreign direct investor in the ASEAN, while the ASEAN as a whole is in its turn the second largest Asian foreign direct investor in the EU ‚Äì with a total foreign direct investment stock of EUR 116 billion (2016). Within the ASEAN, Singapore is by far the EU‚Äôs largest partner, accounting for slightly under one-third of EU-ASEAN trade in goods and services, and roughly two-thirds of investments between the two regions. Over 10 000 EU companies are established in Singapore and use it as a hub to serve the whole Pacific Rim. On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Member States of the ASEAN. On 12 September 2011, the Council authorised the Commission to extend the on-going negotiations with Singapore to cover also investment protection, based on a new EU competence under the Lisbon Treaty. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in 2011 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Singapore an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. From the date of its entry into force, the EU-Singapore IPA will replace and supersede the bilateral investment treaties between the Republic of Singapore and EU Member States that are listed in the IPA. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Investment Protection Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Singapore of the other part. Main aim of the IPA: it aims to: In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured the following: Committee: the institutional chapter of the IPA establishes a committee with the main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement. Among other tasks, the committee may, subject to the completion of each side‚Äôs respective legal requirements and procedures, decide to appoint the Members of the ICS Tribunals, fix their monthly retainer and fees, and adopt binding interpretations of the agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU-Singapore FTA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It is estimated that foregone duties could reach an amount of EUR 248.8 million upon full implementation of the agreement. The estimate is based on average imports projected for 2025 in the absence of an agreement and represents the annual loss in revenues resulting from the elimination of EU tariffs on imports from Singapore. The EU-Singapore IPA is expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures. The agreement will be the EU‚Äôs second (after the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to incorporate the Investment Court System (ICS) for the resolution of disputes between investors and states. An amount of EUR 200 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2018 onwards (subject to the entry into force of the agreement) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 25 November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with six ASEAN countries, including Singapore. Negotiations with Singapore were launched in October 2005 and finalised in May 2013. The two sides initialled the PCA in Singapore on 14 October 2013. Negotiations were carried out in consultation with the Working Party on Asia and the Pacific (COASI), as a consultative committee. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing of the Agreement on 16 of July 2018, the Agreement was signed on 19 October 2018 in Brussels. The PCA with Singapore is the fifth agreement with an ASEAN country, following the agreements with Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. It will supersede the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Singapore, of the other part. This agreement with Singapore constitutes a stepping stone towards enhanced political and economic involvement of the EU in South-East Asia. It will provide the basis for more effective bilateral engagement by the EU and its Member States with Singapore by strengthening political dialogue and enhancing cooperation in a broad range of areas. The agreement covers the EU‚Äôs standard political clauses on human rights, International Criminal Court (ICC), Weapons of Mass Destructions (WMD), Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and counter-terrorism. It also provides for the possibility of suspending the application of the Agreement or of any specific agreement in case of a violation of essential elements of the agreement, i.e. the human rights clause and the non-proliferation clause. It also encompasses cooperation in areas such as: The agreement establishes a Joint Committee to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the Agreement. It is complemented by a free trade agreement and an investment protection agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the area of justice requires judicial cooperation across borders. For this purpose, and to facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market, the EU adopted Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters and Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence. These instruments are crucial in the regulation of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Member States. In 2018, approximately 3.4 million civil and commercial court proceedings in the EU have cross-border implications. In many such proceedings, there is a need to obtain evidence from another Member State; the Regulation on the taking of evidence provides tools that facilitate access to that evidence. In 2017, to support relevant, comprehensive and up-to-date analysis and conclusions on the practical operation of the Regulation, the Commission undertook a regulatory fitness (REFIT) evaluation. The findings showed that contacts between the bodies designated by the Regulation are still almost exclusively paper-based, with adverse impacts on cost and effectiveness. Also, videoconferencing is rarely used to hear persons in another Member State. The proposal therefore addresses the need for modernisation, in particular digitalisation and the use of modern technology in the cross-border taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters. It also addresses the following other problems highlighted by the evaluation: delays and costs for citizens, businesses and Member States, shortcomings in the protection of procedural rights and legal complexity and uncertainty. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal amending the Regulation on cross-border service. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a policy package involving a number of measures: using electronic transmission as the default channel for electronic communication and document exchanges; promoting modern means of taking evidence such as videoconferencing if a person needs to be heard from another Member State and incentives (via the financing of national projects) for Member States to equip courts with videoconferencing facilities; removing legal barriers to the acceptance of electronic (digital) evidence; tackling divergent interpretations of the term ‚Äòcourt‚Äô; raising courts‚Äô and legal professionals‚Äô awareness of the availability of the direct channel of taking evidence under the Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal aims to improve the efficiency and speed of obtaining cross-border evidence. To this end, it adapts Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 to technical developments, exploiting the advantages of digitisation and ensuring greater use of videoconferencing. In concrete terms, the proposed amendments: define the term ‚Äòcourt‚Äô to mean any judicial authority in a Member State which is competent for the performance of taking of evidence according to this Regulation; introduce the mandatory electronic transmission, as a rule, of requests and communications. In exceptional cases, i.e. where the system is interrupted or not suitable for the transmission in question (e.g. transmission of a DNA sample as evidence), other channels can still be used; ensure a more appropriate, more frequent and faster use of direct taking of evidence via videoconference, where available to the courts in question and appropriate in the light of the specific circumstances of the case; facilitate the taking of evidence by diplomatic officers or consular agents. The Article provides that such persons may, in the territory of another Member State and in the area where they exercise their functions, take evidence without the need for a prior request, by hearing nationals of the Member State which they represent without compulsion in the context of proceedings pending in the courts of that Member State; ensure that digital evidence taken in accordance with the law of the Member State where it was taken is not rejected as evidence in other Member States solely due to its digital nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not impose significant costs on national administrations, but rather lead to savings. Costs relating to the development, implementation and maintenance of electronic communication and document exchanges, and to the acquisition, implementation and operation of professional, high-end videoconferencing equipment could be co-funded. The main EU funding opportunities under the current financial programmes are the Justice programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package for the digital transformation priority, as unveiled on 2 May 2018, includes EUR 3 billion for a digital strand of the CEF, to finance digital connectivity infrastructure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2008, Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service of documents provides for fast-track channels and uniform procedures for transmitting documents from one Member State to another. Together with Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation in the taking of evidence, it is a crucial instrument in the regulation of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Member States. In 2018, approximately 3.4 million civil and commercial court proceedings in the EU have cross-border implications. In most of these cases (namely in those where at least one party resides in another Member State than the one where the proceedings takes place), courts often apply the Regulation on service of documents several times in the course of the proceedings. This is because additional documents often have to be served formally (such as the decisions closing the proceedings), in addition to the document instituting the proceedings. In 2017, to support the analysis of the practical application of the Regulation, the Commission undertook a regulatory fitness (REFIT) evaluation, On the traditional channel of transmission of a document to another Member State for purposes of service there - transmission through the so-called transmitting and receiving agencies - the evaluation revealed that this workflow is underperforming in that it still works more slowly and less efficiently than expected. The deadlines proposed in the Regulation are regularly exceeded and modern channels of communication are in practice not used. The evaluation also concluded that as regards the alternative methods of transmission and service of documents providing direct channels to serve documents in the territory of other Member States, the evaluation concluded that although they provide smoother solutions to assist cross-border judicial proceedings, there are ways in which they could be improved : service by post under the Regulation is a popular, quick and relatively cheap way of delivering the document to the addressee, but it is not very reliable and has a high failure rate. The so-called direct service provides a reliable solution but access to it is limited. This proposal is closely linked to the proposal amending the Regulation on the taking of evidence. The two proposals are presented together by the Commission, and constitute a package for the modernisation of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: as part of the preferred package, the effectiveness of the current regulation would be improved, mainly by reducing costs and delays. In particular, the impact assessment identified two changes that should be useful: mandatory electronic communication between the agencies and the facilitation of electronic and direct service. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 sets up a framework of judicial cooperation aligned with the digital single market strategy. It will help improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border proceedings by reducing the time spent on sending documents between agencies and by reducing reliance on paper-based communication. Specifically, the proposal: provides that the communication and exchange of documents between sending and receiving authorities is carried electronically, through a decentralised IT system made up of national IT systems interconnected by a secure and reliable communication infrastructure; ensures that alternative (traditional) means of communication are used in cases of unforeseen and exceptional disruption of the IT system; requires Member States to provide assistance in locating the whereabouts of a recipient in another Member State if the initiator of the service of the document either does not have any such information (‚Äòwhereabouts unknown‚Äô) or if the information at his/her disposal turns out to be incorrect; improves the procedure on the right of the addressee to refuse to accept the document if it is not drawn up or translated into an appropriate language; obliges the postal service providers to use a specific return slip (acknowledgement of receipt) when serving documents by post under the Regulation; introduces a minimum standard concerning persons to be regarded as eligible ‚Äòsubstituting recipients‚Äô if the postal service provider cannot hand over the document on the addressee in person; introduces a new measure to facilitate access to the direct service of documents, by extending the scope of application of the Regulation. Allowing direct service both for (i) transmitting agencies or (ii) the courts seised with the proceedings in the Member State of origin and in the territory of all Member States would lead to more direct and speedy transmission of documents compared to the baseline; introduces the electronic service of documents as an additional alternative method of service under the Regulation; requires the court seised with the proceedings to send an alert message about the initiation of the proceedings or about the default judgment to the available user account of the defendant in absentia and sets the time period for the availability of the extraordinary review to two years as of the issuance of the default judgment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not impose significant costs on national administrations, but rather lead to savings. The main costs for Member States will come from the implementation of electronic communication as mandatory for transmitting and receiving agencies. The main EU funding opportunities under the current financial programmes are the Justice programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package for the digital transformation priority, as unveiled on 2 May 2018, includes EUR 3 billion for a digital strand of the CEF, to finance digital connectivity infrastructure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Within the Union, the freedom for the Member States' road haulage operators to provide international carriage of goods by road is regulated primarily on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009, which lay down the common rules for the access to the occupation of road transport operator and for access to the international road haulage market, respectively. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, road freight transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulations upon withdrawal. This would result in the loss of validity of Community licences issued by the United Kingdom to road haulage operators until the withdrawal date, and thereby loss of access to the Union‚Äôs road haulage market for holders of such licences. Similarly, European Union road haulage operators, on the basis of the existing Community licences, would equally lose automatic access to the United Kingdom‚Äôs road freight transport market. More than 80% of road haulage transport between the United Kingdom and the EU-27 is currently carried out by carriers established in the EU-27. In order to avoid serious disruptions and any risk of disturbing public order, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary emergency measures enabling road haulage operators licensed in the United Kingdom to carry goods by road between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to allow UK operators to temporarily transport goods to the EU for 9 months (until 31 December 2019), provided that the United Kingdom grants equivalent rights to EU road hauliers and subject to the conditions of fair competition. The proposal complements the Union rules regulating the carriage of goods by road, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009. Ensure basic connectivity This proposed act would establish basic connectivity subject to equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom. Such connectivity would be ensured in an equal manner for traffic to and from all points in the Union, which avoids distortions in the internal market. The proposed Regulation lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union road haulage operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to UK road haulage operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts, including the limitation to the allowable capacity available to UK road haulage operators or to the number of journeys or to both. Fair competition The proposed Regulation, even though it aims to temporarily ensure basic connectivity for road freight transport, lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators once the United Kingdom will no longer be bound by Union law. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards in the area of road freight transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers and a high level of road safety; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) granting of licences to road haulage operators or to the qualification, training and medical controls for professional drivers. Moreover, it must be ensured that Union carriers are not discriminated against in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the conditions for the granting of the Union operating licence to air carriers and establishes the freedom to provide intra-EU air services. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary in a withdrawal agreement, air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulation upon withdrawal. Moreover, certain air carriers, by reason of their holding an operating licence issued by the United Kingdom, or their principal place of business being located in the United Kingdom, or their being majority owned or effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or its nationals, would cease to meet the conditions laid down in the said Regulation to qualify as Union carriers. The carriers in any of the situations described above would lose their Union operating licence and, as a consequence, no longer enjoy the right to provide intra-Union air services. Direct air transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States are almost entirely in the hands of United Kingdom and Union air carriers. The loss by those air carriers of their right to provide air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would therefore result in serious disruption. Most, if not all, air routes between the Union and the United Kingdom would cease to be served. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The Commission considers it necessary to establish a temporary set of measures enabling carriers licensed in the United Kingdom to provide air transport services between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down provisional measures to govern air transport between the Union and the United Kingdom following the latter's withdrawal from the Union. This proposal complements Union Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. Although the approach followed in the Union's air transport agreements with third countries has been respected in some areas (e.g. operating authorisations), the specific purpose and context of this Regulation, as well as its unilateral nature, necessarily require a more restrictive approach in the grant of rights, as well as specific provisions intended to preserve equality of rights and a level playing field. Maintain basic connectivity The proposed Regulation provides for the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories. No distinction is made between passenger and cargo operations, or scheduled and non-scheduled services. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a short transition period ending 30 March, 2020. Reciprocity and fair competition The measures would enter into force subject to the United Kingdom granting equivalent rights to EU air carriers and ensuring fair competition. Otherwise, the Commission would be empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts, including the limitation or withdrawal of operating authorisations of United Kingdom air carriers. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high standards in the area of air transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) non-discrimination of EU carriers in the United Kingdom."

BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Union. For that purpose, a system of certificates has been established for various aviation activities, in order to achieve the required safety levels and to enable the necessary verifications and the mutual acceptance of certificates issued. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement affects in particular the validity of certificates and licenses originating from the United Kingdom issued under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. The Commission proposes therefore to set up a temporary mechanism, to extend the validity of certain aviation safety certificates, in order to allow the operators concerned and the Agency sufficient time to issue the necessary certificates under Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking account of the United Kingdom's status as a third country. CONTENT: the proposal aims to put in place a mechanism to temporarily extend (for 9 months) the validity of certain aviation safety certificates in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. It would thus allow post-Brexit EU-27 manufacturers to continue their production and operators to continue to use these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. This Regulation shall apply to the certificates listed in the Annex to this Regulation, which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by any of the following: - the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom as set out in Section 1 of the Annex; - natural or legal persons certified by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom as set out in Section 2 of the Annex.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: the present Commission proposal for a Council decision aims at formally concluding the compensatory agreements reached between the European Union and several WTO Members in order to obtain a consolidated GATS schedule of specific commitments covering all the Member States who were members of the European Union in 2006. The terms and conditions under which WTO Members commit access to their market to the services and service suppliers of other WTO Members are specified in their GATS schedules of specific commitments. The original schedule of specific commitments of the European Union and its Member States (‚Äòthe EU GATS schedule‚Äô) dates back to 1994, and only covers those twelve Member States who were members of the European Union at that time. The thirteen Member States that have joined the European Union in 1995 and 2004 continued to maintain their individual GATS schedules, which were adopted prior to their accession to the European Union. In order to ensure that those thirteen Member States did not maintain commitments which would be in breach of the acquis communautaire and that they were covered by the horizontal limitations included in the EU GATS schedule, it was necessary to notify the modification and withdrawal of certain specific commitments included in the EU GATS schedule and in the individual GATS schedules of the thirteen Member States concerned, and to consolidate those individual schedules with the EU GATS schedule. To this end, on 28 May 2004, the European Union notified to the WTO the modification and withdrawal of certain commitments included in the EU GATS schedule and in the GATS schedules of the thirteen Member States concerned. The European Union subsequently entered into negotiations with eighteen WTO Members, who claimed to be affected by these modifications and withdrawals, under Article XXI of GATS. In the course of such negotiations, in accordance with the Council Conclusions of 26 July 2006, the European Union agreed on the compensation to be offered to the affected WTO Members. The notified modifications and withdrawals, together with the agreed compensatory adjustments, were incorporated into a consolidated EU GATS schedule, the certification of which was concluded pursuant to the applicable WTO rules on 15 December 2006. Thereby, the European Union became the first member of the World Trade Organization that successfully used the GATS provisions on the modification and withdrawal of commitments. As a result of the successful consolidation of the EU GATS schedule, its services commitments could be presented in a single document covering its, at that time, twenty five Member States (hereafter ‚Äòthe EU25 consolidated schedule‚Äô). The agreed compensatory adjustments constituted a satisfactory and balanced outcome of the negotiations and should therefore be approved on behalf of the European Union. Accordingly, on 27 March 2007, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Agreements. On 23 July 2007, the Council agreed on the text of a draft decision of the Council and of the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council approving the conclusion of the Agreements on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. On 11 October 2007 the Parliament, in a consultation procedure, approved the conclusion of the Agreements. At this stage, the Council has not yet approved the conclusion of the Agreements, which have not been ratified by all the Member States concerned. The fact that the Agreements have not yet been formally concluded is hindering the consolidation process of the EU GATS schedule regarding the Member States having joined the European Union after 2006, since the WTO Members who claimed to be affected by the modifications of the schedules of those Member States refuse to engage in this process until the legal status of the Agreements had been clarified."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative is part of the third ‚ÄòEurope on the Move‚Äô package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. Investment in transport infrastructure significantly contributes to achieving these objectives. In particular, the completion of the Trans-European Network for Transport (TEN-T) core network and its corridors is expected to generate an additional EUR 4.500 billion or 1.8% of EU GDP and account for 13 million job-years until 2030. Notwithstanding the necessity and binding timelines, experience has shown that many investments aiming to complete the TEN-T are confronted with complex permit granting procedures, cross-border procurement procedures and other procedures. This situation jeopardises the on time implementation of projects and in many cases results in significant delays and increased costs. In order to address these issues and make synchronised TEN-T completion possible,, harmonised action is necessary at Union level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options were based on increasing levels of intervention, ambition and ‚Äòcumulative‚Äô expected impact. The preferred option is that of a limited binding action to be decentralised and implemented at national level. The specific expected benefits should be as follows: time savings in the permit granting procedures; 5 billion in user cost savings; mobilisation, before 2025, of 84% of total investment in the TEN-T core network; 700 million and an estimated reduction in CO2 emissions of 2.686 thousand tonnes for the period 2018-2030; 150 million net savings for project promoters and public authorities. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks the effective and timely completion of TEN-T across the Union, by reducing the risk of delays and increasing the level of certainty for project promoters and investors as regards the length of the applicable procedures. Another objective is to facilitate the involvement of private investors and provide more clarity on public consultations. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Priority status of projects of common interest : each project of common interest on the TEN-T core network shall be subject to an integrated permit granting procedure managed by a single competent authority designated by each Member State. Where priority status exists under national law, projects of common interest shall be granted the status with the highest national significance possible, and be treated as such in permit granting procedures, where and in the manner such treatment is provided for in national legislation applicable to the corresponding types of transport infrastructure. Integration of the permit granting procedures : the proposal requires that the authorisation of TEN-T projects is handled by one single authority that manages and takes ownership of the overall process and acts as the single entry point for project promoters and other investors. The proposal deals with the designation and role of such an authority and defines the procedural steps leading to a comprehensive decision authorising the investor to go ahead with the project. Permit granting procedures are be expected to last up to a maximum of three years which is a significant improvement in comparison to the current situation. Coordination : the proposal stresses the importance of coordinating permit granting procedures across borders and strengthens the role of the European Coordinators in monitoring the permit granting procedure. Public procurement : the proposal provides for the application of only one legal framework on public procurement for cross-border projects. Unless otherwise specified in an intergovernmental agreement, joint entities developing such projects will apply a single national legislation to procure works and services when implementing the project."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms and repealing Council Directive 90/220/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 on genetically modified food and feed establish a comprehensive legal framework for the authorisation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which is fully applicable to GMOs to be used for cultivation purposes throughout the EU as seeds or other plant propagating material. Under this set of legislation, GMOs for cultivation shall undergo an individual risk assessment before being authorised to be placed on the Union market. The aim of this authorisation procedure is to ensure a high level of protection of human life and health, animal health and welfare, the environment and consumer interests, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market. Once a GMO is authorised for cultivation purposes in accordance with the EU legislative framework on GMOs and complies, as regards the variety that is to be placed on the market, with the requirements of EU legislation on the marketing of seed and plant propagating material, Member States are not authorised to prohibit, restrict, or impede its free circulation within their territory, except under the conditions defined by EU legislation. Experience has shown that cultivation of GMOs is an issue which is more thoroughly addressed by Member States, either at central or at regional and local level. Contrary to issues related to the placing on the market and the import of GMOs, which should remain regulated at EU level to preserve the internal market, cultivation has been acknowledged as an issue with a strong local/regional dimension. In accordance with Article 2(2) TFEU Member States should therefore be entitled to have a possibility to adopt rules concerning the effective cultivation of GMOs in their territory after the GMO has been legally authorised to be placed on the EU market. In this context, it appears appropriate to grant to Member States, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, more freedom to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate GMO crops on their territory without changing the system of Union authorisations of GMOs and independently of the measures that Member States are entitled to take by application of Article 26a of Directive 2001/18/EC to avoid the unintended presence of GMOs in other products. IMPACT ASSESSEMENT: the Commission considers that the amendment of the legislation is necessary to get the right balance between maintaining the EU system of authorisations based on the scientific assessment of health and environmental risks and the need to grant freedom to Member States to address specific national or local aspects raised by the cultivation of GMOs. This approach, while preserving the EU authorisation system of GMOs as well as the free circulation and import of GM food, feed and seeds, is expected to address the demands of several Member States and receive public support. It is also estimated that the potential economic and social benefits of this proposal are likely to outweigh the potential disadvantages. Member States may be in a more appropriate position to carry out their own impact assessments to justify their decisions about cultivation of GMOs in their territories at national/regional/local levels. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal amends Directive 2001/18/EC by introducing a new Article which allows Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of authorised GMOs in part or all of their territories on grounds other than those covered by the environmental risk assessment under the EU authorisation system and those related to avoiding the unintended presence of GMOs in other products. This amendment will apply to GMOs authorised for cultivation either under Directive 2001/18/EC or Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 which also covers applications for cultivation if they concern GMOs that are intended as source materials for the further production of food and feed. It will equally apply to cultivation of all varieties of seed and plant propagating material placed on the market in accordance with relevant EU legislation. The freedom which Member States will obtain will only concern the act of GMO cultivation, but not the placing on the market and import of authorised GM seeds which must continue unimpeded within the framework of the internal market and the respective international obligations of the Union. The proposal sets out two series of conditions under which Member States can take measures: As the assessment of the safety of GMOs for human/animal health and the environment is carried out at EU level, Member States have the possibility under the existing legal framework to invoke the special procedures of the safeguard clause of Directive 2001/18/EC (Article 23) or the emergency measure of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 (Article 34) in case they have serious grounds to consider that the authorised product is likely to constitute a serious risk to health and environment. Consequently, the proposal stipulates that Member States cannot invoke protection of health and environment to justify a national ban of cultivation of GMOs outside these special procedures. Member States can thus invoke grounds (other than those covered by the environmental risk assessment under the EU authorisation system) to restrict or prohibit cultivation of GMOs in their territories. The measures taken by the Member States have to be in conformity with the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), in particular as regards the principle of non-discrimination between national and non-national products and the provisions on quantitative restrictions of trade between Member States (Articles 34 and 36 TFEU). They should finally be consistent with the international obligations of the EU, and in particular with the ones established under the World Trade Organisation (WTO). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal has no financial implications for the Union budget. It will have no impact on small or medium-sized undertakings different than the impact of the current situation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the GFCM Agreement provides an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilisation of living marine resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels which are considered sustainable and at low risk of collapse. The European Union, as well as Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Slovenia are contracting parties to the GFCM Agreement. At its Annual Sessions in 2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral in its area of competence to be implemented in Union law. The GFCM adopted other recommendations laying down: measures for the mitigation of incidental catches of seabirds, sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans in fishing activities in the GFCM Agreement area to be implemented in Union law; measures aiming to ensure in its area of competence a high level of protection from fishing activities to sharks and rays, and in particular to the shark and ray species listed as endangered or threatened under Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean to the Barcelona Convention; measures for fisheries exploiting small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea which should be implemented in Union law. Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM Agreement area. It is proposed to amend this Regulation to include the measures contained in the GFCM recommendations. CONTENT: the proposal contains technical measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral, the mitigation of incidental captures of seabirds, sea turtles and cetaceans and the conservation of monk seals, sharks and rays in the GFCM Agreement area. Such measures go beyond the protection already ensured to these species at EU level by the Habitats Directive and other Union acts and include specific recording and reporting obligations for both operators and Member States. The proposal also implements in Union law certain measures for fisheries for small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea. DELEAGTED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Japan is the world‚Äôs third largest economy outside of the EU in terms of GDP, yet only EU's seventh largest trading partner. It has a population of over 127 million inhabitants with a very high purchasing power. It is a key market for European Union exporters, services providers and investors. On 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The Free Trade Agreement with Japan was renamed the ""Economic Partnership Agreement"" (the EPA) at the time of the conclusion of an agreement in principle on 6 July 2017. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2012, the Commission has negotiated with Japan an ambitious and comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners. The texts of the EPA after the finalisation of the negotiations were published in December 2017. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission notably secured the following: Joint committee: the EPA establishes a Joint committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the Agreement. It shall be comprised of representatives of the EU and of Japan who will meet once a year or in urgent cases at the request of either side. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EPA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It will lead to an estimated loss of duties of EUR 970 million at the entry into force of the Agreement. After the EPA is fully implemented (after 15 years from its entry into force) the yearly loss of duties is estimated to reach EUR 2.084 billion. This estimation is based on a projection of the evolution of trade for the next 15 years without any agreement. On the other hand, the EPA is not expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures."

Whilst a first step towards more coherent and simpler financial rules was achieved in 2012 with the proposals for the programmes covered by the MFF 2014-2020, the Commission considers that there is room for further simplification. This is confirmed by the experience gained since 2014 and by the work of the High Level Group of independent experts on monitoring simplification for beneficiaries of the European Structural and Investment Funds. (ESI Funds). The Commission wishes to continue efforts to remove bottlenecks, ensure synergies and complementarities between ESI Funds and the other EU funds and improve efficiency of delivery and control requirements. The simplification of the Union's financial rules should also help to reduce the costs and time involved in the implementation of EU funds, as well as the number of errors. It should also increase the impact of policies and improve their results on the ground. CONTENT: the proposal forms an integral part of the mid-term review/revision of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2014-2020. It consists of an ambitious revision of the general financial rules accompanied by corresponding changes to the sectorial financial rules set out in 15 legislative acts concerning multiannual programmes. The main thrusts of the simplification proposed by the Commission are: easier access for recipients of EU funds : measures relate to grants (removal of the non-cumulative award check for low-value grants and of the non-profit principle; simpler rules for ""contribution in kind"" valuation; recognition of volunteer work; grant awards without calls for proposal under specific conditions) and simplified forms of grants; encourage reliance as far as possible on one single audit, assessment or authorisation (conformity to State aids for instance), when the audit, assessment or authorisation meets the necessary conditions to be taken into account in the EU system; allowing the application of only one set of rules to hybrid actions or in the case of combination of measures or instruments; more effective use of financial instruments , reducing burdensome requirements related to publication of individual data of final recipients or to the exclusion criteria; the establishment of several ways to increase budgetary flexibility , through the creation of a ""flexibility cushion"" for unforeseen needs and new crises in the external actions geographic instruments budget, a more effective activation of the Solidarity Fund and the Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the extension of trust funds to internal policies and the creation of an EU crisis reserve based on the reuse of decommitted appropriations; a stronger focus on results through lump sums, prizes, payment based on output and results rather than on reimbursement of costs, payment against conditions to be fulfilled. Reports are regrouped around the draft budget and the integrated financial reporting package, in order to increase efficiency and transparency both towards the general public and the budgetary authority; a simpler and leaner Union administration , in particular through agreements or delegations between institutions or bodies with a view to pooling the execution of administrative appropriations in the European Offices or in the executive agencies; greater participation of citizens who could be consulted on the implementation of the Union budget by the Commission, the Member States and any other entity implementing the Union budget. With regard to agricultural provisions in particular, the proposal aims, inter alia, at: ensuring legal certainty and harmonised and non-discriminatory implementation of support to young farmers; it is provided that the ""date of setting up"" is the date when the setting up process begins by means of an action to be performed by the applicant, and that the application for support is to be submitted within 24 months from that date; clarifying the rules on the joint setting up of young farmers and the thresholds for access to aid; providing that start-up support granted to young farmers under Article 19 of Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 may also be provided in the form of financial instruments; providing for the possibility for Member States, in duly justified cases, to support farmers through sector-specific income stabilisation tools, in particular for sectors experiencing severe income drops; establishing that when the investment is linked to emergency measures following natural disasters, catastrophic events, adverse climatic events or a sudden and significant change in the socio-economic situation of the Member State or region, expenses incurred after the occurrence event in question would be eligible; reducing the administrative burden of implementing the three criteria to be met in order to be considered an active farmer; authorising the Commission to adopt delegated acts to continue to provide voluntary coupled support until 2020 on the basis of production units for which such support has been granted during a previous reference period."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the development of digital technologies and internet has transformed the distribution of and access to television and radio programmes, with 49% of European internet users (Eurostat estimate) accessing music, audiovisual content and games online. Broadcasters and retransmission service providers are increasingly investing in the development of digital and online services for the distribution of radio and television programmes. However, despite the growing variety of online services, broadcasters‚Äô programmes often remain unavailable online to European citizens living in other Member States. In addition, the variety of TV and radio channels from other Member States provided by retransmission services differs across the EU. Broadcasting organisations transmit on a daily basis a high number of programmes that they license from others or produce themselves. These programmes incorporate a variety of protected content such as audiovisual, musical, literary or graphic works. This requires a complex clearance of rights with a multitude of right holders. Operators of retransmission services, which aggregate a high number of TV and radio channels into packages, also face difficulties for acquiring all the rights necessary to retransmit the television and radio programmes of broadcasting organisations. The Satellite and Cable Directive does not extend to retransmission services provided by means other than cable over closed electronic communication networks, such as IPTV (TV/radio over closed circuit IP-based networks). This proposal responds to one of the key objectives identified in the Digital Single Market Strategy: to enhance wider online access to TV and radio programmes by users across the EU. It is presented in parallel with: a proposal for a directive to modernise certain aspects of the Union copyright framework to take account of technological developments; and a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two sets of policy options, aimed at facilitating the clearance of rights (i) for the online transmissions of TV and radio programmes; and (ii) for digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes: as regards online transmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application to broadcasters' online services which are ancillary to the initial broadcasts (notably simulcasting and catch-up services); as regards digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application of mandatory collective management of rights to IPTV retransmission services and other retransmission services provided over ""closed"" electronic communications networks, CONTENT: the draft regulation aims to promote the cross-border provision of online services ancillary to broadcasts and to facilitate digital retransmissions over closed networks of TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States by adapting the Union legal framework. The proposal defines the services covered by the measures (notably ""ancillary online services"" and ""retransmission"" services). These definitions will be applied in a uniform manner in the Union. The proposal concerns the facilitation of the clearance of rights for ancillary online services by broadcasting organisations by introducing a principle of country of origin, according to which the copyright relevant act takes place solely in the Member State where the broadcasting organisation is established. It also facilitates the clearance of rights for retransmission services provided over closed networks (other than cable), by introducing rules on mandatory collective management. By addressing the difficulties related to the clearance of rights, the proposal will promote consumers' access to more TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States, both as concerns ancillary online services of broadcasting organisations and retransmission services. The proposal provides that the Commission shall carry out a review of the Regulation and present a report on its main findings. It obliges Member States to provide the Commission with necessary information for the preparation of that report."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2014, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America. On 17 July 2015, in the light of the amendments made in the meantime, the Commission presented an initial amended proposal for codification of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 (see the summary dated the same day). Having regard to the amendments adopted in respect of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 and in view of the work already carried out in the course of the legislative procedure, the Commission has decided to present another amended proposal for codification of the Regulation in question. CONTENT: the main elements of the new amended proposal are as follows: Additional rights : the amended proposal stipulates that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are suspended in respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation. It provides the imposition of an additional 4.35 % ad valorem duty on products originating in the United States listed in that Annex. This duty would be in addition to the customs duties applicable under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Union Customs Code. Annual adjustments : the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the United States' Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‚ÄòCDSOA‚Äô) to the Union at that time. The Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty or the list in Annex I under the following conditions: the level of nullification or impairment shall be equal to 72 % of the amount of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities; the amendment shall be made so that the effect of the additional import duty on imports of the selected products originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the level of nullification or impairment ($ 27.81 million); the Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty when the level of suspension cannot be adjusted to the level of nullification or impairment by adding or removing products from the list in Annex I. Another amendment seeks to add the reference to Commission Delegation Regulation (EU) 2017/750 in Annex III. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. CONTENT: in June 2003, the European Community and its Member States were given a mandate to negotiate an Agreement with the United States of America for an ‚ÄúAir Transport Agreement‚Äù. The mandate was given following rulings by the European Court of Justice in November 2002 which stated that existing bi-lateral arrangements in the air transport sector were incompatible with EU law. Currently, there are twenty separate Agreements in place governing the laws and provisions of air operations between Europe and the US. The objective of the negotiations, therefore, was the establishment of an ‚ÄúOpen Aviation Area‚Äù (OOA) between the EU and US. The idea being to create a single market for air transport between the EU and US in which EU and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction and which would include the domestic markets of both parties. Given the wide-ranging implications of such an Agreement, most notably the requirement for the US to remove restrictions on foreign legal ownership and control of US airlines cabotage, the Agreement became a politically sensitive issue for the US government. To address this problem both parties have agreed to a staggered implementation of the Agreement. At the same time, however, there is an implicit understanding that mechanisms should be put in place which allow the Agreement to become more complete. As a first stage, the EU has accepted that cabotage will not be included in the first Agreement. The EU has made clear to the US that this would only be acceptable if meaningful progress can be made towards the removal of restrictions on ownership and control of US airlines. As such the Council has stated that it will take particular notice of progress made by the US Department of Transportations and its pledge to re-interpret the statutory requirement that US airlines can only be under the ‚Äúactual control‚Äù of US citizens. In other words, the adoption of this Decision by the Council will be subject to US adoption of rules deemed to constitute clear, meaningful and robust changes to the US‚Äô policy vis-√†-vis foreign ownership of its commercial air fleet. Depending on the speed with which the US confirms its commitment to re-assessing its current statutes, signature of the Agreement could take place in the first half of 2006. The Agreement represents a comprehensive first-stage agreement that will replace the existing bilateral agreements concluded by the Member States with the United States. It removes all existing restrictions on the rights of both Community air carriers and Unites States air carriers to operate between points in the European Community and points in the United States. Further, the Agreement established provisions which allow Community air carriers uniform conditions for market access; it establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation between the European Community and the United States and it establishes provisions essential to the safe, secure and efficient operation of transatlantic air services. There will be strengthened co-operation in matters concerning aviation security and aviation safety and there will be new arrangement for co-operation between the EU-US Competition authorities concerning the application of their respective competition regimes affecting the transatlantic market. All of the terms will simultaneously apply to the 25 EU Member States who will apply the same rules without discrimination and in a uniform manner. In return, Community air carriers will be able to access commercial opportunities, which Member States, acting individually, have been unable to secure. In short, adoption of the proposed Agreement will help enact one of the main objectives of the negotiations, namely the creation of a level playing field between all the EU and US air carriers, complemented by tight regulatory rules. The proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: cap and trade systems are policy tools that cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union has been implementing its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS-EU) for more than ten years. The development of a well-functioning international carbon market through bottom-up linking of emissions trading systems is a long term policy goal of the EU and the international community, notably as a means to achieve climate objectives, including under the Paris Agreement. Linking enhances the cost-efficiency of emissions trading. The Directive establishing the EU‚Äôs Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) allows for the EU ETS to be linked with other emissions trading systems provided they are mandatory, have an absolute cap on emissions and are compatible. In 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Switzerland for a link between the EU and the Swiss greenhouse gas emissions trading systems. Overall, the design of the Swiss ETS is very similar to that of the EU ETS: the same gases and industry sectors are covered, with equal inclusion thresholds; definition of the liable entities at installation level; compatible allocation methodologies; similarity of quantitative and qualitative standards for international credits; same compliance periods (2013-2020). In addition, like the EU ETS, the Swiss ETS is currently undergoing review for its next period from 2021 to 2030. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the agreement between the EU and Switzerland on the linking of their greenhouse gas emission allowance trading schemes. In concrete terms, the agreement:"

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union (EU) and Kazakhstan are currently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in Brussels on 23 January 1995, which entered into force in June 1999. On 13 April 2011, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the European Commission to negotiate the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan. Negotiation of the Agreement began in June 2011. The Agreement between the parties was signed on 21 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date. For the EU, the Agreement constitutes an important step towards increased political and economic involvement in Central Asia. By strengthening political dialogue and improving cooperation in a broad range of areas, it will provide the basis for more effective bilateral engagement with Kazakhstan. Legal nature: the Agreement was negotiated and initialled by the European Union and the Republic of Kazakhstan as the Union's Agreement only. As the European Union's Member States were unanimous in preferring a mixed Agreement, it was agreed to amend the initialled text of the Agreement and the Joint Proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission for a Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Agreement accordingly. In response to this measure, the European Commission made the following statement: ‚ÄòGiven the political and economic relevance of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with Kazakhstan, the Commission stresses the importance of signing and ratifying it swiftly. The Commission reiterates its position that a ""mixed"" agreement is legally unnecessary in the present case and that all matters covered by the agreement fall within the EU's competence. The Commission therefore regrets that the Member States insist on signing and ratifying the EPCA with Kazakhstan as a ""mixed"" agreement. The Commission reserves its position as to the future presentation of acts linked to the legal nature of an international agreement.‚Äô Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement, the Agreement was signed by the European Union and the Republic of Kazakhstan as a mixed Agreement. CONTENT: the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission jointly proposed that the Council adopt a Council Decision approving, on behalf of the European Union, the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Kazakhstan, of the other part. The text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision. The Agreement is based on three key points: ‚Äì Political dialogue and cooperation in the field of foreign and security policy: provisions are provided to set the political dialogue with this country as well as cooperation in the field of foreign and security policy. The Agreement includes the EU‚Äôs standard political clauses on human rights, the international criminal courts, weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light weapons and counterterrorism. Provisions are also laid down as regards: - Trade and business: a specific title is provided for: The Agreement contains a substantive trade section with important commitments in several trade policy areas. These will ensure a better regulatory environment for businesses in Kazakhstan, and thus bring substantial economic benefits for EU businesses. - Sectoral cooperation: a series of provisions on cooperation are provided in a wide range of areas: - Institutional framework: the Agreement sets up an institutional framework comprising the Cooperation Council, the Cooperation Committee and the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. It also introduces a procedure for settling disputes, to be used should one of the parties fail to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. Duration of the Agreement: the Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period, and can be terminated at six months‚Äô notice. As of its entry into force, the Agreement supersedes the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Kazakhstan, of the other part, signed on 23 January 1995."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan have been successfully concluded. The Agreement provides that single distilled shochu, as defined in the Liquor Tax Law of Japan, produced by pot still and bottled in Japan, shall be allowed to be placed on the market of the European Union in traditional bottles of sizes of four go and one sho, corresponding to nominal quantities of 720 ml and of 1800 ml, respectively, provided that other applicable legal requirements of the European Union are fulfilled. Directive 2007/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that spirit drinks put up in pre-packages may only be placed on the Union market if they are prepacked in the nominal quantities listed in section 1 of the Annex to that Directive. For spirit drinks, section 1 of the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC refers to nine nominal quantities on the interval from 100 ml to 2000 ml. These nominal quantities do not include 720 ml and 1800 ml, the nominal quantities in which single distilled shochu produced by pot still is bottled and marketed in Japan. A derogation from the nominal quantities set out in the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC for spirit drinks is therefore necessary to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the Union market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a trade sustainability impact assessment of the EPA between the EU and Japan was carried out by the external contractor ‚ÄúLondon School of Economics Enterprises‚Äù. The details of it are provided in Commission proposal for a Council Decision on the signing on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. CONTENT: the proposal aims at introducing a derogation from Union rules concerning bottle sizes, for single distilled shochu, a spirit drink produced by pot still and bottled in Japan that is traditionally sold in bottles of sizes of four go or one sho that correspond to nominal quantities of 720 ml (one go corresponds to 180 ml) and 1800 ml, respectively, and that are currently not among the nominal quantities permitted in the Union under Directive 2007/45/EC laying down rules on nominal quantities of prepacked products. This derogation needs to be introduced by an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the market in all Member States simultaneously upon the entry into force of the Agreement."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: since 2004, the European Union has set out to improve the performance of air traffic management (ATM) in Europe by reforming the way air traffic is managed and organised and also by modernising and harmonising the European ATM infrastructure through the Single European Sky (SES) initiative. Sharing the common goal to develop safer and more efficient air transport, in 2011, the European Union and the United States of America signed the Memorandum of Cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union in civil aviation research and development (MoC). The cooperative activities carried out so far under the MoC mainly address ATM particularly cooperation in the field of research and development (R&D) between SESAR and NextGen programme managed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Cooperation under the MoC, in particular between SESAR and NextGen, has reached a high level of maturity and has delivered important results in terms of promoting global interoperability of ATM systems. This led the two parties to explore the potential for extending the scope of cooperation to topics relating to the deployment of ATM systems. On this basis, the Council authorised the Commission on 8 May 2017 to negotiate with the FAA concerning an amendment to the MoC to extend its scope to cover deployment. The Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation NAT-I-9406 between the United States of America and the European Union was signed on 13 December 2017, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to authorise the entry into force of Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation NAT-I-9406 signed by the representatives of the Union and of the United States on the basis of a corresponding Council Decision. The Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation extends the scope of cooperation between the Parties to all phases of air traffic management modernisation, including deployment activities, with the goal of ensuring global interoperability and modifies the structure and governance of the Memorandum so as to optimise the implementation and management of the cooperative activities carried out thereunder. The research, development and validation activities related to the MoC will continue to be planned and monitored by the SESAR Joint Undertaking. The deployment activities will be planned and monitored by the SESAR Deployment Manager under the specific grant agreements signed with the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to United Nations estimates, the total amount of criminal proceeds in 2009 was approximately USD 2.1 trillion, or 3.6 % of global GDP. The size of proceeds from criminal activity in the main illicit markets in the European Union for which evidence is available, has been estimated to amount to EUR 110 billion. The cross-border dimension of money laundering and the need to address this phenomenon through judicial cooperation among Member States are confirmed by the number of cases registered by Member States and Liaison Prosecutors at Eurojust. The Commission considers that the current legislative framework is neither comprehensive nor sufficiently coherent to be fully effective. The differences in legal frameworks can be exploited by criminals and terrorists, who can choose to carry out their financial transactions where they perceive anti-money laundering measures to be weakest. At the operational level, the differences in the definitions, scope and sanctions of money laundering offences affect cross-border police and judicial cooperation between national authorities and the exchange of information. The European agenda on security adopted in April 2015 called for additional measures in the area of terrorist financing and money laundering. The Commission presented on 2 February 2016 an action plan to further step up the fight against the financing of terrorism. One of the key actions of the action plan was to consider a possible proposal for a Directive to introduce minimum rules regarding the definition of the criminal offence of money laundering (applying it to terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences) and to approximate sanctions. The European Parliament resolution of 25 October 2016 on the fight against corruption also pointed out that participation in criminal activities may be linked to terrorist crimes and called for a reinforcement of EU legislation on combating organised crime and money-laundering for the fight against terrorism to be effective. CONTENT: this proposal for a Directive aims to counter money laundering by means of criminal law. It aims to achieve this objective by implementing international obligations in this area and further aligning it with the International Standards on Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Proliferation adopted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The proposed Directive: establishes minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering offences: the proposal provides definitions of the term ""criminal activity"" which constitute predicate offences for money laundering, while allowing Member States to maintain different approaches as regards predicate offences for money laundering (choosing between an all-crimes approach, lists of predicate offences, list of offences with a minimum penalty); provides that the three types of money laundering (conversion or transfer, concealment or disguise, and acquisition, possession or use) should be criminalised when committed intentionally; requires Member States to criminalise forms of aiding and abetting, inciting and attempting many of the mentioned offences. Aiding and abetting a money laundering offence may include a large variety of activities that range from facilitating or providing counselling to the provision of supportive services for the commission of these acts; requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties and sets the minimum maximum penalty at four years of imprisonment, at least for serious cases; qualifies aggravating circumstances as when the offence was committed within a criminal organisation or when the perpetrator abused their professional position to enable money laundering, this is considered an aggravating circumstance; requires Member States to ensure the liability of legal persons, while that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons; aims at ensuring that investigative tools which are provided for in national law for organised crime or other serious crime cases can also be used in cases of money laundering."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Article 19 of the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA Agreement) contains provisions on trade in agricultural products. The 2007 EU-Iceland bilateral Agreement on trade preferences includes, among others, a commitment by the Parties to promote trade in products with geographical indications (GIs). The EU-Iceland GIs negotiations were conducted from 4 July 2012 to 17 September 2015. The negotiations were carried out in conjunction with the EU-Iceland negotiations on further liberalisation of trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products. The conclusion of the GIs Agreement with Iceland fits into the overall EU strategy of promoting the production and the consumption of EU products with GIs. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council adopt a decision, approving on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs. Under this Agreement, 1 150 EU foodstuff GIs will obtain a high level of direct protection in Iceland. The GIs will be protected against: Iceland has not yet registered any protected GI names. The Agreement provides, however, a mechanism for updating the GIs list and for including new GI names at a later stage through a Joint Committee process The EEA Agreement already provides for the mutual recognition and protection of geographical indications for wines, aromatised wine products and spirit drinks. Therefore the scope of this Agreement covers only agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines, aromatised wine products and spirit drinks. The GIs Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties have notified each other that their respective internal adoption procedures have been completed."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may only adopt the act with Parliament‚Äôs approval. BACKGROUND: the EU and Iceland are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement), which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the Parties will review efforts on the further reduction of any type of barriers to trade in the agricultural sector. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters entered into force on 1 January 2007. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations under Article 19 of the EEA Agreement in two years‚Äô time. The bilateral agricultural trade agreement of 2007 increased the duty-free access of Icelandic agricultural products to the EU market to 51.9 % of trade and increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Icelandic market to 66.4 % of trade. These figures demonstrate that there was ample room for further trade concessions. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations that took place on 4 July 2012, aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products. The Agreement was initialled by the Parties on 17 September 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Iceland concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. As a result almost 90 % of EU agricultural products will enter Iceland duty-free. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, fruit, vegetable and ornamental plants, additional tariff quotas or tariff reductions have been agreed upon. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Iceland will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal for repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No 685/2001 is submitted in the context of the Commission's REFIT programme and commitment on better regulation. The objective is to ensure a legislative framework that is fit for purpose and of high quality, as referred to in the Interinstitutional Agreement between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission on Better Law-Making. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89, Regulations (EC) No 2888/2000 and (EC) No 685/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council: Council Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89 introduced arrangements for structural improvements in the inland waterway sector for the fleets operating on the linked inland waterway networks of Belgium, Germany, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria. The objective of that Regulation was to reduce overcapacity in the inland waterway fleets by means of vessel-scrapping schemes coordinated at Community level. On 29 March 1999, Council Regulation (EC) No 718/1999 on a Community-fleet capacity policy to promote inland waterway transport was adopted in order to ensure that the appropriate tools continued to be available to the inland waterway transport sector and to manage the fleet capacity. This Regulation entered into force on 29 April 1999 to succeed to Regulation (EEC) No 1101/89; Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 concerns the distribution of quotas for heavy goods vehicles which the Community received from Switzerland for years 2001 to 2004 among its Member States. In accordance with the Agreement between the European Community and Switzerland on the Carriage of Goods and Passengers by Rail and Road and with effect from 1 January 2005, all vehicles meeting the technical standards of Directive 96/53/EC (that is to say, up to a maximum weight of 40 tonnes) shall be exempt from any quota or authorisation arrangements. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 2888/2000 should be repealed; Regulation (EC) No 685/2001 lays down the rules for the distribution between the Member States of authorisations available to the Community by virtue of the agreements between the European Community and Bulgaria and between the European Community and Romania establishing certain conditions for the carriage of goods by road and the promotion of combined transport. The Regulation has become obsolete as Bulgaria and Romania have acceded to the Union and as Member States they are no longer subject to a system of authorisations as far as access to the haulage market is concerned."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the new telecommunications package adopted today by the Commission includes a Communication setting out a European vision of Internet connectivity for citizens and business in the Digital Single Market, as well as a legislative proposal for a European Electronic Communications Code. The Commission proposal set out the reforms needed to ensure availability and take-up of very high capacity networks and ensure that no one and no region is left behind. One of the Commission's strategic aims for the Union to be achieved by 2025 is for sites at which public services are provided, such as public administrations, libraries and hospitals to be equipped with gigabit internet connections. The proposal complements this effort through amendments to the legal framework for telecommunications in the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), contained in Regulation (EU) No 1316/20133 and Regulation (EU) No 283/2014 on guidelines for trans-European networks in the area of telecommunications infrastructure. These amendments encourage entities with a public mission such as public authorities and providers of public services to offer free local wireless connectivity in the centres of local public life (e.g. public administrations, libraries, health centres and outdoor public spaces). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment carried out for the review of the regulatory framework builds on those considerations expressed by stakeholders and proposes to introduce provisions on the deployment of small cells. These provisions aim to reduce the costs of deploying very dense networks and to enhance access to local wireless connectivity in order to meet the exponential demand for ubiquitous connectivity. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014 in order to promote internet connectivity in local communities. Financial assistance : the proposal provides that entities with a public mission such as public authorities and providers of public services, wishing to offer free local wireless connectivity through local access points, will benefit from financial assistance. Funding to local public authorities for access points in the centres of local public life, including outdoor spaces accessible to the general public, will be prioritised in the first phase of the intervention. Targeted intervention : in order to ensure the targeted nature of the intervention and to realise maximum public benefit, funding will be limited to situations where no freely accessible public or private access points delivering very high-speed broadband exist. Furthermore, funding will be awarded in a geographically balanced manner that contributes to the economic, social and territorial cohesion in the Union by taking particular account of the needs of local communities. Rate of intervention : to ensure that local communities with limited resources can also experience these benefits of participation in the Digital Single Market, support under this measure should be available for up to 100 % of the eligible costs, without prejudice to the principle of co-financing. Projects of common interest : given its flexible and focussed nature relative to the support for broadband networks under the telecommunications sectoral envelope for the implementation of the CEF, the intervention should be recognised as a separate project of common interest with associated actions under the CEF Regulation and a dedicated budget, the details of which should be provided for under the Guidelines Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: a total budget of EUR 120 million is envisaged for the period until 2019. Appropriations required by the proposal are to be fully financed within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. EUR 70 million are to be reallocated within the programmed amounts for the CEF telecommunications sector 2017-2019 and EUR 50 million will be transferred to the financial envelope for the telecommunications sector through an amendment of Article 5(1) of the CEF Regulation. For reasons of consistency, this increase is also reflected in the proposal for an amendment of the legal framework for the European Fund for Strategic Investments."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply has already had a significant positive impact on the Union situation as regards the security of the gas supply, both in terms of preparation and mitigation. Member States are better prepared to face a supply crisis now that they are required to draw up plans including preventive and emergency measures, and they are better protected now that they have to meet a number of obligations regarding infrastructure capacity and gas supply. Five years after the adoption of Regulation 994/2010, the security of the gas supply remains a highly topical issue, given the tensions prevailing between Ukraine and Russia: the implementation report of Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 of October 2014 highlighted areas in which improvements to that Regulation could further bolster the Union supply security; the Commission's Communication on the short-term resilience of the European gas system from October 2014 analysed the effects of a partial or complete disruption of gas supplies from Russia and concluded that purely national approaches are not very effective in the event of severe disruption, given their scope, which is by definition limited. This stress test showed how a more cooperative approach among Member States could significantly reduce the impact of very severe disruption scenarios in the most vulnerable Member States; the Commission Communication 'Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union with a Forward-Looking Climate Change Policy' from February 2015, highlights the fact that the Energy Union rests on solidarity and trust, which are necessary features of energy security. The increasing interconnection of the EU gas markets and the 'corridor approach' for enabling the reverse flows on gas interconnectors call for coordinated measures. Cooperation should also be extended to specific measures to foster solidarity between Member States in security of supply matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Impact Assessment Board issued a positive opinion on 16 December 2015. Four policy options were examined and the option maintained consisted of ensuring a better coordination, with some principles/standards being set at EU level. This option: (i) will have a very limited overall impact on costs and prices; (ii) should be good for market participants and consumers; (iii) should help make the single energy market operate better. CONTENT: this draft Regulation seeks to replace Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 and ensure that all the necessary measures are taken to safeguard an uninterrupted supply of gas throughout the Union, in particular to protected customers in the event of difficult climatic conditions or disruptions of the gas supply. This Regulation establishes provisions aimed at safeguarding the security of gas supply by ensuring the proper and continuous functioning of the internal market in natural gas (""gas""), by: allowing for exceptional measures to be implemented when the market can no longer deliver the required gas supplies; providing for a clear definition and attribution of responsibilities among natural gas undertakings, the Member States and the Union regarding both preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply. To meet this objective, the draft regulation proposes stronger regional coordination, with certain principles and standards being set at EU level. The approach proposed is that: Member States should cooperate closely within their regions when conducting regional risk assessments; in order to ensure EU-wide consistency, regional risk assessments will be conducted on the basis of an EU-wide simulation, with common standards and a specific scenario; risks identified through regional risk assessments will be addressed in regional preventive action plans and emergency plans, to be peer-reviewed and approved by the Commission. To ensure that risk assessments and plans are comprehensive and consistent with one another, the Regulation sets out mandatory templates listing aspects that must be taken into account when conducting the risk assessment and drawing up the plans. The Regulation also: improves the application of the supply standard to protected customers (mainly households) and the infrastructure standard (the possibility of supplying gas even if the largest infrastructure is not available); enables permanent bi-directional capacity; proposes the introduction of additional transparency measures concerning gas supply contracts; as such contracts may affect security of supply in the EU. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR Regulation) implements in the EU the G20 commitment made in 2009 to increase the stability of the OTC derivatives market. The main objective of EMIR is to reduce systemic risk by increasing the transparency of the OTC derivatives market, through core requirements. They include: (i) central clearing; (ii) margin requirements; (iii) operational risk mitigation requirements; (iv) reporting obligations for derivative contracts; (v) requirements for central counterparties (CCPs); and (vi) requirements for trade repositories. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the EMIR report, which pointed to the need to eliminate disproportionate costs and burdens on small companies and to simplify rules without compromising financial stability. Accordingly, the proposal sets out a series of targeted amendments to the EMIR Regulation, in order to simplify the rules and ensure that the latter are more proportionate. At the same time the proposal maintains all key elements of the framework that have proved to allow achieving the objectives of EMIR. It is related to and consistent with the ongoing initiative to establish a Capital Markets Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysis the costs and benefits of areas of EMIR where targeted action could ensure fulfilment of the EMIR objectives in a more proportionate, efficient and effective manner. The analysis shows that it would be possible to obtain a reduction of costs and restrictions, and at the same time, simplify the Regulation. It is estimated that the combined effect of all preferred options, calculated solely for the purpose of the impact assessment, amount to cost reductions ranging from EUR 2.3 billion to EUR 6.9 billion in fixed (one-off) costs and from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.66 billion in operational costs. Overall, businesses, SMEs, and micro-enterprises will, in particular, benefit from (i) reducing regulatory requirements in cases where disproportionate compliance costs appear to outweigh prudential benefits and (ii) improving access to clearing. There should be no significant relevant social and economic cost. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in order to simplify the rules applicable to over the counter derivatives and make them more proportionate in order to reduce costs and regulatory burden weighing on market participants, without putting at risk financial stability. The proposal simplifies reporting requirements for all counterparties. It re-focuses the scope of the clearing obligation for financial counterparties to include some additional relevant market players while exempting the smallest financial counterparties. Specifically the proposal: removes the requirement to report historic transactions, i.e. transactions that were not outstanding on the starting date of the reporting obligation on 12 February 2014; introduces improvements to ensure the quality of reported data for trade repositories; establishes single-sided reporting by the central counterparties for exchange-traded derivatives transactions ('ETDs'); provides that, for transactions other than ETD transactions, the responsibility for reporting transactions between a small non-financial counterparty (i.e. not subject to the clearing obligation) and a financial counterparty should be on the financial counterparty to the trade; exempts intragroup transactions involving any non-financial counterparties from the reporting obligation; provides, with regards to non-financial counterparties, that only non-hedging contracts are counted towards the thresholds triggering the clearing obligation; introduces a new three‚Äìyear temporary exemption for pension funds from central clearing; increases the upper limit of basic amount of fines for infringements of EMIR requirements by trade repositories; clarifies the interaction between EMIR default management tools and national insolvency laws to ensure the insolvency remoteness of client assets; requires observance of the principle to provide clearing services under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms ('FRAND' principle). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : building on over twelve years of experience in the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, this initiative is part of the Commission‚Äôs 2015 ‚ÄòAviation Strategy to Enhance the Competitiveness of the EU Aviation Sector'. Its objective is to prepare the EU aviation safety regulatory framework for the challenges of the next ten to fifteen years and thus to continue to ensure safe, secure and environmentally friendly air transport for passengers and the general public. Safety and consideration for environmental protection are pre-requisites for a competitive aviation sector. With the aviation traffic in Europe predicted to reach 14.4 million flights in 2035 (50% more than in 2012), the Commission's objective is to make sure that the system continues to maintain the current low number of accidents, allowing the EU aviation sector to safely grow in the future and thus to contribute to its competitive edge. To this end, the proposal aims to: introduce a risk and performance based approach to safety regulation; close existing safety gaps , and better take into account interdependencies between aviation safety and other technical domains of regulation such as aviation security or environmental protection; contribute to a competitive European aviation industry and aeronautical manufacturing which generates high value-jobs and drives technological innovation; create a Union framework for safe integration of unmanned aircraft (drones) into the European airspace; introduce a scalable framework that recognises the differences existing between the various sectors of civil aviation and the risks involved therein. This approach is expected to benefit the whole aviation sector in the Union and will be particularly suited to the needs of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs); IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by two impact assessment reports. CONTENT: the proposal to revise the rules on aviation safety in the EU (Regulation 216/2008) aims to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in the Union, while ensuring a high uniform level of environmental protection. The main points are as follows: Scope: the present initiative proposes adding a limited number of specific areas to the overall Union aviation safety framework, namely unmanned aircraft, safety of ground handling services and security aspects of aircraft and aviation systems‚Äô design, including cybersecurity. Excluded from the scope of the legislation are aircraft that are of simple design or operate mainly on a local basis and those which are home-built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number. Certain aerodromes are exempt from the scope, such as those that are not open to public use and aerodromes mainly used for recreational flying or serving commercial air transport or those that do not fulfil certain minimum technical criteria related to the volume or scope of activities. Aviation Safety Management : a new chapter dealing with safety management is introduced, which requires the adoption of the European aviation safety programme and the European plan for aviation safety, and transposes ICAO Annex 19 standards and recommended practices related to state safety programmes. With regard to the European plan for aviation safety, the proposal introduces the concept of acceptable level of safety performance at Union level. The introduction of this concept does not result, however, in establishing any binding safety targets for the Union or its Member States. Substantive requirements : it is proposed that the provisions of the Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 dealing with airworthiness be revised, taking into account existing experience and reflecting the new concept of non-installed equipment (equipment carried on board of an aircraft but not installed in the aircraft and which may have an impact on safety). The scope of the provisions dealing with airworthiness certification is also extended to environmental compatibility of aeronautical products, but the Union would now be given the flexibility to adapt the ICAO standards to its specific needs, as is already the case for safety. For low risk operations, the possibility of assessing the airworthiness and environmental compatibility of the design of products and parts without the need to issue a certificate is being proposed. This option could be implemented especially for certain aircraft used in the general aviation sector. The certification requirement is now limited to commercial air transport operations. Other types of operations to be subject to a certification or declaration requirement are to be defined in the delegated acts based on a risk assessment. Aircrew: the scope of the articles is extended to include cabin crew and the relevant provisions on cabin crew from are moved to this section. The text concerning the leisure pilot licence has been simplified and the text concerning the general medical practitioner has been moved to Chapter IV, which deals with certification activities Operators : the certification requirement is now limited to commercial air transport operations. Other types of operations to be subject to a certification or declaration requirement are to be defined in the delegated acts based on a risk assessment. Aerodromes: Joint Oversight and Enforcement System : the new proposal contains, inter alia: a clear legal basis to empower the Commission to adopt, by means of delegated acts, requirements with respect to management systems of authorities, qualification of inspectors, conditions for conducting the inspections and other oversight activities, ramp inspections, and grounding of aircraft in case of non-compliance; a set of new provisions concerning cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States, the Commission and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency as regards certification, oversight and enforcement. A mechanism for pooling and sharing of aviation inspectors and other experts is introduced, along with a dedicated financing mechanism to assist Member States in cooperative oversight; a new provision for mitigating possible systemic safety oversight deficiencies identified at Member State. This emergency oversight mechanism is to be used as a measure of last resort of temporary nature; the possibility of accepting foreign certificates and similar documentation on the basis of conditions specified in delegated acts; clarification of the provisions on accreditation of qualified entities. It is proposed that qualified entities may be granted a privilege to issue, revoke, and suspend certificates on behalf of the Agency or national competent authority. The principle of recognition of accreditations of qualified entities is introduced; a legal basis for a new repository of information relevant for certification, oversight and enforcement activities, to be managed by the Agency. It is proposed that this repository is also used by the Member States for the purpose of exchanging information concerning medical fitness of pilots. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency : the proposal creates three new functions for the Agency (assistance to national competent authorities, support to the Commission in the implementation of aviation performance schemes, and cooperation with other Union bodies, such as the European Chemicals Agency or the European Defence Agency on technical matters related to civil aviation). The proposal: limits the responsibility of the Agency to approve organisations not established in the Union to organisations located outside the territory for which a Member State is responsible under the Chicago Convention; clarifies that fines are in principle to be imposed only if other enforcement measures would be inadequate or disproportionate; clarifies that the investigative powers of the Agency must be exercised in compliance with the applicable provisions of national law of the Member State where the investigation takes place; mandates the Agency to assist the Commission in identifying key research themes related to the areas covered by the Regulation; introduces an article focusing on interdependencies which may exist between aviation security measures (e.g. cockpit door locking systems) and aviation safety; sets out the role of the Agency in crisis management, provision of aviation training and the implementation of the Single European Sky; creates an Executive Board assisting the Management Board of the Agency. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has budgetary implications with regard to the budget of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency set out under article 06 02 02 of the Union budget. Total expenditure is estimated at: EUR 37.369 million in year N (beginning of the implementation of the proposal); EUR 37.839 million in year N+1; EUR 37.887 million EUR in year N+2; EUR 38.598 million in year N+3. The proposal introduces a number of new tasks for the Agency with consequences for its need for posts financed from the Union contribution. The human resources required will partially be met by present staff through their redeployment, thus reducing the need of the Agency for additional staff financed from budget related to the Union contribution to 5 posts and 4 contract agents. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its climate and energy framework for 2030, the EU is committed to reducing its emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. The Commission‚Äôs 2016 European Strategy for low-emission mobility set the objective of at least a 60 % reduction in emissions from transport by 2050 compared to 1990 levels. In 2014, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) represented 5 % of total EU emissions, a fifth of all transport emissions and about a quarter of road transport emissions and they are set to increase by 2030. At present, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption from new HDVs placed on the Union market are not subject to any certification, monitoring or reporting requirements. The Commission wishes to fill this knowledge gap with a view to ensuring full market transparency and that European citizens and business have access to fair, sustainable and competitive mobility. This proposal implements the 2014 Communication on a strategy for reducing Heavy-Duty Vehicles‚Äô fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. This strategy announced an implementing measure setting out the procedure for the certification of CO2 emissions from new HDVs placed on the EU market, calculated by the Vehicle Energy Consumption calculation Tool (VECTO), and a legislative proposal on monitoring and reporting these emissions. This tool may be used to calculate the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of new heavy-duty vehicles in a comparable and cost-effective manner. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the chosen option imposes monitoring and reporting obligations on Member States and manufacturers. The designated national authorities would report annually to the Commission the registration data of new registered vehicles, in particular vehicle identification numbers, VINs. Vehicle manufacturers would submit the monitoring data corresponding to those vehicles to the Commission. On the basis of the VIN numbers, the two datasets would be combined by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in order to obtain monitoring data at a Member State level. The selected option is likely to generate competition to produce more energy-efficient vehicles and incentives to innovation. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down the requirements for the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from and fuel consumption of new heavy-duty vehicles (lorries, buses and coaches) registered in the European Union. In concrete terms, the proposal: specifies the categories of vehicles for which registration data, technical data and, where available, the CO2 emission and fuel consumption data should be monitored and reported; imposes a series of obligations on the Member States concerning the monitoring and reporting timetable, the designation of the competent authorities and the data to be monitored. These data - collected annually from 2020 onwards - would in particular concern new heavy-duty vehicles and new trailers registered for the first time in the Union, or registered outside the Union but less than three months before registration in the Union; sets out the essential obligations imposed on manufacturers with regard to the monitoring and reporting timetable, the designation of contact points and the data to be monitored; obliges the Commission to maintain a central register collecting data. The register will be maintained by the EEA. While the majority of data records should be publicly available, certain data may not be disclosed due to the need to protect private data (vehicle identification numbers), and competition reasons (names of component manufacturers); provides that entities reporting data would be responsible for the quality and accuracy of the data submitted, with the Commission reserving the right to verify and, where appropriate, to correct the final data. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/20076 has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity. A codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it, fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also necessary to make certain substantive amendments to that Regulation in order to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts and to adapt the rules on the exceptional measures with limited territorial application. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast. Purpose of the Regulation : to recall, this Regulation applies the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements. It shall apply to products originating in the regions and states listed in Annex I. It calls for more favourable access to the EU market rules for a number of products defined in the Regulation (notably the elimination of import duties on the Community market if they originate from regions or states listed in Annex I of the Regulation). Such elimination shall be subject to the general safeguards mechanisms. The Regulation also sets the rules for defining the origin of the products from the regions or States concerned. However, these measures are subject to changes under the present proposal. Exceptional measures with limited territorial application : the Commission may, after having examined alternative solutions, authorise the application of surveillance or safeguard measures restricted to the Member State or Member States concerned if it considers that such measures applied at that level are more appropriate than measures applied throughout the Union. Those measures must be strictly limited in time and must disrupt the operation of the internal market as little as possible. Delegated acts : according to the proposal, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding an Annex to this Regulation which sets out the regime applicable to products originating in South Africa once the relevant trade provisions of the TDCA have been superseded by the relevant provisions of an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, an Economic Partnership Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate granted to it by the Council, the European Commission on behalf of the Union negotiated with the Government of Denmark and Government of Greenland in view of renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and these two territorial entities. Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 20 March 2015. The new Protocol is in line with the objectives of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, strengthens the cooperation between the Union and Greenland and promotes a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Greenlandic fishing zone in the interest of both Parties. CONTENT: with this proposal for a Decision, the Commission proposes the conclusion of a protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other. Period of application: the Fishing Protocol would cover a period of five years from the date of provisional application ‚Äì i.e. from the date of its signature and from 1 January 2016 at the earliest. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol grants fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the fishing zone of Greenland, in line with relevant conservation and management measures and within the limits of the available surplus. To this effect, the protocol sets an indicative annual level of fishing opportunities granted by Greenland (in tonnes) to Union vessels by species: Following results to be assessed by the ICES Advisory Committee on the ongoing investigations and surveys at sea carried out on the different components of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Greenland waters and more particularly on spawners located West Greenland inshore, West Greenland offshore and East Greenland offshore, the Joint Committee may revise or adjust the indicative fishing opportunities for cod. Financial contribution: the Protocol provides for a total annual financial contribution of EUR 17.799.978 per year for its duration. This amount corresponds to: The two Parties have agreed to cooperate to implement Greenlandic sectorial fisheries policy and to that end shall continue the policy dialogue on the relevant programming. Specific provisions: provision is made for the setting of principles for responsible fisheries management. Provision is also made for an experimental fisheries programme for species not included in the protocol, as well as scientific cooperation on sustainable fishery exploitation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called ‚ÄúOpen Skies‚Äù cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council granted the Commission a mandate to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing agreements with an agreement at Union level (the ‚Äúhorizontal mandate‚Äù). The objectives of such agreements are to give all European Union air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and to bring bilateral air service agreements between Member States and third countries in line with the law of the Union. In accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ‚Äùhorizontal mandate‚Äù, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the breeding of domestic animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species, and to a lesser extent the breeding of animals of other species, occupy an important place in Union agriculture and is a source of income for the agricultural community. The breeding of animals of those species is best encouraged if purebred breeding animals or hybrid breeding pigs of recorded high genetic quality are used. Member States have thus consistently endeavoured, as part of their agricultural policy, to promote, sometimes through public investment, the production of livestock of particular genetic characteristic that meets defined performance standards. Disparities between those standards have the potential to create technical barriers to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union. At present Union zootechnical legislation consists of four species specific (vertical) basic acts laying down the fundamental principles, concerning breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species. Technical requirements of identical nature for acceptance of breeding animals for breeding are currently regulated in three Council Directives and a Commission Decision. A horizontal Directive, complemented by implementing measures, provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals and their germinal products. Lastly, a specific Council Decision provides rules on the designation of a reference centre for breeding of bovine animals. CONTENT: the proposed regulation provides in a single legal framework the principles relating to: the approval or recognition and listing of breeding organisations, breeders associations and private undertakings, the registration and classification of animals in herd-books, flock-books, studbooks and, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs in registers, performance testing and genetic evaluation, the content and format of zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their semen, ova and embryos. In addition, the proposal provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and the designation of reference centres for breeding of animals. Provisions are laid down in this Regulation to carry out official controls and zootechnical checks and to resolve disputes arising where zootechnical checks disclose non-compliance with zootechnical requirements. However, the rules hereby proposed mirror those laid down in the Commission proposal for a new Regulation on official controls that is currently discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Commission will closely follow the evolution of the discussions on the two texts, and will make the necessary proposals in due time in order to ensure that the provisions on official controls in the field of zootechnics are included in the forthcoming Regulation on official controls. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: total freight transport in the EU has increased by almost 25 % over the last 20 years, and is projected to further increase by 51 % during 2015-2050. All this movement of goods is accompanied by a large amount of information being exchanged among a variety of parties, in both the private and the public domain. Today, this information is mostly printed on paper, in a variety of standard format documents. The fragmented legislation and the resulting lack of acceptance by authorities discourage investment in digital solutions for electronic documents. Yet the digitalisation of information exchange has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of transport and therefore to contribute to the smooth functioning of the single market. The Commission has acknowledged the need to foster acceptance and use of electronic transport documents in a number of policy initiative. The case for intervention has also been recognised by a wide range of stakeholders. This initiative is part of the third ‚ÄòEurope on the Move‚Äô Package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a full obligation for Member State authorities to accept regulatory cargo transport information or documentation, with partially harmonised implementation. The main expected benefits are of an economic and environmental nature. The industry is expected to make savings worth EUR 20-27 billion over 2018-2040, compared to a scenario where no policy intervention at EU level is made (the baseline), thanks to reduction in administrative costs (i.e. costs related to the management and exchange of transport information and documentation). This is equivalent to 75-102 million hours saved yearly. Road transport operators, 99% of which are SMEs, are expected to benefit of about 60% of all industry administrative costs savings. Positive environmental impacts are also expected, due to a decrease in road transport‚Äôs modal share in 2030 relative to the baseline. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation contains measures to: ensure that the obligation for all competent public authorities to accept electronic freight documents/information is in place in all EU Member States; ensure that the authorities implement the obligation of acceptance in a uniform manner; ensure the interoperability of the IT systems and solutions used for the electronic exchange of freight transport information, and in particular for business-to-administration (B2A) regulatory information communication. Concretely, the proposal: lays down requirements relative to the electronic format in which regulatory transport information (eFTI) should be made available by the economic operators concerned; establishes the obligation of the Member States‚Äô competent authorities of regulatory information made available electronically by the economic operators concerned in compliance with the conditions provided that such information meets the requirements guaranteeing its authenticity, integrity, security, etc; requires the competent authorities, eFTI services providers and economic operators concerned to take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information processed and exchanged in accordance with this Regulation; establishes the obligation of the Commission to adopt implementing acts establishing a common data set and subsets in relation the regulatory requirements under the scope of this Regulation, and laying down common procedures and rules for access to and processing by the competent authorities of regulatory information provided electronically; sets out the functional requirements for the eFTI platforms by the means of which the regulatory information could be made available by the economic operators concerned, and empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts laying detailed rules for their implementation. The proposal contains provisions on powers delegated to the Commission to amend non-essential elements in Annex 1 to this Regulation, where the regulatory information requirements falling under the scope of this Regulation are listed."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) is the only legally binding multilateral agreement in the field of personal data protection. Convention 108 requires the Parties to incorporate into their respective national laws the necessary measures to ensure respect for the human right of all individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. At present, 51 States have ratified Convention 108, including all 28 EU Member States. Convention 108 was opened for signature in 1981, long before the era of the internet and electronic communications. The development of technology and globalisation of information poses new challenges in the field of protection of personal information. On 31 May 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to participate on behalf of the Union in the negotiations on the modernisation of the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data (EST 108) and the conditions and modalities of accession of the Union to the modernised Convention. The Protocol amending Convention 108 (the amending Protocol) was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 18 May 2018 and will be open for signature as of 25 June 2018. The amending Protocol aims to widen the scope, increase the level and improve the effectiveness of data protection afforded under Convention 108. Given that the Union cannot sign or ratify the amending Protocol, as under the current Convention 108 only States are Parties, Member States should therefore be authorised to ratify the amending Protocol, acting jointly in the interests of the Union. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to authorise Member States to ratify, in the interest of the European Union, the Protocol amending the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS No 108) (the amending Protocol) insofar as its provisions fall within Union competence."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: ECRIS is an electronic system for exchanging information on previous convictions handed down against a specific person by criminal courts in the EU for the purposes of criminal proceedings against a person and, if so permitted by national law, for other purposes. The system is based on Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA and Council Decision 2009/316/JH. The ECRIS legal framework, however, does not sufficiently cover the particularities of requests concerning third country nationals. Although it is now possible to exchange information on third country nationals (TCN) through ECRIS, there is no procedure or mechanism in place to do so efficiently. The recent terrorist attacks demonstrated in particular the urgency of enhancing relevant information-sharing, notably as regards the extension of ECRIS to third country nationals. The Commission recalls that efficient cooperation between Member States and exchange of information extracted from criminal records of convicted persons is a necessary cornerstone of a properly functioning common area of justice and security. The European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council of Ministers have stated on several occasions the importance of improving ECRIS. The Riga Statement of 29 January 2015 issued by the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers stressed that exchanging information on criminal convictions is important in any strategy to combat crime and counter terrorism. Improving ECRIS is also part of the European Agenda on Security. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy alternatives were examined. The preferred option is legislation on a search mechanism to identify Member States holding criminal record information on TCN consisting of identity data of convicted TCN (index-filter) that can be searched by a hit-/no-hit search mechanism. The decentralised index-filter that would be anonymised and distributed to all other Member States enabling them to search at their own premises is the preferred option because it offers a mechanism to identify efficiently which Member States hold criminal record information on a particular TCN. As regards fingerprints , the sub-options preferred is that fingerprints should be included in the identification data to be stored in the person's criminal record and in the index-filter. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA, as regards the exchange of information on third country nationals and as regards the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), and replacing Council Decision 2009/316/JHA. The objectives are: to improve information exchange in criminal matters with regard to TCN; to reduce crime and foster crime prevention (also with regard to terrorism); to ensure equal treatment of TCN and EU nationals with regard to an efficient exchange of criminal record information. The main amendments proposed are as follows: Purpose: to improve the exchange of information on convictions of TCN, the purpose of the instrument now includes an obligation of the convicting Member State to store criminal record information on a TCN, including fingerprints. The definition of ‚Äòconvicting Member State‚Äô: this now covers convictions, irrespective of whether they were handed down against a national of another Member State or a TCN. Obligations of the convicting Member State : the Framework Decision is amended to ensure that Member States‚Äô obligation to add the nationality (or nationalities) of a convicted person to the criminal record now also applies to the nationality or nationalities of TCN. The proposal imposes the following obligations of a Member State as regards convictions on TCN handed down in its territory: an obligation to store criminal record information; an obligation to distribute to the other Member States an anonymised index-filter with identity information on the TCN convicted in its territory for the purpose of identifying the Member States holding criminal record information on a TCN; and the obligation to update the index-filter in line with any deletion or alteration of the data included in it. A Member State complies with the storage obligation even if the information is stored in another database than the criminal record database, as long as the central authority has access to the database in which the information is stored. Furthermore, the obligation applies regardless of whether a person also holds an EU nationality in order to ensure that the information can be found whether or not the additional nationality is known. Request for information on convictions : a Member State is obliged to supplement an extract of a criminal record for which a TCN has asked (his/her own record) with information from the other Member States in the same way that it would for EU nationals. Response to a request for information on convictions : a request for information on a TCN is treated similarly to a request for information on EU nationals. Accordingly, the requested central authority has to transmit information on a conviction handed down in its Member State against the TCN plus any convictions handed down in third countries that have been entered in its criminal record. Personal data: the references to personal data are extended to the new provisions on TCN. Format and organisational arrangements : the proposal: provides that central authorities of Member States shall transmit the information, the index-filter, requests, replies and other relevant information electronically using ECRIS and a standardised format in accordance with the standards laid down in implementing acts; sets out the technical obligations of Member States in relation to the tasks to be fulfilled by the Directive. This concerns both the current information exchange system and the new ‚Äòhit‚Äô/‚Äòno hit‚Äô system based on an anonymised index-filter. The technical and administrative arrangements for facilitating the exchange of information will be set out in implementing acts; governs the transmission of information if ECRIS is not available; requires Member States to notify the Commission instead of the Council in future when they are able to use ECRIS and the new index-filter. European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS): a new Article incorporates the main points contained in Council Decision 2009/316/JHA, which established ECRIS, in order to organise the exchange of information from criminal records between the Member States. Comitology: a comitology procedure has been introduced to give the Commission the necessary tools in order to implement the technical aspects of the exchange of information so it will work in practice. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the financial envelope for the implementation of the Directive for the period January 2017 to December 2020 is EUR 10 760 000. It is compatible with the current Multi-annual Financial Framework and costs will be met through the Justice programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union has taken a number of actions to increase resilience and enhance its cybersecurity preparedness. Since the first EU Cybersecurity Strategy adopted in 2013, important developments have taken place, including the second mandate for the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and the adoption of the Directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive), which form the basis for the present proposal. In 2016 the European Commission adopted a Communication on Strengthening Europe's Cyber Resilience System, in which further measures were announced to increase the EU‚Äôs resilience and preparedness. The Council recalled that the ENISA Regulation is one of the core elements of an EU cyber resilience framework and called upon the Commission to take further steps to address issue of certification at the European level. In 2017, it welcomed the Commission's intention to review the Cybersecurity Strategy in September and to propose further targeted actions before the end of 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment sought to mitigate problems such as the fragmentation of policies and approaches to cybersecurity across Member States; dispersed resources and fragmentation of approaches to cybersecurity across EU institutions, agencies and bodies; insufficient awareness and information of citizens and companies, coupled with the growing emergence of multiple national and sectoral certification schemes. The analysis led to the conclusion that a reformed ENISA in combination with an EU general ICT cybersecurity certification framework was the preferred option. CONTENT: overall, the proposal reviews the current mandate of ENISA and lays down a renewed set of tasks and functions, with a view to effectively and efficiently supporting Member States, EU institutions and other stakeholders' efforts to ensure a secure cyberspace in the European Union. The new proposed mandate seeks to give the Agency a stronger and more central role, in particular by also supporting Member States in implementing the NIS Directive and to counter particular threats more actively (operational capacity) and by becoming a centre of expertise supporting Member States and the Commission on cybersecurity certification. Specially, it proposal seeks to establish: an EU Cybersecurity Agency, building on the European Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), which will improve coordination and cooperation across Member States and EU institutions, agencies and bodies; an EU cybersecurity certification framework that will ensure the trustworthiness of the billions of devices (‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù) which drive today‚Äôs critical infrastructures, such as energy and transport networks, and also new consumer devices, such as connected cars. An EU Cybersecurity Agency : the Agency will be given a permanent mandate to assist Member States in effectively preventing and responding to cyber-attacks. It will improve the EU's preparedness to react by organising yearly pan-European cybersecurity exercises and by ensuring better sharing of threat intelligence and knowledge through the setting up of Information Sharing and Analyses Centres. It will help implement the Directive on the Security of Network and Information Systems which contains reporting obligations to national authorities in case of serious incidents. The Cybersecurity Agency would also help put in place and implement the EU-wide certification framework that the Commission is proposing to ensure that products and services are cyber secure. The proposal also includes the provisions facilitating the combating of fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities as well as staffing and budget provisions. An EU cybersecurity certification framework : at present, a number of different security certification schemes for ICT products exist in the EU. The Cybersecurity Agency, ENISA, will put in place and implement this certification process. The proposed EU-wide certification framework creates a comprehensive set of rules, technical requirements, standards and procedures to agree each scheme. Each scheme will be based on agreement at EU level for the evaluation of the security properties of a specific ICT-based product or service e.g. smart cards. The proposal establishes the main legal effects of European cybersecurity certification schemes, namely (i) the obligation to implement the scheme at national level and the voluntary nature of certification; (ii) the invalidating effect of European cybersecurity certification schemes on national schemes for the same products or services. It also lays down the procedure for the adoption of European cybersecurity certification schemes and the respective roles of the Commission, ENISA and the European Cybersecurity Certification Group. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total appropriations for ENISA, including administrative expenditure, from 2019 to 2022 is estimated at EUR 86.038 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with council. BACKGROUND: recent events have demonstrated the potential risks associated with the illicit use of personal data in relation to electoral processes and democracy. In 2018, the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica case concerning the alleged unlawful processing of user personal data acquired from Facebook by the company Cambridge Analytica raised serious concerns on the impact of data protection infringements on electoral processes. Investigations are ongoing in relation to this particular case, inter alia by the UK data protection supervisory authority which is leading the European investigation. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened an investigation on the case. A series of hearings took place in the European Parliament on the case and its impact on individuals‚Äô personal data in the Union Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1141/2014 established a specific European legal status for European political parties and European political foundations and provides for their funding from the general budget of the European Union. It also establishes an Authority for European political parties and European political foundations. This Authority is in particular responsible for examining cases in which these entities are suspected of not respecting European fundamental values. However, the existing rules do not effectively dissuade and sanction abuses of data protection rules which may affect the democratic debate and free elections. The Commission feels it is necessary to protect the integrity of the European democratic process by providing for financial sanctions in situations where European political parties and European political foundations take advantage of infringements of data protection rules with a view to influencing the outcome of elections to the European Parliament. CONTENT: in order to ensure that the elections to the European Parliament take place under strong democratic rules and in full respect of the European values of democracy, rule of law and respect of fundamental rights, the Commission is proposing a targeted amendment to Regulation No 1141/2014. It aims to allow financial sanctions on European political parties or foundations that use infringements of data protection rules to deliberately influence or attempt to influence the outcome of elections to the European Parliament. The proposal provides that a verification procedure is established whereby the Authority must, in certain circumstances, ask the committee of independent eminent persons to assess whether a European political party or a European political foundation has deliberately influenced or attempted to influence the outcome of elections to the European Parliament by taking advantage of an infringement of the applicable rules on protection of personal data. Where the committee finds that to be the case, the Authority should impose effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. Any party or foundation found guilty of a violation may not apply for funding from the general budget of the European Union for the year in which the sanction was imposed. The Authority shall request the opinion without undue delay and no later than 1 month after the decision of the supervisory authority. The committee shall deliver its opinion within a short, reasonable deadline set by the Authority. Since the new verification procedure is triggered by a decision of a competent data protection supervisory authority, it is proposed to allow for the review of the sanction if the competent data protection supervisory authority‚Äôs decision is repealed or where a remedy against such decision has been successful. Lastly, in order to enable the Authority to operate in an independent and effective manner, the Commission proposes that the latter has its own permanent staff and proposes also to confer the powers of an appointing authority on the Director of the Authority. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: to ensure the effectiveness of this proposal, the Authority will be provided with more permanent staff to the extent that additional tasks are entrusted to it. The financial impact is estimated at EUR 10.1 million (EUR 1.43 million per year). More permanent staffing provisions will be made through the redeployment of existing resources, and will require the modification of the establishment plans of the contributing institutions. Therefore, these elements will be included in the forthcoming Amending Letter to Draft Budget 2019."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 31 March 2016, the Council adopted negotiating directives which authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the European Union, an international agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the delegations from Canada, China, Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Russia and the United States of America with a view to concluding a binding Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. The Agreement seeks to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean, an area that is roughly 2.8 million square kilometres in size. Commercial fishing has never been known to occur in this area, nor is it likely to occur in the near future. However, given the changing conditions of the Arctic Ocean, the governments in question developed this Agreement in accordance with the precautionary approach to fisheries management. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. Becoming a Party to the Agreement will promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long term conservation and sustainable use of marine biological resources globally. The Agreement will establish and operate a joint programme of scientific research and monitoring with the aim of improving the understanding of the ecosystem(s) of this area and, in particular, of determining whether fish stocks might exist in this area that could be harvested on a sustainable basis. Once entered into force, the Agreement will close an important regulatory gap in the current International ocean governance framework."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: fraud affecting the EU's financial interests is a cross-border phenomenon affecting all EU Member States. Experience shows that the Union's financial interests are impacted by both fraud and irregularities. The implementation of the past Union multi-annual budgets has been accompanied by a set of measures to support the Member States and the Union as a whole in preventing and fighting fraud affecting the Union's financial interests, and supporting mutual administrative assistance and cooperation in customs and agriculture matters. These measures include: the Hercule III spending programme which supports activities against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union; the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS) which is an operational activity consisting essentially in a set of customs IT applications operated under a common information system managed by the Commission; the Irregularity Management System (IMS) which is a secure electronic communications tool which facilitates the Member States' obligation to report detected irregularities, including fraud, and which supports the management and analysis of these. Although it is difficult to quantify their financial impact, these measures have contributed to bringing back large amounts of money into the EU budget. For example, Hercule funded the development of the Automated Monitoring Tool (AMT), an IT tool that identifies anomalies in trade flows and was instrumental in identifying large undervaluation fraud schemes in the import of textile and footwear from third countries in 2017. This proposal aims at streamlining the financial support for these tools, for the duration of the next multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027. The Commission stressed that the next multiannual financial framework shall be implemented against the background of significant changes in the legislative and institutional framework for the protection of the Union's financial interests, in particular with the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office and the implementation of Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and the Council on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the EU anti-fraud programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme is intended to replace the Hercule III programme and shall have a budget of EUR 181 million for the period 2021-2027. Its general objectives shall be to protect the financial interests of the Union and to support mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. The specific objectives of the programme shall be threefold: assist Member States and the European Union to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the EU's financial interests, by financing activities (technical assistance and training) which otherwise might not be available at national level (EUR 114.2 million); support the reporting of irregularities, including fraud, with regard to the shared management and pre-accession assistance funds of the Union budget (EUR 7 million); provide tools for information exchange and support for operational activities in the field of mutual administrative assistance in customs and agricultural matters (EUR 60 million). Implementation : the proposal specifies how the programme shall be implemented through grants, including the possible beneficiaries of the grants. The latter include public authorities which are likely to contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives of the programme, from any of the following countries: a Member State or an overseas country or territory linked to it, a third country associated with the programme or a third country listed in a work programme. The programme shall be implemented by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The objectives of the CFP are, inter alia, to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally sustainable in the long term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. For the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, a number of conservation measures are to be adopted as appropriate in any combination thereof, such as multi-annual plans, technical measures, fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities. The fisheries of the Western Waters and adjacent areas are highly complex , involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. Council Regulations (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) 509/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008 and (EC) No 1342/2008 set out the rules for the exploitation of the northern stock of hake, hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and by the Western Iberian Peninsula, sole in the Bay of Biscay, sole in the Western Channel, herring in the West of Scotland and cod in the Kattegat, the North Sea in the West of Scotland and the Irish Sea. These and other demersal stocks are taken in mixed fisheries. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a single multi-annual plan taking into account such technical interactions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three legislative options examined, a single multi-annual plan for mixed fisheries covering all Western Waters has been chosen. This option received the highest scores on the following criteria: (i) effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) reduction of administrative burden; (iii) achievement of the overall main objectives of the CFP; (iv) providing a management framework that promotes stability and predictability. CONTENT: in accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources and with specific regards to the Basic Regulation which require the development of multi-annual plans, the main elements of the plan are: Scope : the scope of the plan is demersal stocks, including deep-sea stocks, in the Western Waters and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. The plan also covers implementation of the landing obligation and technical measures for all stocks and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in the Western Waters. Objectives : the plan shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular by applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and shall aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The plan shall contribute to: (i) the elimination of discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and to the implementation of the landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which this Regulation applies; (ii) implementing the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised. Targets : objectives and targets should be quantifiable. The proposed targets are expressed as fishing mortality ranges around FMSY as advised by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). These FMSY ranges allow for a maximum sustainable yield-based management for the stocks concerned, and appear to allow for adaptations in case of changes in the scientific advice, while at the same time preserving a high level of predictability. Safeguard measures : safeguards and specific conservation measures are linked to the conservation reference points. Appropriate safeguard measures should be envisaged in case the stock size falls below these levels. Safeguard measures should include the reduction of fishing opportunities and specific conservation measures when scientific advice states that remedial measures are needed. The plan provides for the periodic assessment of the impact on the stocks concerned, on the basis of scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a third of the EU's land suffers from water stress all year round and water scarcity remains an important concern for many EU Member States. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, including severe droughts, are also likely to have negative consequences on both the quantity and quality of freshwater resources. Between 1976 and 2006, the number of areas and people affected by droughts went up by almost 20% and the total costs of droughts amounted to EUR 100 billion (EC, 2012). Agricultural irrigation by far is the largest application of reused water worldwide and in Europe and a significant use of water in Europe, overall accounting for around a quarter of total freshwater abstracted. By encouraging the reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation, the EU could therefore improve its capacity to respond to increasing pressures on water resources. The need to address the problem at EU level has been acknowledged in the 2012 Commission Communication ‚ÄòA Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources‚Äô. A Fitness check of EU Freshwater policy published in November 2012 as a building block of the Blueprint, concluded that ‚Äòalternative water supply options with low environmental impact need to be further relied upon‚Äô in order to address water scarcity. Furthermore, the European Parliament, in its September 2015 Resolution on the follow-up to the European Citizens‚Äô Initiative Right2Water encouraged the Commission to draw up a legislative framework on water reuse. Two instruments in force in the Union encourage the reuse of water, without however specifying the conditions in this respect. These are the Water Framework Directive ( 2000/60/EC ) and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option for agricultural irrigation is a legal instrument with a ‚Äòfit for purpose‚Äô approach (minimum requirements set depending on the food crop category and irrigation technique) and protection of local public health and of the environment (the key risk management tasks). It is estimated that the proposed instrument could lead to 6.6 billion m3 of water per year being reused for agricultural irrigation, compared to 1.7 billion m3 if the EU did not establish a legal framework. CONTENT: the Regulation proposed by the Commission aims to mitigate water shortages in the EU, in the context of adaptation to climate change. It would ensure that treated waste water for agricultural irrigation is safe, protecting people and the environment. More specifically, the proposal: defines the minimum water quality and monitoring requirements to be met and the obligation to perform certain essential risk management tasks in order to enable the safe reuse of urban waste water as part of integrated water management. These requirements should consist of a minimum of parameters for reclaimed water and other stricter or additional quality requirements, imposed, if necessary, by the competent authorities together with appropriate preventive measures; defines the process of risk management that should be carried out by the operator of a reclamation plant in cooperation with relevant parties (the end-user of the reclaimed water, the urban waste water treatment plant supplying water to the reclamation plant, etc.). The reclamation plant operator shall elaborate a water reuse risk management plan identifying additional requirements to further mitigate risks, which would be part of a permit issued by the competent authority; ensure transparency and access to information in order to increase user and public confidence in the safety of reused water: the public will have access to information online about water reuse practice in their Member States. With regard to access to justice, it should be possible for citizens and NGOs to legally review the decisions taken by Member States under this Regulation. The proposed Regulation sets the date of entry into force and the date of application, i.e. one year after the date of entry into force in order to provide sufficient time to the Member States to adapt to the Regulation, as well as to elaborate an implementing act ensuring the uniform application of the risk management."

BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements applying to agricultural and forestry vehicles are set out in Directive 2003/37/EC and its implementing Directives, which have been repealed with effect from 1 January 2016 and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 and its four delegated acts and one implementing act. The Commission wishes to upgrade to technical progress Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 by updating certain requirements and correcting certain editorial errors following feedback received by stakeholders and Member States in the first implementation period. More precisely, it is necessary to introduce clarifications to two definitions of tractor categories and corrects certain terms important for the uniform application of the Regulation without possible interpretations. Moreover, there is a continuous need to update elements of these delegated acts to technical progress. However, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 limited the Commission‚Äôs powers to adopt delegated acts for a period of five years, which will expire on 21 March 2018. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 aims to: clarify the descriptions of T1 and T2 category vehicles regarding the position of the axle closest to the driver for tractors with reversible driving position and regarding the method of calculating the height of the centre of gravity. In order to accurately and uniformly establish the height of the centre of gravity for T2 category vehicles, reference should be made to internationally applicable standards which determine the centre of gravity of a tractor; extend the power conferred on the Commission to adopt delegated acts for 5 more years and sets out its tacit renewal, unless the Council or the European Parliament expressly object to it. The Commission has already received requests from stakeholders and Member States to extend this power."

This figure almost doubled compared to a decade ago. Postings have increased by 68% from 2010 to 2.3 million in 2016. There are 1.4 million EU citizens commuting to work in another Member State. There are also over 2 million workers in the road transport sector who cross intra-EU borders on a daily basis to transport goods or passengers. The European Pillar of Social Rights ‚Äì proclaimed jointly by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017 - sets out a number of key principles and rights to support fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems. Ensuring fair labour mobility in Europe is central to this objective. As outlined in their Joint Declaration on the legislative priorities for 2018-2019, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are committed to taking action to reinforce the social dimension of the Union, by working on improving the coordination of social security systems, by protecting workers from health risks in the workplace, by ensuring fair treatment for all in the Union labour market through modernised rules on posting of workers, and by further improving cross-border enforcement of the Union law. In this context, the Commission proposes the creation of a ""European Labour Authority"" to ensure that EU rules on worker mobility are observed in a fair, simple and effective manner. This initiative will complement and facilitate the implementation of ongoing initiatives aimed at ensuring fair mobility, including through the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive and of the lex specialis on the posting of workers in international road transport operations and the modernisation of EU provisions on the coordination of social security systems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy options were considered for the proposed Authority, these being a support option, an operational option, and a supervisory option. The operational option to be performed through a new Authority that builds on existing EU level mobility bodies turned out to be the most effective way to meet the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal for a regulation aims at setting up a European Labour Authority, in the form of a decentralised EU agency, to help individuals, businesses and national administrations to make the most of the opportunities offered by free movement and to ensure a level playing field for workers' mobility. The Authority has three objectives: 1. facilitate access for individuals and employers to information on their rights and obligations as well as to relevant services. The Authority will provide information on employment, learning, mobility, recruitment and training opportunities, as well as guidance on the rights and obligations of those who live, work or are engaged in cross-border activities in another EU Member State; 2. support operational cooperation between authorities to ensure cross-border compliance with the relevant Union law, including facilitating the organisation of joint inspections. For example, the Authority will help to improve the exchange of information, support capacity building in national administrations, and assist them in carrying out joint inspections. The objectives are to enhance mutual trust between the actors, to improve day-to-day cooperation and to prevent possible fraud and abuse; 3. propose mediation and facilitate the search for solutions in the event of disputes between national authorities and cross-border disruptions of the labour market such as restructuring of companies affecting several Member States. The new Authority will pool technical and operational tasks of existing EU bodies into a permanent structure with a view to achieving improved and more efficient output In this context, the Authority will take over the management of the EURES European Coordination Office and replace: (i) the Technical Committee on the Free Movement of Workers; (ii) the Committee of Experts on Posting of Workers; (iii) he Technical Commission, the Audit Board, and the Conciliation Board of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems; (iv) replace the European Platform on tackling undeclared work. The Authority will benefit all those subject to Union rules in the field of cross-border mobility of labour and the coordination of social security, specifically, workers, whether employed or not, or any other citizen of the Union or a third-country national legally residing in the Union and in a cross-border situation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total budgetary cost for the EU of the Authority is estimated at EUR 50.9 million per year at cruising speed (which should be reached by 2023). As regards staff numbers, the Authority would need 69 establishment plan posts, 60 seconded national experts and 15 contract agents."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: The Commission has committed funds to Member States' national programmes under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece. Decision (EU) 2015/1601 was amended by Council Decision (EU) 2016/1754 to take account of legal admissions from Turkey. The Council decisions allowed the effective relocation, from Greece and Italy, of 34 705 applicants in need of international protection, as well as the legal admission, from Turkey, of 5 345 persons in need of international protection. These decisions have since ceased to apply. Of the EUR 843 million committed in 2016 to Member States' national programmes under the AMIF, some EUR 567 million are still available. However, payments should be made for these commitments before the end of 2018, after which the amounts will no longer be available to Member States for their national programmes under the AMIF. The Commission considers that Member States should be able to use the amounts available to continue to relocate by recommitting these amounts to the same action in national programmes or to allocate these amounts to other actions in the fields of migration and asylum, once the Council decisions are no longer valid. In addition, the target group of persons eligible for relocation should be broadened so that Member States have greater flexibility in the relocations they carry out. The AMIF is an important tool to complement EU actions in the fields of borders and security, in particular because it provides financial support for the establishment and operation of reception and registration centres (hotspots). Member States' needs in these areas remain considerable. CONTENT: The proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) aims to allow Member States to re-commit or transfer amounts within national programmes, through revisions to these national programmes, so as to promote EU priorities in the areas of migration and asylum, including relocation. In practical terms, the proposal: extends the period for the use of the funds concerned - by two years from the date of the approval by the Commission of the revised national programmes - in order to give Member States sufficient time to implement the actions to which the amounts have been re-committed or transferred; extends the target group of persons eligible for resettlement under the current AMIF, i.e. beneficiaries of international protection, to include applicants for international protection who are being transferred; makes it possible to re-commit amounts committed to supporting the implementation of Council decisions for the purpose of relocations, or to transfer these amounts to other actions defined in the Regulation establishing the AMIF, according to the needs of the Member States. Such re-commitment or transfer operations would be possible only once and would have to be duly justified in the context of a revision of the national programmes, which would have to be approved by the Commission; extends by a maximum of six months the deadline for decommitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601, so that Member States have sufficient time to review national programmes and make changes related to possible re-commitments or transfers of amounts."

Cedefop‚Äôs tasks : since its establishment in 1975, the Centre has adapted its activities to the overall societal, institutional and economic developments and emerging trends in European policies in the field of vocational education and training. This includes technological developments, as vocational occupations have been increasingly relying on the use of digital technologies. To respond to the evolution of the changing policy context, Cedefop's current activities go beyond vocational education and training and include work on qualifications, in particular the European Qualifications Framework, on skills analysis and forecasting, and the validation of non-formal and informal learning which should all be acknowledged. The new objectives and tasks will be adjusted to better reflect these developments. This revision will define more sharply the role of Cedefop in supporting the shaping and implementation of vocational education and training, skills and qualifications policies. Other measures related to the decentralised agencies : the revision also creates the opportunity to provide for: anti-fraud measures, conflict of interest policy, evaluation and review measures, the establishment of a headquarters agreement, the provisions on programming and reporting with the requirements set by the revised Framework Financial Regulation. Organisational aspects : the revision will lead to modifying and aligning the appointment procedure of the Director (Executive Director) with the procedure provided for in the Common Approach.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom submitted the notification of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. This means that, unless a ratified withdrawal agreement establishes another date, all Union primary and secondary law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019, ('the withdrawal date'). The United Kingdom will then become a third country. Subject to any transitional arrangement that may be contained in a possible withdrawal agreement, the EU legislative framework governing type approval for a number of products will no longer apply to the United Kingdom. This also means that the United Kingdom type-approval authority will cease to be an EU type-approval authority. Manufacturers who obtained approvals in the United Kingdom in the past will thus need to obtain new approvals from EU-27 type approval authorities, including for products already in production, in order to ensure continued compliance with EU legislation and retain access to the Union market. While the legal framework for these products sets procedural requirements harmonising the way in which type-approvals are granted across the EU, some safeguards make it difficult for relevant manufacturers to take the necessary measures to ensure regulatory compliance and business continuity after the EU acquis ceases to apply to the United Kingdom. For example: the EU type-approval system allows manufacturers to choose freely the type-approval authority to which they submit their type-approval applications. However, it does not allow for the change of the authority once an approval has been granted, and it is not possible for one authority to amend the approval issued by another authority; the type-approval legislation requires that a type-approval authority may only accept test reports from technical services which the Member State to whom it belongs; it is a fundamental principle of the type approval system that a product may only be approved against the requirements applicable to new types (as opposed to new vehicles) at the time when the approval is granted; once the United Kingdom type-approval authority has ceased to be an EU type-approval authority, it can no longer ensure the conformity of production and in service conformity of products already in circulation; responsible type-approval authority is also needed for the recall of a product that is not in conformity with safety or environmental requirements. These issues create significant legal uncertainty for manufacturers with United Kingdom type-approvals. Manufacturers should be able to continue the production of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units previously based on approvals granted by the United Kingdom and to continue placing these products on the Union market. It is therefore necessary to allow manufacturers to obtain new approvals issued by the authorities of Member States of the Union other than the United Kingdom. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation complements Directive 2007/46/EC, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 by establishing special provisions for the EU type-approval and the placing on the market of vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units which have been type-approved by the approval authority of the United Kingdom before the day Union law ceases to apply to and in the United Kingdom. The present proposal aims to address them by modifying temporarily and in a very targeted manner the existing rules to allow concerned manufacturers to obtain new EU-27 approvals that replace their existing UK type-approved products. Specifically, the proposal: explicitly allows concerned manufacturers to apply to an EU-27 type-approval authority for new approvals for existing types; allows that tests underpinning the UK type approvals do not have to be repeated because the technical service was not designated and notified by the EU-27 type approval authority before; provides that such approvals may be granted if the requirements for new vehicles, systems, components and separate technical units are met rather than those for new types; proposes to help identify new type-approval authorities for those products already on the market prior to the withdrawal, to avoid that no authority would be in charge of carrying out in-service conformity checks or issuing a possible future recall. The provisions proposed in the proposal will not lower the requirements regarding the safety or environmental performance of the vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units. It will not grant any advantages to manufacturers with UK type-approvals, compared to manufacturers with EU-27 type-approvals. On the contrary, the initiative will simply allow manufacturers to continue producing their products in compliance with applicable legal requirements without interrupting their existing production."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC grants equivalence to certain non-EU countries as regards field inspections and production of seed of certain species that are carried out in accordance with Union law. The national provisions governing seed harvested and controlled in these countries afford the same assurances as regards the seed‚Äôs characteristics and the arrangements for examining it, for ensuring seed identification, for marking and for control as the provisions applicable to seed harvested and controlled within the European Union. Since Brazil and Moldova are not among these non-EU countries, seed harvested there cannot be imported into the EU. Brazil submitted a request to the Commission that its fodder plant and cereal seed be covered by Council Decision 2003/17/EC as regards the equivalence of such seed. Moldova has submitted a request for the Commission to grant equivalence to its system of field inspections of cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed, and to cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre seed produced and certified in Moldova. After audits of the field inspections and seed certification systems in Brazil and Moldova, the Commission concluded that the requirements and systems in place in these two countries are equivalent to the EU's and provide the same assurances.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 493(1) and 498(1) of Regulation (EU) n¬∫ 575/2013 (‚ÄòCRR‚Äô) exempt commodity dealers from large exposures requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017. This 'sunset clause' was originally included in the CRR in order to allow time for regulators to determine a prudential regulation adapted to the risk profile of commodity dealers. To this end, the CRR mandates the Commission to prepare reports by the end of 2015. On the basis of those reports, the Commission may decide to submit proposals to amend the CRR. The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) laid down in the CRR and Directive 2013/36/EC (‚Äòthe Capital Requirements Directive‚Äô) is currently under review. The results will determine the appropriate prudential treatment of commodity dealers. The investment firms review is a complex project. The finalisation of the review and the adoption of new legislation that may be required in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017. It is therefore highly improbable that any legislation that may result from this review can be prepared, adopted and applied before the current exemptions expire. This has implications for commodity dealers: if no specific prudential framework that may result from the investment firm review would be in place by then, they would be subject to the full CRR/CRD requirements starting from 1 January 2018. This could force them to significantly increase the amount of own funds that they need to have in order to continue their activities and could therefore increase the related costs of performing those activities. To prevent this situation arising, the Commission feels it opportune to extend the existing exemptions laid down in the CRR, while taking into account the amount of time that will be necessary to conclude the investment firms review and to prepare, adopt and apply any legislation that may result from that review. CONTENT: the proposed provisions aim to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity dealers from the large exposures and own funds requirements and accordingly, amend Regulation 575/2013. These exemptions apply until 31 December 2020 or the date of entry into force of any amendments, whichever is the earlier."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (recast of Directives 2005/71/EC and 2004/114/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union‚Äôs working age population has practically stopped growing and over the next couple of years it will start shrinking. The EU is also facing a situation of 'innovation emergency'. Europe is spending 0.8% of GDP less than the US and 1.5% less than Japan every year on Research & Development (R&D). in addition, thousands of the best researchers and innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more favorable. To counterbalance this lack of manpower, immigration from outside the EU is one source of highly skilled people, and third-country national students and researchers in particular are groups which are increasingly sought after and which the EU needs to actively attract. Allowing third-country nationals to acquire skills and knowledge through a period of training in Europe encourages ‚Äúbrain circulation‚Äù and supports cooperation with third countries. However, in the absence of a clear legal framework, there is also a risk of exploitation to which trainees and au-pairs are particularly exposed, with the subsequent risk of unfair competition on the labour market. With a view to better optimising those benefits and properly tackling those risks, and taking account of the similarities of the challenges faced by these categories of migrants, this proposal amends Council Directive 2004/114/EC (‚ÄúStudents‚Äô Directive‚Äù) on the conditions of admission of third country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service: extending its scope to remunerated trainees and au-pairs and making mandatory provisions on unremunerated trainees that are currently discretionary, as well as Council Directive 2005/71/EC on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research (‚ÄúResearchers‚Äô Directive‚Äù). The proposal seeks to remedy the shortcomings highlighted in the implementation reports of the two Directives [see COM(2011)901 and 587] on the conditions of admissions in particular (visas, mobility aspects‚Ä¶) and procedural safeguards. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the following options were considered: Option 1 (baseline): the Member States would continue to apply different and diverging rules with respect to admission conditions (e.g. the granting of visas); Option 2: Increased communication efforts (in particular in case of researchers), and strengthened enforcement of the current rules; Option 3: Improvement of admission conditions, rights and procedural guarantees whereby Member States would be obliged to (i) grant the requisite visas to the third-country national (students and other categories) who has submitted an application and (ii) introduce a compulsory deadline for decisions on an application (60 days); (iii) provide for the right of students to work during their period of study for a minimum of 15 hours per week; Option 4: Further improvement of admission conditions, rights also on intra-EU mobility and procedural guarantees: (i) access to job-seeking following completion of studies or research project; (ii) extended scope to au-pairs and remunerated trainees; (iii) possibility to issue long-stay visas or residence permits; (iv) increased intra-EU mobility for researchers, students and remunerated trainees; (v) specific, more favorable rules applicable to beneficiaries of EU programmes (e.g. Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie); (vi) right of students to work for a minimum of 20 hours per week as of the first year of residence ; (vii) after finalization of their studies/research, students and researchers would be allowed to stay on the territory to identify work opportunities for a period of 12 months; (viii) decisions on applications within 60 days (all groups), and within 30 days for Erasmus Mundus and Marie Curie fellows. Option 4 appears to be the most cost-effective option to meet the key objectives and brings about positive economic and social impacts. The main disadvantage of legislative changes would be the costs involved: Member States would have to make modifications to their legislative frameworks. LEGAL BASIS: Article 79(2) points (a) and (b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal‚Äôs overall objective is to support social, cultural and economic relationships between the EU and third countries, foster the transfer of skills and know-how and promote competitiveness while, at the same time, provide for safeguards ensuring fair treatment of these groups of third-country nationals. Chapter I ‚Äì General provisions: the proposal has two specific objectives: to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals to the territory of the Member States for a period exceeding three months for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing; to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country national students and remunerated trainees in Member States other than the Member State which first grants the third-country national an authorisation. Scope: the proposal extends the scope of the ‚ÄúStudent‚Äù Directive to include remunerated trainees and au-pairs. The proposal would not, however, apply to third-country nationals who are EU long-term residents given their more privileged status and their specific type of residence permit, or refugees, those residing in a Member State on a strictly temporary basis in accordance with Union legislation. Member States may grant more favourable conditions for the persons to whom the proposal for Directive applies, however only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern family members of researchers, rights to equal treatment, economic activities and procedural safeguards. Chapter II ‚Äì Admission: General principle: an applicant who satisfies all the general and specific conditions for admission shall be granted a residence permit or a long-stay visa by the Member State where the application has been made. The proposal lays down the general conditions that applicants must fulfil in order to be admitted to a Member State, besides the specific conditions that apply to the different categories of third-country nationals laid down in the proposal. The general conditions are very much in line with those developed in the existing acquis on legal migration, and include valid documents, sickness insurance and minimum resources. Specific conditions: - the specific conditions of admission for researchers which already exist in the Researchers' Directive are maintained. The proposal lists the elements that should be contained in the hosting agreement: title and purpose of the research project, the confirmation of the organisation that it is hosting the researcher so that he or she can complete the research project, the start and end date of the research project, etc. For researchers to be aware of research organisations that can enter into hosting agreements, emphasis is placed in the proposal on the need for the list of approved organisation to be publicly available and up-dated regularly; - for students, the specific conditions are those in the ‚ÄúStudents‚Äô Directive‚Äù; - for pupils, remunerated and unremunerated trainees, volunteers and au-pairs, the specific conditions are that these persons are required to show evidence of the organisation that is responsible for their exchange, training or, volunteering. for au-pairs: in addition, there needs to be evidence that the host family accepts responsibility for example as far as subsistence and accommodation are concerned. The au-pair stay also needs to be based on an agreement between the au-pair and the host family defining his/her rights and obligations; for remunerated trainees, the training programme, its duration, conditions of supervision and working conditions need to be specified. In order to avoid situations in which trainees are used as 'cheap labour', the host entity may be obliged to declare that the third-country national is not filling a job. Chapter III ‚Äì Authorisations and duration of residence: a series of provisions set out the information that should be included on the third-country national's residence permit or long-term visa. For researchers and students an authorisation should be granted for at least one year. For all other groups, the authorisation is limited to one year as a rule, with the possibility for exceptions. Chapter IV ‚Äì Grounds for refusal, withdrawal or non-renewal of authorisations: the provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusing, withdrawing or not renewing an authorisation, such as the general and specific conditions for admission no longer being met, false documents etc., which are standard conditions under the existing migration Directives. Chapter V ‚Äì Rights: to ensure the fair treatment of third-country nationals falling under the scope of the Directive, a new provision entitles them to equal treatment under the Single Permit Directive. More favourable rights to equal treatment with nationals of the host Member State as regards branches of social security as defined in Regulation No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security schemes are maintained for third-country national researchers, without the possibility for the limitations laid down by the Single Permit Directive. Furthermore, school pupils, volunteers, unremunerated trainees and au-pairs will benefit from equal treatment rights with nationals of the host Member State as regards access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services made available to the public independently on whether Union or national law gives them access to the labour market. Right to work: provisions exist in the proposal whereby researchers and students are given the right to work , with Member States being able to set certain limits. Researchers, as was the case under Directive 2005/71, are allowed to teach in accordance with national legislation. Regarding students, whereas under Directive 2004/114/EC students were allowed to work for a minimum of 10 hours per week, this period has been increased to 20 hours. With respect to students' access to economic activities, Member States may continue take into consideration their labour market situation but this should be done in a proportionate way in order not to systematically endanger the right to work. The proposal introduces the possibility for students and researchers, if they fulfil the general admission conditions of the proposal (except for the condition on being a minor), to stay in the Member State for 12 months upon finalisation of their studies/research in order to look for work or set up a business. This provision has the potential to make the Member States more competitive in the search for talents on a global stage. It would however not be an automatic work permit. In a period of more than 3 and less than 6 months, Member States could ask the third-country nationals to provide documentation that they are genuinely seeking for a job (for example, copies of the letters and CVs sent to employers) or are in the process of setting up a business. After 6 months, they could also ask third- country nationals to provide evidence that they have a genuine chance of being engaged or of launching a business. The proposal includes specific provisions on the admission and access to the labour market of researchers' family members in derogation to Directive 2003/86/EC with a view to increasing the EU‚Äôs attractiveness to third-country national researchers. Chapter VI ‚Äì Mobility between Member States: a series of articles set out the conditions under which researchers, students and trainees can move between the Member States, in order to facilitate such mobility: for researchers , under Directive 2005/71/EC, the period for which they are allowed to move to a second Member State on the basis of the hosting agreement concluded in the first Member State has been extended from 3 to 6 months (N.B. in line with the provisions of the Blue Card Directive, researchers' family members can move between Member States together with the researcher). for students , provisions would also allow them to move to a second Member State for a period of up to 6 months on the basis of the authorisation granted by the first Member State . Specific rules apply to third country nationals who come under EU mobility programmes, for example the current Erasmus Mundus or Marie Curie programmes, in order to simplify the exercise of mobility. Chapter VII ‚Äì Procedure and transparency: the proposal introduces a time-limit that obliges Member States to decide on the complete application for an authorisation and notify the applicant in writing within 60 days (applying for all groups), and within 30 days for Union programmes including mobility measures. Procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decisions in writing, and ensuring respect for the right to a legal remedy. Provisions are also included in regard to communication: the Member States would be required to make information available on the entry and residence conditions as set by this proposal, including on approved research organisations and on fees. Taxes and fees: Member States may charge fees for the processing of applications. However, the amount of such fees should not endanger the fulfilment of the Directive's objectives. Chapter VIII - Final provisions: Member States would be required to establish national contact points to exchange information on third-country nationals covered by the proposal who move between Member States. Such national contact points already exist in relation to certain existing migration Directives such as the Blue Card Directive. Member States would be required to communicate to the Commission statistics on the numbers of third-country nationals granted authorisations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the EU‚Äôs budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 140/2008 of 19 November 2007 on certain procedures for applying the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part, and for applying the Interim Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and Montenegro, of the other part. The new proposed Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main provisions codified : the proposal lays down certain procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part (‚ÄòSAA‚Äô). It stipulates that fishery products originating in Montenegro may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of those tariff quotas. Tariff quotas : the proposal sets out in particular: concessions for fish and fishery products certain tariff reductions. The proposal also lays down conditions as regards the safeguard clauses for agricultural and fishery products provided for in the Agreement as well as a general safeguard clause. The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require. The proposal sets out conditions as regards the administrative cooperation to facilitate the management of the Agreement. It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 140/2008."

The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Opening of tariff quotas : the Union negotiated tariff concessions under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and under the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. Management : the Commission: should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries; should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and their period of validity."

Main provisions codified : under the Agreement establishing an Association between the European Economic Community and Turkey, concessions were granted to that country in respect of certain agricultural products. 1996 been applying a ban on the import of live animals of the bovine species and restrictions on the import of beef. Those measures, being quantitative restrictions, are incompatible with the Agreement and prevent the Union from benefiting from the concessions granted to it under Decision No 1/98 of the EC-Turkey Association Council. As a result of those measures, exports to Turkey of the products in question originating in the Union are blocked. Suspension of concessions : in order to protect the Union's commercial interests, the situation should be counterbalanced by means of equivalent measures. The concessions set out in the Annex to this Regulation should therefore be suspended. In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (examination procedure). It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 1506/98."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), under the provisions of Article XIV of the FAO constitution, was approved by the FAO Conference in 1949 and entered into force in 1952. Amendments to this Agreement were approved in 1963, 1976 and 1997. The European Community acceded to the GFCM on 16 June 1998 through Decision 98/416/EC. Mediterranean and Black Sea EU Member States are also parties to this Agreement. The GFCM is a so-called Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO), with the aim of promoting the development, conservation, rational management and best utilization of living marine resources, as well as the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. An amendment of the GFCM Agreement was launched in 2013 following a performance review finalised in 2011, which concluded that the Agreement should be amended to clarify the objectives and functions of the GFCM, and strengthen its efficiency. The amended Agreement was negotiated with the GFCM Contracting Parties. The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Union on matters falling within the Union's competence. The negotiations were carried out by Member States and the Commission as per their respective areas of competence in accordance to the terms of the mandate. The Contracting Parties to the GFCM endorsed the ""Amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean"" at the GFCM 38 Annual Session on 19-24 May 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the amended Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission invites the Council to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. The amended Agreement revises the structure and content of the current one, so as to bring it in line with modern RFMO instruments. Amendment: main changes introduced are as follows: - A clearer explanation of the purpose of the GFCM Agreement: the new Agreement sets a clear overall objective of biological, social, economic and environmental sustainability of living marine resources. It also introduces definitions of the terms that are necessary for the correct interpretation of the Agreement. Better defined functions of the GFCM, which include the promotion of common fishery management through multiannual management plans, the establishment of fisheries restricted areas, and the collection and dissemination of data. In this context, the new Agreement integrates core elements of the Common Fisheries Policy regarding: - Sanctions: the amendment includes provisions for the establishment of measures/sanctions to address non-compliance by Members/non-Members. - Dispute settlements: the establishment of a well-defined dispute settlement mechanism in case disputes arise between Contracting Parties. It should be noted that the text of the amended Agreement will undergo a final legal check by the FAO, which should be finalised in October 2014. The text may therefore undergo changes, which are not expected to be of substance."

This Regulation applies to imports of products originating in third countries, except for: (a) textile products subject to specific import rules under Regulation (EC) No 517/94; (b) the products originating in certain third countries listed in Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009. The main elements of the proposed Regulation concern: Union information and consultation procedure : the Commission should be informed by the Member States of any danger created by trends in imports which might call for Union surveillance or the application of safeguard measures. In such instances the Commission should examine the terms and conditions under which imports occur, the trend in imports, the various aspects of the economic and trade situations and, where appropriate, the measures to be applied. Union investigation procedure : an investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure, subject to the reservation that the Commission be allowed in urgent cases to apply provisional measures. The proposal lays down detailed provisions on the opening of investigations, the checks and inspections required, access by exporter countries and interested parties to the information gathered, hearings for the parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views. It also establishes time limits for the initiation of investigations and for determinations as to whether or not measures are appropriate, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. Surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in a third country covered by this Regulation threatens to cause injury to Union producers, and where the interests of the Union so require, import of that product may be subject, as appropriate, to retrospective Union surveillance. The decision to impose surveillance shall be taken by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Safeguard measures : it falls on the Commission to adopt the safeguard measures required by the interests of the Union. Those interests should be considered as a whole and should in particular encompass the interests of Union producers, users and consumers. Safeguard measures against a member of the WTO may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such greatly increased quantities and on such terms or conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products. These measures shall take effect immediately. The proposal determines the maximum duration of safeguard measures and specific provisions regarding extension, progressive liberalisation and reviews of such measures. The implementation of this Regulation requires uniform conditions for adopting provisional and definitive safeguard measures, and for the imposition of prior surveillance measures. Those measures should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: improving road safety is a prime objective of the Union's transport policy. An important element of that policy is the consistent enforcement of sanctions for road traffic offences committed in the Union which considerably jeopardise road safety. However, due to a lack of appropriate procedures and notwithstanding existing possibilities under Council Decision 2008/615/JHA and Council Decision 2008/616/JHA (the 'Pr√ºm Decisions'), sanctions in the form of financial penalties for certain road traffic offences are often not enforced if those offences are committed with a vehicle, which is registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place. On 19 March 2008, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety on the basis of Article 71(1)(c) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Article 91 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFUE')). Directive 2011/82/EU was adopted on 25 October 2011. The European Parliament and the Council chose Article 87(2) TFEU on police cooperation as its legal basis. The Commission fully supported the contents of the adopted Directive but decided to challenge its legal basis before the Court of Justice of the European Union. In its judgement of 6 May 2014, case C-43/12, the Court annulled Directive 2011/82/EU, but maintained its effects until the entry into force of a new Directive on the basis of the transport article of the Treaty within a reasonable period of time. Following the Commission Communication of 20 July 2010 entitled 'Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020', the Council invited the Commission to examine the possibilities of harmonising traffic rules at Union level where appropriate and adopting further measures on facilitating cross-border enforcement with regard to road traffic offences, in particular those related to serious traffic accidents. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that the proposal does not contain any new elements as compared to the annulled Directive, the impact assessment of the initial Commission proposal remains valid. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to ensure a high level of protection for all road users in the Union by facilitating the cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences and thereby the enforcement of sanctions, where those offences are committed with a vehicle registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place. Road safety related traffic offences comprise: speeding; failing to stop at a red traffic light; driving under the influence of drink, drugs; failing to wear a safety helmet; illegally using a mobile telephone or any other communication devices while driving. The proposal is almost identical to the text of the annulled Directive. The main objective of that Directive was to put an end to the anonymity of non-resident drivers and to make sure that their road traffic offences would not go unpunished. For this reason the Directive provided the Member States with the mutual access to each other's vehicle registration data via an electronic data exchange network. This would allow them to identify drivers when they commit traffic offences abroad, thus ensuring equal treatment of non-resident and resident drivers. Once the vehicle owner's name and address are known, a letter to the presumed offender may be sent, on the basis of a model established by the Directive. The Member State of offence will have kept their right to decide on the follow up of the traffic offence. The Commission proposes to introduce minor amendments in order to comply with the Court of Justice case: Legal basis : the legal basis for the adoption of measures at EU level in the field of road safety is Article 91(1)(c) TFEU. UK, Ireland and Denmark : in recitals 22 and 23 of the annulled Directive, UK, Ireland and Denmark had, in accordance with Protocols no 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaties, the possibility not to take part in adoption of, be bound by or subject to the application of that Directive. However, where those Protocols do not apply since they only apply to Title V of the TFEU, those recitals should be deleted. Data protection : taking account of the new legal basis, the general rules on data protection provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data should therefore apply. Consequently, the proposal should refer to Directive 95/46/EC, both in general and for the provisions on rectification, erasure, blocking and maximum storage time.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council agreed, in its conclusions of 9 March 2012, to propose a joint quantified emission reduction commitment of 20% for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the Union. In December 2012, at the Doha Climate Change Conference, the 192 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted an amendment to the Protocol. This ‚ÄòDoha Amendment‚Äô establishes a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020, with legally binding emission reduction commitments for the Parties listed in its Annex B. The agreement on the Doha Amendment came as part of a broader package. Under the Doha Amendment, the European Union, its Member States and Iceland commit to limit their average annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80 % of their base year emissions (mostly 1990). The Doha Amendment also makes further amendments to the text of the Protocol to be implemented in the second commitment period. these amendments concern: (i) the inclusion of a new gas - nitrogen trifluoride (NF3); (ii) an ‚Äòambition mechanism‚Äô which provides for a simplified procedure which allows a Party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period; (iii) a provision which automatically adjusts a Party‚Äôs target to prevent an increase in its emissions for the period 2013 to 2020 beyond its average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision provides the basis for the conclusion of the Doha Amendment by the European Union and sets out the terms of the joint fulfilment of the commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland. It is accompanied by a proposal for a regulation on technical issues related to implementation by the EU and Member States of the second commitment period. The ratification Decision enables the EU, as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, to ratify the Doha amendment. It also sets out the terms according to which the EU, its Member States and Iceland will fulfil the 20% emissions reduction commitment jointly. The formal entry into force of the Doha Amendment is an important objective for the European Union. The Commission would like Member States to take the necessary steps to complete their domestic ratification processes not later than 16 February 2015. Once they have finalised their own ratification processes, Member States together with the EU, will simultaneously deposit their instruments of acceptance to enable simultaneous entry into force for all of them. This should take place well before the Paris Climate Change Conference at the end of 2015. On the international level, the Doha amendment will enter into force when it has been ratified by three quarters of Parties to the Protocol (144 of the 192 Parties). The European Union is a Party to the Protocol in its own right, as are all Member States and Iceland. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the budget of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force on 16 February 2005 and contains legally binding emission reduction commitments for its first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, for Parties listed in its Annex B. The Union and the Member States ratified the Protocol on 31 May 2002, and agreed to fulfil its commitments under the first commitment period jointly. Iceland ratified the Protocol on 23 May 2002. At the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, all Parties to the Protocol agreed on the Doha Amendment which establishes a second commitment period of the Protocol (starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020). The Doha Amendment amends Annex B of the Protocol, setting out further legally-binding mitigation commitments for Parties listed in that Annex for the second commitment period, and amending and further elaborates provisions on the implementation of Parties‚Äô commitments during the second commitment period. The Union, the Member States and Iceland also issued a joint declaration upon the adoption of the Doha Amendment, expressing their intention to fulfil their commitments in the second commitment period jointly. The declaration was agreed in December 2012. The agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol should now be formally concluded on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Council is called upon to conclude the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is hereby concluded on behalf of the Union. Purpose of the agreement: the agreement with Iceland sets out the terms governing Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, its Member States and Iceland. It does not establish any obligations for the Union or its Member States. Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment: Iceland's participates in the joint fulfilment on the same basis as that of the Member States. Iceland's emission level, identical to its assigned amount, will relate to Iceland's emissions from gases and sectors covered under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period but that are not covered under the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system (Directive 2003/87/EC7). Application of relevant EU legislation to Iceland: as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the Union and the Member States are subject to a number of monitoring, reporting and verification requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. For Parties that have agreed to fulfil their commitments jointly, some of this information needs to be submitted jointly. As a consequence, the Commission will require information from Iceland to enable the Union to fulfil its reporting commitments. Moreover, Iceland will need to participate in the registry system of the Union and its Member States that are relevant for the fulfilment of obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. This requires Iceland to apply Union legislation that is not applicable to third countries (including the Parties to the European Economic Area), especially in relation to the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions as well as with regard to the operation of a registry and the accounting for transactions related to the implementation of commitments of the Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in line with the terms of joint fulfilment and the internationally agreed rules. The agreement contains a list of Union legislation that shall be binding upon Iceland. It also provides for a procedure to amend this list, to ensure that Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment and follows the same rules and responsibilities as that of Member States, in line with internationally agreed requirements. The agreement also provides for the establishment of a Joint Fulfilment Committee, which ensures the effective implementation and operation of the agreement. Duration and termination of the agreement with Iceland: the draft agreement with Iceland is concluded for a limited time period, until all matters related to the implementation of the second commitment period will have been completed. In case of a breach by Iceland, or objection by Iceland to amend the list of legal acts with application in Iceland according to this agreement, Iceland will be individually responsible to account for all of its greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol, including those under the scope of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system. Ratification: pursuing the rapid entry into force of the Doha Amendment, before the United Nations climate conference in Paris at the end of 2015, which is to adopt a new legally binding instrument for the period after 2020, the Member States and Iceland will seek to ratify both the Doha Amendment and the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol not later than February 2015."

It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts when, for reasons of economic and technical changes, data requirements need to be updated, including submission deadlines and revisions, extensions and eliminations of data flows set out in Annex I, and when the definitions set out in Annex II need to be updated; confer implementing powers upon the Commission, in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, with a view to adopting common quality standards and harmonising the content and periodicity of the quality reports. The European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) shall assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers in certain statistical domains. These exclude the balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment. In these domains, according to Regulation (EC) No 184/2005, the Balance of Payments Committee (BOP Committee) assists the Commission. The Commission is proposing a new ESS structure to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, which is regarded as the umbrella committee within the ESS. Therefore, it is also proposed to amend Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 by replacing the references to the BOP committee by a reference to the ESSC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council constituted the Union regulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution of veterinary medicinal products. In the light of the experience acquired and following the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal market for veterinary medicinal products, the Commission has presented a proposal that will repeal and replace Directive 2001/82/EC on veterinary medicinal products. This proposal lays down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to take account of the fact that centralised marketing authorisation for veterinary products is being decoupled from that for medicines for humans. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission‚Äôs Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 so as to: delete from Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the provisions regarding granting and maintaining marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products . The rules on marketing authorisations valid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation on veterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinal products will cover all routes granting marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products in the Union ‚Äì both at centralised and national level; establish certain principles applicable to fees payable to the Agency , including the need to take into account, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon; align the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to Articles 290 and 291 (delegated and implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. As set out in the legislative financial statement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the regulatory and legislative framework for retail payments in the EU has been developed over the past 12 years, with the advent of the Euro acting as an accelerating factor. One of the key practices hindering the achievement of an integrated market reasons is the widespread use of so-called Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs). At present, no legislation regulating interchange fees is in place in the EU. MIFs are collectively agreed inter-bank fees usually between the acquiring payment service providers and the issuing payment service providers belonging to a certain scheme. Such interchange fees paid by acquiring payment service providers form part of the fees they charge to merchants which merchants in turn pass on to consumers. Thus, high Interchange Fees paid by merchants result in higher final prices for goods and services, which are paid by all consumers. There currently is a wide variety of interchange fees applied within national and international payment card schemes, which gives rise to market fragmentation and prevents retailers and consumers from enjoying the benefits of an internal market for goods and services. Market entry for pan-European players remains difficult, as domestic interchange fees in EU Member States vary widely and new entrants would have to offer interchange fees at least comparable to those prevailing in each market they want to enter. The entry barriers interchange fees thus created for online and mobile payment solutions also result in less innovation. Over the last 20 years, the European Commission and national competition authorities have conducted a number of antitrust proceedings addressing anti-competitive practices in the card payment market. The General Court judgment of May 2012 confirmed the Commission's finding in its MasterCard Decision of December 2007 that MIFs restrict competition as they inflate the cost of card acceptance by merchants without leading to benefits for consumers. In its non-legislative resolution of 20 November 2012 on the Green Paper 'Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments‚Äù, the Parliament took a firm position in favour of providing clarity on interchange fees to market participants and expressed itself in favour of a gradual approach leading to a ban on interchange fees through regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considers six scenarios for interchange fees. The assessment concludes that the most beneficial option appears to be a combination of: capping the level of interchange fees for cross-border transactions with consumer debit and credit cards (in the first stage) and, in a second stage, capping the level of interchange fees also for domestic transactions with consumer credit cards and consumer debit cards; a series of measures to enhance effective market functioning including the limitation of the rule allowing merchants to determine the choice of card brand at the point of sale for all cards and card-based transactions based on four party scheme models. CONTENT: the present regulation, combined with the proposed revised Payment Services Directive, proposes to create common rules for interchange fees in the European Union by introducing maximum fee levels for transactions with payment cards that are widely used by consumers and thereby difficult to refuse or surcharge by retailers. The regulation will in addition propose transparency measures to allow retailers and consumers to make better informed choices of payment instruments. Capping interchange fees : the Commission proposes to set caps for interchange fees to payment service providers of 0.2% and 0.3% for the value of the transaction for all consumer debit and credit transactions. These figures have been accepted by Visa, MasterCard and the French domestic card scheme Groupement Cartes Bancaires. During a transition period of two years, maximum levels of interchange fees are imposed for cross-border transactions (where the card holder uses their card in another Member State) or cross-border acquired transactions (where the merchant uses an acquiring PSP in another Member State) only. After a transitional period, the regulation of interchange fees for consumer cards should therefore be extended to cover also domestic interchange fees. Business rules : the proposed Regulation contains measures as regards business rules that will be applicable to all categories of card transactions and card-based payment transactions based on those. As of the entry into force of the regulation, for instance: the application of the 'Honour All Cards Rule' will be limited. No discrimination will be nonetheless allowed on the basis of the issuing bank or the provenance of the card holder and between the cards carrying the same interchange fee level; the application of any rule preventing or limiting merchants from steering customers to more efficient payments instruments ('no steering rules') will be prohibited; acquiring Payment Service Providers will provide at least monthly statements of fees to merchants, in which the fees paid by the merchant over the relevant month concerning each category of cards and each individual brand for when the acquirer provides acquiring services is specified; the application of any rule withholding merchants from disclosing to their customers fees they pay to payment services acquirers will be prohibited. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of providing EU citizens with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãfreedom, security and justice without internal borders presupposes exchanging information extracted from criminal records between the competent authorities of the Member States. These exchanges of information are organised and facilitated by the rules laid down in Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between Member States, a new criminal procedure and the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) established by Council Decision 2009/316/JHA. Although it is possible to exchange information on convictions concerning third-country nationals (TCNs) through ECRIS, there is no procedure or mechanism to do so in an efficient manner. Information on third country nationals is not gathered within the Union in the Member State of nationality as it is for nationals of Member States, but only stored in the Member States where the convictions have been handed down. A complete overview of the criminal history of a third country national can therefore be ascertained only if such information is requested from all Member States. Such 'blanket requests' impose an administrative burden on all Member States, including those not holding information on that third country national. In practice, this burden deters Member States from requesting information on third country nationals, and leads to Member States limiting the criminal record information to information stored in their national register. To improve the situation, it is proposed to establish a system by which the central authority of a Member State can find out quickly and efficiently in which other Member State(s) criminal record information on a third country national is stored. As a result of the terrorist attacks in many European cities, exchange of information on criminal records is crucial to combat cross-border crime. The initiative follows the requests of the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council to improve the existing ECRIS. It also reflects the Commission's new approach to the management of data for borders and security. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the creation of a centralised ECRIS-TCN system containing both alphanumeric data and fingerprints is the preferred solution. It would be the most cost efficient, and technically less complex and easier to maintain compared to the others. This option also offers the additional advantages of making the ECRIS-TCN system suitable for participating in a future shared biometric matching service and a common identity repository, facilitating direct access for Eurojust, Europol, [and the European Public Prosecutor's Office] and creating a central contact point at Eurojust for third States requiring information on convicted TCN. If Member States were to systematically send ‚Äòblanket‚Äô requests, the administrative burden in responding to them has been identified as the most costly element (estimated up to EUR 78 million) of the ECRIS-workflow; the proposed solution saves such costs. CONTENT: this proposal supplements the Commission's 2016 proposal for a Directive to amend the ECRIS Framework Decision and to repeal the ECRIS Council Decision: creating a centralised system to efficiently identify which Member State(s) hold conviction information on TCN; establishing rules under which the ECRIS-TCN system is used by competent authorities to obtain information on such previous convictions through the European Criminal Records Information System. The proposed hit/no hit search system, based on alphanumeric data and fingerprints of TCN convicted in the Member States, will allow Member States to quickly identify other Member State(s) having convicted a particular TCN. The requesting Member State should then request those identified Member States to provide the actual conviction information through the existing ECRIS system as improved by January 2016 proposal. As soon as this becomes technically possible, facial images may also be used to identify a third country national on the basis of this biometric identifier The proposal sets an obligation for the convicting Member State: to create a data record in the Central ECRIS-TCN System for each convicted TCN as soon as possible after the conviction was entered into the national criminal records register; to create records in the ECRIS-TCN system of 'historical' convictions of third country nationals, i.e. convictions handed down prior to the entry into force of the Regulation. Member States would be required to use the ECRIS-TCN system in all cases where they receive a request for information on previous convictions of third country nationals in accordance with national law, and to follow up on any hits with the Member States identified through the ECRIS system. They would also be required to verify the accuracy of the data sent to the Central System and to correct them, as well as to amend the data sent to the Central System in case of any subsequent amendment in national criminal records. The proposal entrusts eu-LISA with the task of developing and operationally managing the ECRIS-TCN system. It nominates Eurojust as the contact point for third countries and international organisations which wish to request conviction information on a TCN. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on the EU and national budgets would be as follows: (i) one-off costs for the EU of around EUR 13 002 000; (ii) for the Member States approximately EUR 13 344 000 (a total of approximately EUR 26 346 000). Total on-going costs are expected to increase gradually over the years, starting at EUR 8 220 000 and increasing up to a maximum of EUR 17 520 000."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal forms part of the External Investment Plan (EIP) announced in the 7 June 2016 Commission Communication on establishing a new Partnership Framework with third countries under the European Agenda for Migration. It is also in with the EU Global Strategy for Foreign and Security Policy with embeds challenges such as migration in the overall EU foreign policy. The EIP will be based on three pillars working hand in hand: a new investment fund (pillar 1); technical assistance (pillar 2), to help local authorities and companies to develop a higher number of sustainable projects and attract investors; and finally a range of dedicated thematic, national and regional EU development cooperation programmes combined with structured political dialogue targeted at improving the investment climate and overall policy environment in the countries concerned (pillar 3). Pillar 1 will be implemented through the EFSD. The EFSD will have the key objective of providing an integrated financial package to finance investments starting in the regions of Africa and the Neighbourhood. The Commission called for a long term strategy by which the EU will promote the sustainable development goals of the 2030 Agenda and thus continue to address root causes of migration. It shall also contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP 21). According to the Commission, the EFSD is expected to mobilise up to EUR 44 billion investments with funds from the general budget of the Union and other sources of EUR 3 350 million until 2020. CONTENT: this draft Regulation seeks to establish the European Fund for Sustainable Development (EFSD), the EFSD Guarantee and the EFSD Guarantee Fund. Purpose : the purpose of the EFSD as an integrated financial package shall be to support through the supply of financing capacity in the form of grants, guarantees and other financial instruments to eligible counterparts investments and increased access to financing starting in African and Neighbourhood partner countries. The EFSD shall contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda with a particular focus on sustainable growth, job creation, socio-economic sectors and on the support to micro, small and medium sized enterprises. It should tackle root causes of migration and offering sustainable reintegration to returned migrants in their countries of origin while maximising additionality, delivering innovative products and crowding in private sector funds. Regional investment platforms : the EFSD shall be composed of regional investment platforms, which will combine financing from existing blending facilities and the EFSD Guarantee. The management of the EFSD shall be ensured by the Commission. Regional investment platforms will be focused to pursue the achievement of the sustainable development goals and better address root causes of migration. Strategic board of the EFSD : the Commission shall be assisted by a strategic board. It shall provide strategic guidance and support the Commission in setting overall investment goals as regards the use of the EFSD Guarantee. The strategic board shall also support overall coordination and coherence between the regional investment platforms and with the external lending mandate operations managed by the EIB, including the EIB resilience initiative. The strategic board shall be composed of representatives of the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (High Representative), of the Member States and of the EIB. The Commission may invite other contributors to become members of the strategic board having regard where appropriate to the view of the board. Partner Countries and relevant regional organisations, the eligible counterparts and the European Parliament may be given observer status, where appropriate. Project assessment : a sound technical assessment and due diligence as well as a swift implementation of individual projects will be ensured. The bankability and risk of the projects will be assessed by the eligible counterparts and verified by independent experts to ensure the credibility vis-√†-vis the private sector, before the investment proposals are approved by the Commission. The EFSD Guarantee : the Union should make available a guarantee of EUR 1.5 billion to establish the EFSD Guarantee. This fund aims to constitute guarantee capacity for credit enhancement that will ultimately benefit the final investments and allow risk sharing with other investors, notably private actors. It will leverage additional financing, in particular from the private sector, by addressing the key factors that enable crowding-in private investment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union will make available a total of EUR 750 million for the EFSD Guarantee until 2020 stemming both from the Union's general budget and the 11th European Development Fund (EDF). Further financing could be foreseen. The Commission intends to propose the mobilisation of the contingency margin to provide EUR 250 000 000. Other contributions from the Union budget would be made by the use of redeployments or refocusing of programmed funds. Further financing could also include other contributions by other contributors, such as Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled face many barriers to accessing books and other print material protected by copyright and related rights. The availability of books in formats that are accessible to print-disabled persons is estimated to be between 7 % and 20% despite the fact that digital technology greatly facilitates accessible publishing. Accordingly, measures should be taken to increase the availability of these works in accessible formats and improve their circulation in the internal market. The Marrakesh Treaty was adopted in 2013 at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) with the aim of facilitating the availability and cross-border exchange of books and other print material in accessible formats around the world. It was signed by the Union in April 2014. The Treaty requires the parties to provide exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights and allows for the cross-border exchange of special format copies of books, including audio books, and other print material between countries that are parties to the Treaty. This Directive implements the obligations that the Union has to meet under the Marrakesh Treaty in a harmonised manner, with a view to ensuring that those measures are applied consistently throughout the internal market. The proposed Directive is also in line with the Union's obligations deriving from the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ( ªthe UNCRPD º). CONTENT : the main provisions in the draft directive are as follows : Objective : the objective of the measures introduced by the directive is to improve the availability of books, journals, newspapers, magazines and other writings, sheet music and other print material, including in audio form, whether digital or analogue, in formats that make those works and other subject-matter accessible to those persons to substantially the same degree as to persons without an impairment or disability. Accessible formats include Braille, large print, adapted e-books, audio books and radio broadcasts. The proposed directive will facilitate the use of certain copyright protected content, without the authorisation of the rightholder, for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. The terms  ªwork and other subject-matter º, beneficiary person, accessible format copy and authorised entity º are defined in the draft directive. Authorised use : the proposed directive provides for a mandatory exception and states the specific permitted uses by beneficiary persons and authorised entities. These include in particular the rights of reproduction, communication to the public, making available, distribution and lending, as provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, Directive 2006/115/EC, and Directive 2009/24/EC, as well as the corresponding rights in Directive 96/9/EC. Circulation of accessible format copies in the internal market : the proposal aims to ensure that accessible format copies made under the mandatory exception may circulate or be accessed in any Member State. Data protection : the proposal sets out the applicable rules for the protection of personal data. Any processing of personal data must be in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC. Report : the Commission will present a report on the availability in the internal market of works and other subject matter in accessible formats and for persons with disabilities other than those covered by the directive. The proposal sets out the arrangements on the evaluation of the proposed directive, in accordance with better regulation rules. Transposition : Member States should bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive within 12 month after entry into force at the latest."

The Marrakesh Treaty was adopted in 2013 at the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) with the aim of facilitating the availability and cross-border exchange of books and other print material in accessible formats around the world. It was signed by the Union in April 2014. The Treaty requires the parties to provide exceptions or limitations to copyright and related rights and allows for the cross-border exchange of special format copies of books, including audio books, and other print material between countries that are parties to the Treaty. In order to implement the Marrakesh Treaty within the Union, a parallel proposal requires Member States to introduce a mandatory exception to certain rights of right holders harmonised by Union law for the benefit of beneficiary persons and to ensure cross-border access to special format copies within the internal market. Together with the draft directive mentioned above, the proposed regulation will allow the Union to fulfil an international obligation under the Marrakesh Treaty to facilitate access to published works for Persons who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print disabled. CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to implement the obligations in the Marrakesh Treaty with respect to the export and import of accessible format copies for the benefit of beneficiary persons between the Union and third countries that are parties to the Marrakesh Treaty, and to lay down the conditions for such export and import. The proposed regulation: contains provisions on the export of accessible format copies from the Union to third countries; contains provisions on the import of accessible format copies from third countries to the Union; serves to specify the obligations that authorised entities are required to fulfil when exchanging accessible format copies with third countries; sets out the applicable rules for the protection of personal data; sets out the arrangements on the evaluation of the regulation, in accordance with better regulation rules. The proposed regulation supports the right of persons with disabilities to benefit from measures designed to ensure their independence, social and occupational integration and participation in the life of the community, as enshrined in Article 26 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It also reflects the Union's commitments under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: abolishing retail roaming surcharges is an essential step towards ensuring that telecom rules support the establishment and functioning of a digital single market across the Union. This target was also stressed in the Digital Single Market Strategy set out by the Commission. In 2015, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2015/2120, which entered into force on 29 November 2015 and amended Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 (the Roaming Regulation). Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 requires retail roaming surcharges to be abolished in the Union from 15 June 2017, subject to fair usage of roaming services and the possibility of applying a sustainability derogation mechanism of the abolition of retail roaming charges. These new rules for retail roaming services in the Union are referred to as the ‚Äòroam-like-at-home‚Äô (RLAH) rule. While necessary, the regulation at retail level alone is not sufficient to implement RLAH. National wholesale roaming markets need to be competitive and deliver wholesale roaming prices that enable operators to sustainably offer retail roaming services without any additional charges. In this regard, the Commission has undertaken a review of the wholesale roaming market, with a view to assessing measures necessary to enable the abolition of retail roaming surcharges from 15 June 2017. The review shows in particular that wholesale roaming markets do not always function properly. The impact of these market failures on the functioning of wholesale markets results in prices substantially above estimated costs, in particular for data. Another conclusion of the review is that it is not possible to anticipate with certainty the impact of the future RLAH obligation, and in particular the expected increase of roaming traffic, on competition on national wholesale roaming markets. In light of the problems identified, the Commission considers that the current measures applicable on the wholesale roaming markets should be amended to ensure that the level of wholesale roaming charges enables the sustainable provision of RLAH in the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: amongst the 4 options considered, the preferred option consisted of setting EU-wide wholesale roaming charges caps at a lower level than today. Under this option, legislation would reduce the current wholesale roaming charges caps and would also ensure that RLAH enters into force. CONTENT: this proposal for a regulation is meant to complete the rules on roaming, in particular with regard to wholesale roaming markets, in order to abolish retail roaming surcharges by 15 June 2017 without distorting the domestic visited and home markets. The Commission proposed to make the following amendments to the Roaming Regulation: add the possibility for the parties to a wholesale agreement to waive the application of maximum wholesale caps provided in Articles 7, 9 and 12 of the Roaming Regulation; reduce the current wholesale roaming charges caps to EUR 0.04 per minutes of call made, EUR 0,01 per SMS and EUR 0,0085 per megabyte of data transmitted; ensure consultation of the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) in disputes concerning inputs necessary for the provision of regulated wholesale roaming services; ensure that the Commission submits a report to the European Parliament and the Council every two years after 15 June 2017; clarify BEREC‚Äôs data-gathering powers : BEREC shall regularly collect data from national regulatory authorities on developments in retail and wholesale charges for regulated voice, SMS and data roaming services, including wholesale charges applied for balanced and unbalanced roaming traffic respectively."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Brazil entered into force on 7 August 2007. The Agreement provides that it ‚Äòshall initially be valid for a period of five years and may be renewed by agreement between the Parties after evaluation during the penultimate year of each subsequent renewal period‚Äô. The Agreement was last renewed in 2012 and remains in force until 7 August 2017, unless the Parties renew it for the next five-year period. Since the Agreement was last renewed, Brazil has made significant advances in its science, technology and innovation (STI) policy, which has contributed to the institutional strengthening of the STI system. Brazil remains at the forefront of research in the field of agriculture, as well as in tropical and infectious diseases. It is also a world-class player in the fields of information and communication technologies, nanotechnologies and energy and it hosts some of Latin America‚Äôs top universities. These research areas are of interest to the European Union. The links between Brazil and the EU in science, technology and innovation have been growing through intense cooperation at EU and Member State level. Cooperation between the EU and the Brazilian research community led, among other results, to the development of a new drug for Chagas disease (already registered with the Food and Drug Administration to start clinical testing) and to the development of a new biomass pre-treatment process for advanced bioethanol (allowing the set-up of the first commercial advanced bioethanol plant in Europe). It is, therefore, in the EU‚Äôs interest to renew the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Brazil for a new period of five years. This is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: with this proposal for a decision, it is planned to call on the Council to renew the Agreement on cooperation in the field of science and technology between the European Community and Brazil for a further period of 5 years. The content of the renewed Agreement is identical to that of the current Agreement. Cooperation would be maintained for the period from 8 August 2017 to 7 August 2022. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the implementation of the Agreement entails a financial envelope of EUR 345 000 from 2017 to 2022 for expenditure on human and administrative resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: despite the implementation of the non-discrimination principle in Directive 2006/123/EC (""Services Directive""), customers still face refusals to sell and different conditions, when buying goods or services across borders. Such abolition can be undermined by private parties putting in place obstacles inconsistent with internal market freedoms. That occurs where traders operating in one Member State block or limit the access to their online interfaces, such as websites and apps, of customers from other Member States wishing to engage in cross-border commercial transactions (a practice known as geo-blocking). It also occurs through other actions by certain traders involving the application of different general conditions of access to their goods and services with respect to such customers from other Member States, both online and offline. Such discriminatory practices are an important factor contributing to the relatively low level of cross-border commercial transactions within the Union, including in the sector of electronic commerce, which prevents the full growth potential of the internal market from being realised. This is mainly due to uncertainty over what constitutes objective criteria that justify differences in the way traders treat customers. In order to remedy this problem, the Commission considers that traders and customers should have more clarity about the situations in which differences in treatment based on residence are not justifiable. The Digital Single Market Strategy adopted in May 2015 and the Single Market Strategy adopted in October 2015 announced legislative action to address unjustified geo-blocking and comprehensively fight discrimination based on nationality or place of residence or establishment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five scenarios were envisaged. The preferred option consisted of combing increased transparency with a ban on blocking website access to website, combined with the consent-based solution banning of automatic rerouting with the definition of certain specific situations in which geo-discrimination cannot be justified (for goods, if there is no cross-border delivery by the trader; for electronically supplied services; and for services received outside the customer's Member State). CONTENT: the general objective of this proposal is to give customers better access to goods and services in the Single Market by preventing direct and indirect discrimination by traders artificially segmenting the market based on customers' residence. Scope : the material scope of the proposal is aligned with that of the Services Directive to the extent possible in order to ensure consistency and maximum legal certainty for traders and customers. This means that, inter alia, non-economic services of general interest, transport services, audiovisual services, gambling activities, healthcare services and certain social services are excluded from the scope of this Regulation. The territorial scope is designed to equally include traders established in the EU and those established in third countries but selling or seeking to sell goods and services to customers in the Union. Access to online interfaces : the proposal establishes the obligations on traders not to prevent access to their online interfaces on the basis of customers' residence. It also requires the customer's consent for rerouting and requires traders to keep the version of the online interfaces that the customer sought to access before having been rerouted easily accessible. The trader is exempted from these obligations where the access restrictions or rerouting are required by law. In these exceptional cases the trader has to provide a clear justification. Access to goods or services : the proposal sets out three specific situations under which discrimination of customers based on residence is prohibited: the first situation concerns the selling of physical goods when the trader is not involved in the delivery of the product to the Member State of the customer; the second situation concerns the provision of electronically supplied services, other than services the main feature of which is the provision of access to and use of copyright protected works or other protected subject matter; the third situation applies to services, which are provided by the trader in a Member State different from that of the customer's Member State of residence. Non-discrimination rules specifically in the context of payments : this rule provides that, in certain cases, traders cannot reject or otherwise discriminate with regards to payment instruments (such as credit or debit cards). Agreements with traders containing passive sales restrictions : the proposal provides that agreements with traders containing passive sales restrictions which would lead to violations of the rules set out in this Regulation are automatically void. It is designed to avoid circumvention of those rules by contractual means. Enforcement by Member State authorities : each Member State shall designate a body or bodies responsible for the enforcement of this Regulation. Member States shall ensure that adequate and effective means exist with the body or bodies designated in order to enforce compliance with this Regulation. Assistance to consumers : each Member State shall confer responsibility for providing practical assistance to consumers to a body or bodies in case of a dispute between a consumer and a trader arising from the application of this Regulation. Member States shall designate one or more bodies providing practical assistance to consumers in relation to disputes resulting from this Regulation. Review clause : the proposal is concerned with periodic reviews of the application of the Regulation by the Commission. Here it is specified that the first evaluation (two years after the entry into force of this Regulation) should assess, in particular, whether the prohibition of discrimination should be extended to electronically supplied services, the main feature of which is the provision of access to and use of copyright protected works or other protected subject matter, provided that the trader has the requisite rights for the relevant territories. Lastly, the proposal provides for two amendments of existing instruments relating specifically to the protection of consumers, namely Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 and Directive 2009/22/EC. This would mean that this Regulation is added in the Annexes of those legal acts so that it can also be enforced by way of the measures provided in the Consumer Protection Cooperation Regulation as well as the Injunctions Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. To tackle climate change effectively and achieve the EU's long-term decarbonisation objectives to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, an important step was taken when the European Council agreed in October 2014 the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy. A centrepiece of the 2030 policy framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. To achieve this target cost-effectively, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 while non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared to 2005. The European Council confirmed that a well-functioning, reformed EU ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market would be the main European instrument to achieve this target. This proposal is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment is largely based on the findings of the comprehensive impact assessment on the 2030 framework, focusing on certain ETS-specific methodological elements not already assessed. It includes (i) addressing the potential risk of carbon leakage, (ii) the establishment of a Modernisation and an Innovation Fund, (iii) optional free allocation to modernise the electricity sector in lower income Member States, as well as (iv) aspects building on the lessons learnt since 2013, such as the validity of emission allowances, guaranteeing a robust and secure registry and the continuation of the optional exclusion of small emitters. CONTENT : technological progress realised over time in the relevant sectors. Sectors deemed to be exposed to a risk of carbon leakage would continue to receive a higher allocation than others who have a higher ability to pass on relevant costs in product prices. maintains the Innovation Fund as a stepped-up effort to rapidly introduce new low-carbon technologies to the market enabling the EU to reach its long-term decarbonisation goals. Existing EU-level support for innovation is supplemented through dedicating 400 million allowances for these purposes. An extra 50 million allowances is added to this amount from the allowances that remain unused in 2013 to 2020 and would otherwise be placed in the Market Stability Reserve in 2020. establishes the Modernisation Fund and optional free allocation to the energy sector to contribute to the modernisation of the energy systems in lower income Member States. The Modernisation Fund is created with 2% of the overall quantity of allowances. These will be auctioned in accordance with the rules provided for in the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation to generate the necessary funds for projects to be carried out. The Commission also proposes that auction revenues should be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: EUR 14,639 million - DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: prosecuting offences against the EU budget is currently within the exclusive competence of Member States and no Union authority exists in this area. National law enforcement efforts remain often fragmented in this area and the cross-border dimension of these offences usually escapes the attention of the authorities. Despite the intensified efforts of Union bodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), coordination, cooperation and information exchange face numerous problems which are a major impediment to the effective investigation and prosecution of offences affecting the Union‚Äôs financial interests. As Member States' criminal investigation and prosecution authorities are currently unable to achieve an equivalent level of protection and enforcement, the Union not only has the competence but also the obligation to act. Article 86 of the Treaty provides the necessary legal basis for such a new Union-level prosecution system, the purpose of which is to correct the deficiencies of the current enforcement regime exclusively based on national efforts and add consistency and coordination to these efforts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the analysis of the Impact Assessment, setting up the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office as a decentralised integrated office of the Union, which relies on national judicial systems, offers the most benefits and generates the lowest costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to create a European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, as well as to lay down its competences and procedures. It complements a previous legislative proposal which defines which defines the criminal offences as well as the applicable sanctions. The main elements of the proposed Regulation are the following: Status, organisation and structure: the proposal provides for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office in the form of a Union body with a decentralised structure and with legal personality and sets out its relationship with Eurojust. Independence: among the key features of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, the text refers to its independence and accountability to the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission in regard to its activities. In this context, it lays down special rules on the appointment and dismissal of the European Public Prosecutor, his/her Deputies and European Delegated Prosecutors. Tasks and competence: the task of the European Public Prosecutor will be to combat criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union. It shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of, and accomplices in the criminal offences and for exercising the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States in respect of the offences affecting the Union‚Äôs financial interests. The proposal lays down the applicable penalties that fall within the material competence of the European Public Prosecutor. These offences are to be defined by reference to national law implementing Union law. Basic principles: the proposal describes the main legal principles that will govern the activities of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, including conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proportionality, national law being applicable to implement the Regulation, procedural neutrality, legality and celerity of investigations, Member States‚Äô duty to assist the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office. Rules of procedure on investigations, prosecutions and trial proceedings: the proposal covers the essential features of the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, including provisions on how they should be controlled by national courts, what decisions the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office could take once the investigation is completed, how it would exercise its prosecution functions and how the evidence collected would be used in trial courts. Procedural safeguards: the proposal provides safeguards for suspects and other persons involved in the proceedings of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, which will need to comply with the relevant standards, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. With regard to certain rights ‚Äì right to interpretation and translation; right to information in criminal proceedings; right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and the right to communicate upon arrest ‚Äì the rules refer to Union legislation. The proposal also defines autonomously other rights which have not yet been regulated in Union legislation, such as the right to remain silent and the right to be presumed innocent, the right to legal aid, the right to present evidence, appoint experts and hear witnesses. As such, these rules provide an additional layer of protection compared to national law. The proposal also lays down the rules governing the data protection regime. The supervision of all personal data processing in the context of the activities of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office has been entrusted to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal seeks to be cost-efficient for the EU budget: part of OLAF's current resources will be used for setting up the central headquarters of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office, which in turn will rely on the administrative support of Eurojust. Limited additional costs will arise in relation to the position of the European Delegated Prosecutors who will be located in the Member States and will be an integral part of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. As the set-up phase of the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office will probably take several years, staff members will be gradually transferred from OLAF to the European Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office. The European Public Prosecutor's Office will reach cruising speed once the full staff levels are achieved. The full staff level will be achieved in 2023 with 235 staff, of which 180 establishment plan posts and 55 external staff. The estimated cost for 2023 with this staff level is approximately EUR 35 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in its in its Communication of September 2016 entitled 'Enhancing security in a world of mobility‚Äô, the Commission confirmed the need to strike the right balance between ensuring mobility and enhancing security, while facilitating legal entry into the Schengen area without the need for a visa. Today, around 1.4 billion people from around 60 countries worldwide can benefit from visa-free travel to the European Union. The number of visa-exempt third country nationals to the Schengen countries will continue to grow, with an expected increase of over 30% in the number of visa exempt third country nationals crossing the Schengen borders by 2020, from 30 million in 2014 to 39 million in 2020. These figures demonstrate the need to put in place a system that is able to achieve objectives similar to the visa regime, namely to assess and manage the potential irregular migration and security risks represented by third country nationals visiting the EU, yet in a lighter and more visitor-friendly way, in line with the objectives of the EU's visa liberalisation policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the ETIAS legal proposal is based on the results of the feasibility study conducted from June till October 2016. CONTENT: the draft regulation proposes the establishment of the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which will be an EU system for visa-exempt third country nationals when crossing the external borders, and allow determination of whether the presence of such persons on the territory of the Member States would pose an irregular migration, security or public health risk. For this purpose a travel authorisation would be introduced as a new condition for entering the Schengen area and the absence of a valid ETIAS travel authorisation would result in a refusal of entry into the Schengen area. Moreover, where applicable, carriers would have to check that their passengers have a valid ETIAS travel authorisation before allowing them to board their transportation means bound to a Schengen country. Prior to the intended travel, the applicant will create an on-line application, via a dedicated website or the mobile application. Functions: the key functions of ETIAS will be to: Scope: ETIAS will apply to visa-exempt third country nationals. The following shall be excluded from the scope: holders of long-stay visas, holders of a local border traffic permits, citizens of the micro-states in the Schengen area, holders of diplomatic passports and crew members of ships or aircraft while on duty. Management of the system: the ETIAS will be managed by the European Border and Coast Guard in close cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States and Europol. The Agency eu-LISA will develop and provide technical management of this information system. The final decision on allowing entry into the Schengen Area will still rest with the border guards at the external border in line with the Schengen Border Code. Participation: the proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis; therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland do not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application. Denmark shall decide within six months of the Council‚Äôs decision on this Regulation whether to transpose it into national law or not. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the amount needed has been assessed as EUR 212.1 million. During the development phase (2018-2020), the Commission will spend a total amount of EUR 4.2 million (via shared management) for the expenses related to operations in Member States. From 2020, when the new system will be operational, future operational costs in Member States could be supported by their national programmes in the framework of shared management. From the same year, the ETIAS System will generate fee revenue, which will be treated as external assigned revenue. Based on the current estimates of the number of applications, the fee revenue will more than cover the direct development and running cost of the ETIAS. In turn, this will allow the financing of related expenditure in the field of Smart Borders. DELEGATED ACTS: in order to establish the technical measures needed for the application of the Regulation, the Commission will have the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: on 9 June 2017, the Council agreed a general approach on ETIAS. The general approach constitutes the Council's position for negotiations with the European Parliament. For legal reasons, it was decided to split the proposal into two texts (2016/357A(COD) and 2016/357B(COD)) given that the proposal contains a formal amendment of the Europol Regulation in order to give Europol new tasks. Europol does not belong to the Schengen acquis while ETIAS will fully belong to the Schengen acquis as regards external borders. Given the differentiated geometry (Europol with 27 Member States, without Denmark and ETIAS 26 Members States, including Denmark but without the United Kingdom and Ireland), it is necessary to split the proposal into two texts to allow a differentiated participation and vote in the Council. It should be stressed that this splitting shall not in any way affect the substance of ETIAS. CONTENT: more specifically, as regards the amendment to the Europol Regulation which is the aim of this proposal, the tasks of Europol shall be extended to cover the following tasks: develop and host the ETIAS watchlist (people suspected to have committed, or be likely to commit a criminal offence); provide information to the ETIAS as regards terrorist offences or other serious criminal offences; provide an opinion following a consultation request from the ETIAS National Unit of the responsible Member State in cases falling under Europol's mandate. As regards to information stored by Europol, the amended text stipulates that Europol shall take all appropriate measures to enable the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to have direct access on the basis of a hit/no hit system to information as regards the processing of personal data. In the case of a hit, Europol shall initiate the procedure by which the information that generated the hit may be shared and only to the extent that the data generating the hit are necessary for the performance of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency tasks related to ETIAS."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the eu-LISA Agency - established by Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011, amended in 2015 by Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 - currently manages the Visa Information System (VIS), second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and Eurodac (for the comparison of fingerprints). The first evaluation of the Agency's work, carried out in 2015-2016 on the basis of an independent external evaluation, concluded that the eu-LISA agency effectively carried out the operational management of large-scale IT systems as well as the other tasks entrusted to it, but also that a number of amendments to its establishing Regulation were necessary. In the light of this assessment, the Commission proposes to extend the mandate of the eu-LISA agency by entrusting it to: provide technical solutions needed to ensure interoperability between large-scale IT systems; develop and manage the future large-scale IT systems of the EU. The proposal follows on from the Commission Communication of 6 April 2016 entitled 'Stronger and smarter information systems for borders and security', the High Level Expert Group's final report of 11 May 2017 and in the Commission's Seventh progress report towards an effective and genuine Security Union of 16 May 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is based to a large extent on the results and recommendations of the independent external evaluation report of the Agency‚Äôs work. No impact assessment was carried out since the evaluation concluded that the amendments are essentially technical in nature. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to review the Regulation establishing the eu-LISA Agency in order to adapt it to the recommendations for legislative amendments stemming from the evaluation, as well as to improve the functioning of the Agency and enhance and strengthen its role to ensure that its mandate meets current challenges at EU level in the area of freedom, security and justice. The tasks of the new eu-LISA agency would be as follows: Ensuring the centralised operational management of EU information systems : subject to the adoption of legislative instruments proposed by the Commission, eu-LISA would also be responsible for the preparation, development and operational management of the Entry/Exit System (EES), DubliNet, the European Travel Authorisation System (ETIAS), the automated system for registration, monitoring and the allocation mechanism for applications for international protection and the ECRIS-TCN system. Developing the necessary actions to enable interoperability : the Agency shall be tasked with the development of a European Search Portal, a shared biometric matching service and a Common Identity Repository, subject to the adoption of the relevant legislative instrument on interoperability. Where relevant, any actions carried out on interoperability should have to be guided by the Commission Communication on the European interoperability framework ‚Äì implementation strategy. Ensuring data quality : subject to the adoption of specific legislative amendments/proposals, the proposal entrusts the Agency with the task of setting up automated data quality control mechanisms and common data quality indicators, as well as developing a central repository for reporting and statistics. The purpose of such mechanisms would be to enable central systems to automatically identify apparently incorrect or inconsistent data submissions so that the originating Member State is able to verify the data and carry out any necessary remedial actions. Providing assistance to Member States and the Commission : the Agency may provide advice and/or assistance to the Commission on technical matters relating to existing or new systems, including through studies and testing. It could be responsible for developing, managing or hosting a common IT system by a group of at least six Member States voluntarily opting for a centralised solution. The proposal also specifies the tasks to be entrusted to the Management Board and to the Executive Director, whose mandate may be extended for a period not exceeding five years, in accordance with the Common Approach on decentralised agencies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: for the Agency to adequately address its new tasks, from 2018 to 2020 an amount of EUR 78.354 million will need to be added to the Agency's Union subsidy. This amount does not include the budget required for the new systems which is foreseen under the relevant legislative proposals nor that required for the proposals amending existing systems."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the European Union has already approved the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol and the four previous amendments to the Protocol. At the 28th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, which took place in Kigali, Rwanda, from 10th to 15th October 2016, the text of an amendment to that Protocol (the Kigali amendment) was adopted, adding a stepwise reduction of the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) to the control measures of the Montreal Protocol. A stepwise reduction of the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons is necessary to reduce the contribution of those substances to climate change and to prevent their unlimited introduction, in particular in developing countries. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the adoption by the Council of a decision on the conclusion of the agreement to amend the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, adopted in Kigali on 15 October 2016. The text of the Kigali amendment divides countries into three groups based on when they should reduce the use of HFCs: the first group, which includes the most economically developed countries, must implement the first reductions in HFCs during the period 2019-2023 and undertake to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% by 2036, compared to the period 2011-2013 as a reference; a second group of countries will freeze its HFC consumption and production between 2024 and 2028 and commit to reducing its consumption by 80% by 2045; the remaining countries will freeze their consumption and production by 2028 and 2031. Together, countries will have to reduce HFC levels by 85% by 2047. The Kigali Amendment will enter into force on 1 January 2019, provided that at least 20 parties have deposited their instruments of ratification. The envisaged phase-down of HFCs is implemented through Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 that will have to be revised at a later stage in order to ensure compliance with the Kigali Amendment beyond 2030. Until 2030, the last year for which the Regulation determines a reduction step, the phase-down schedule is stricter than the future control measures under the Montreal Protocol."

BACKGROUND: the Union is a party to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution as well as to the 1999 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-Level Ozone ('the Gothenburg Protocol'). The parties to the Gothenburg Protocol opened negotiations with a view to improving further the protection of human health and the environment, including through the establishment of new emission reduction obligations for selected air pollutants to be achieved by the year 2020 and the updating of emission limit values addressing emissions of air pollutants at source. In 2012, the Protocol was modified and two new annexes added. The Amendments set out in Decision 2012/1 entered into force and became effective on the basis of the expedited procedure provided for in the Gothenburg Protocol.

The proposed Amendment to the 1999 protocol sets out new national emission reduction commitments for 2020 onwards. It covers four air pollutants: sulphur, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds (VOC) other than methane, and particulate matter. In particular, the amendment includes: (i) emission reductions for black carbon; (ii) an update of the emission limit values set in the annex to the protocol; (iii) new standards on the content of non-methane VOC's in products."

BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Cuba are currently governed by the EU's Common Position 96/697/CFSP of 2 December 1996. On 10 February 2014, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to open negotiations for a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part. The negotiations began on 29 April 2014 and were concluded after seven rounds in March 2016. The Agreement was initialled on 11 March 2016 in Havana, in the presence of the High Representative and the Commissioner for International Development and Cooperation. The European Parliament was also kept informed throughout the negotiations. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the 2010 Commission report on the protection of the Union's financial interests, suspected fraud amounts to approximately 600 million euro annually on the revenue and expenditure side despite the legal framework in place. It can be assumed that the actual amount is even higher as not all cases are detected and reported. The damage to the EU budget calls for action to ensure equivalent and effective protection of the Union's financial interests, including criminal law as far as this proves necessary. Despite the development of an EU acquis in this area which includes fraud, corruption and money laundering, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection within their national legal systems. According to the Commission, the actual common definition of offences in all Member States would reduce the risks of divergent practice, as they would ensure a uniform interpretation and a homogeneous way to meet all the necessary prosecution requirements. They would also strengthen the deterrent effect and enforcement potential of relevant provisions The proposal follows on from the Commission‚Äôs May 2011 communication ‚ÄúOn the protection of the Union‚Äôs financial interests by criminal law and by administrative investigations‚Äù and the September 2011 communication ‚ÄúTowards a European criminal policy: Ensuring the effective implementation of EU policies through criminal law‚Äù. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the outcome of an external study which was completed in February 2012. The impact assessment concludes that a solution which in particular would extend the types of some fraud-related offences, introduce minimum sanctions and harmonise statutory limitation is to be preferred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces the proposal for a Directive on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests. It seeks to set out harmonised criminal law provisions in the field of the protection of the Union's financial interests, while allowing Member States a certain degree of flexibility as regards how to impose more stringent provisions. In particular, the proposal: introduces a definition of the Union‚Äôs financial interests (fraud in relation to VAT is considered as affecting the EU's financial interests and is therefore covered by this proposed Directive); provides a definition of fraudulent behaviour to be criminalised in the Member States; provides that dishonest conduct of tenderers in public procurement is to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of corruption to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of misappropriation, which covers conduct by public officials that does not constitute fraud in a stricter sense, and which consists in the misappropriation of funds or assets contrary to the purpose foreseen, with the intention to damage the Union's financial interests; makes reference to anti-money laundering legislation (Directive 2005/60/EC) with respect to money-laundering of the proceeds of the offences, so that such money laundering will be criminalised in the Member States; requires Member States to criminalise also forms of preparation of and participation in the offences of incitement, aiding and abetting, attempt; requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons; requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, and to set out a certain minimum set of criminal sanctions for natural persons; requires certain minimum imprisonment terms for particularly serious offences, based on thresholds set out for each offence; requires the existence of means of freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities from these offences; requires the Member States to take the necessary measures to establish their competence bases in regard to criminal offences so as to allow the judicial authorities to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to the Union's financial interests. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this proposal has no immediate budgetary implications for the Union. Its aim is, however, to prevent losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests by increasing deterrence and making enforcement by criminal law authorities of the Member States more effective, as well as to facilitate recovery in cases where losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests have already occurred."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 82/891/EEC, Council Directive 89/666/EEC, Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council have been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, whilst stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, this proposal seeks to codify the following directives: Sixth Council Directive concerning the division of public limited liability companies (82/891/EEC), Eleventh Council Directive concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State (89/666/EEC), Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive lays down measures concerning the following: the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital; the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States concerning disclosure requirements in respect of public and private limited liability companies; the disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State; mergers of public limited liability companies; cross-border mergers of limited liability companies; the division of public limited liability companies. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the adoption and entry into force of international rules on liability for non-contractual damages arising from the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) by sea is crucial in view of the significant share HNS cargo represents in maritime freight transport worldwide. The International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, ('1996 HNS Convention') was aimed at ensuring adequate, prompt and effective compensation of persons who suffer damage caused by spills of hazardous and noxious substances, when carried by sea.

The 2010 Protocol and the provisions of the Convention, are to be read, interpreted and applied together as one single instrument. Neither the 1996 HNS Convention, nor the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention has entered into force. The latter has no contracting parties to it to this day. The 2010 Protocol, and thereby the consolidated 2010 HNS Convention, will enter into force 18 months after the date on which at least 12 States, 4 of which with no less than 2 million units of gross tonnage each, have ratified it, and the relevant data on contributing cargo have been submitted to the IMO Secretary-General showing no less than 40 million tonnes of cargo contributing to the general HNS account received in total in those States during the preceding calendar year. The main changes from the 1996 HNS Convention to the 2010 HNS Convention are: Given that issues related to judicial to judicial cooperation in civil matters do not apply to Denmark, the Council must adopt two separate decisions.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the current EU regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices ('IVDs') consists of Directive 98/79/EC. It has demonstrated its merits but has also come under criticism in recent years. In an internal market with 32 participating countries and subject to constant scientific and technological progress, substantial divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules have emerged, thus undermining the main objectives of the Directive, i.e. the safety and performance of IVDs and their free movement. Triggered Resolution on defective silicone gel breast implants this revision of the current regulatory framework aims to overcome the flaws and gaps and to further strengthen patient safety. It aims to put in place a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that is 'fit for purpose'. The framework is supportive of innovation and the competitiveness of the in vitro diagnostic medical device industry and should allow rapid and cost-efficient market access for innovative IVDs to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals. It should be noted that this proposal is adopted alongside a proposal for a Regulation on medical devices that are currently covered by the AIMDD and the MDD. While the specific features of IVDs and of the IVD sector require the adoption of a specific legislation distinct from the legislation on other medical devices, the horizontal aspects common to both sectors have been aligned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : to a large extent, the scope of the proposed Regulation matches the scope of Directive 98/79/EC, i.e. it covers in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The proposed changes clarify and extend the scope of the IVD Directive. They concern: ¬∑  high-risk devices manufactured and used within a single health institution, which are subject to most of the requirements set out in the proposal; ¬∑  tests providing information about the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease (e.g. genetic tests) and tests providing information to predict treatment response or reactions (e.g. companion diagnostics), which are considered as in vitro diagnostic medical devices; ¬∑  medical software, which is explicitly mentioned in the definition of IVDs. To support Member States and the Commission in determining the regulatory status of products, the Commission may set up, in accordance with its internal rules, a group of experts from various sectors (such as IVDs, medical devices, medicinal products, human tissues and cells, cosmetics and biocides). Definitions: this section has been significantly extended, aligning the definitions in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices with well-established European and international practice. Making available of devices, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement: t his chapter covers mainly horizontal issues similar for both medical devices and IVDs. It contains provisions that are typical for product-related internal market legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives of non-EU manufacturers, importers and distributors). It also provides clarification with regard to the adoption and the scope of common technical specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The legal obligations on manufacturers are proportionate to the risk class of the devices they produce. The following concepts are new in the field of IVDs: ¬∑  a requirement has been introduced that within the manufacturer's organisation a 'qualified person' should be responsible for regulatory compliance. Similar requirements exist in EU legislation on medicinal products and in the national laws transposing the Directive on medical devices in some Member States. ¬∑  since in the case of 'parallel trade' with in vitro diagnostic medical devices application of the principle of free movement of goods varies considerably from one Member State to another and, in many cases, de facto prohibits this practice, clear conditions are set for enterprises involved in relabelling and/or repackaging IVDs. Identification and traceability of devices, registration of devices and of economic operators, summary of safety and performance, Eudamed: this chapter addresses one of the main shortcomings of the current system: its lack of transparency. It consists of the following requirements: Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for notified bodies. It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies, based on stricter and detailed criteria laid down in Annex VI, with the individual Member State . Any new designation and, in regular intervals, the monitoring of notified bodies are made subject to 'joint assessments' with experts from other Member States and the Commission, thus ensuring an effective control at Union level. At intervals. Classification and conformity assessment : the proposal introduces a new risk-rule based classification system, built on GHTF principles, which replaces the current list of IVD medical devices in Annex II to Directive 98/79/EC. In the new classification system, IVDs will be divided into four classes of risk : A (lowest risk), B, C and D (highest risk). The conformity assessment procedures have been adapted to match each of these four device classes. The proposal tightens and streamlines the different conformity assessment procedures during which the notified body audits the manufacturer's quality management system, checks the technical documentation, examines the design dossier or approves the type of a device. These are laid down in Annexes VIII to X. One conformity assessment procedure provided for under the IVD Directive (EC verification) has been deleted and the concept of batch testing has been clarified. The proposal also: ¬∑  Clinical evidence: the proposal spells out the requirements for clinical evidence for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that are proportionate to the risk class. The key obligations are set out in Chapter VI while more detailed provisions are laid down in Annex XII. While most clinical performance studies follow an observational design and therefore the results obtained are not used for patient management and do not impact treatment decisions, specific requirements have been introduced in Annex XIII for the conduct of interventional clinical performance studies and other clinical performance studies where the conduct of the study, including specimen collection, involves invasive procedures or other risks for the subjects of the studies. The concept of 'sponsor' is introduced. The scope of the proposal remains restricted to clinical performance studies carried out for regulatory purposes, i.e. for obtaining or confirming regulatory approval for market access. Non-commercial clinical performance studies that do not pursue a regulatory purpose are not covered by this Regulation. Every interventional clinical performance study and other clinical performance study involving risks for the subjects of the study shall be registered in a publicly accessible electronic system which the Commission will set up. Vigilance and market surveillance : Governance : a central role in achieving harmonised interpretation and practice will be assigned to an expert committee (the Medical Device Coordination Group or MDCG) made up of members appointed by the Member States due to their role and experience in the fields of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices and set up by Regulation on medical devices. The proposal mandates the Commission to provide technical, scientific and logistic support to the MDCG. It empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, either implementing acts to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, or delegated acts to complement the regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices over time. The future Regulation will replace and repeal Directive 98/79/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council laid down harmonised principles and rules on the prospectus to be drawn up, approved and published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market. The Directive, which was revised in 2010 (Directive 2010/73/EU), aimed to make it easier and cheaper for companies to raise capital throughout the Union. Prospectuses are legally required documents presenting information about a company. This information aims to be the basis on which investors can decide whether to invest in a variety of securities issued by that company. A harmonised EU prospectus is an essential tool to integrate capital markets throughout the Union. Once the competent authority of an EEA Member State approves a prospectus, this prospectus can be used to raise capital by means of a public offer or admission to a regulated market in other Member States. Although the prospectus regime functions well overall, the Commission‚Äôs evaluation of the Directive in 2015 shows that certain requirements of the Prospectus Directive might still be improved to alleviate administrative burden for companies which draw up a prospectus (especially SMEs) and to make the prospectus a more valuable information tool for potential investors. The reform of the prospectus rules was announced in the Investment Plan for Europe and is an important step to build the Capital Markets Union. It aims particularly to: (i) reduce fragmentation in financial markets; (ii) increase investor protection in capital markets. The purpose of the revision of the Prospectus Directive is to provide all types of issuers with disclosure rules, which are tailored to their specific needs while making the prospectus a more relevant tool of informing potential investors. The proposed measures aim to: reduce the administrative burden of drawing up of prospectus for all issuers, in particular for SMEs, frequent issuers of securities and secondary issuances; make the prospectus a more relevant disclosure tool for potential investors, especially in SMEs; and achieve more convergence between the EU prospectus and other EU disclosure rules. In order to do this, the Commission proposes to transform the Directive into a Regulation in order to enhance coherence and integration throughout the internal market, while reducing divergent and fragmented rules across the Union, in coherence with the goals of the Capital Markets Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment provides a summary of the different alleviations and investor protection measures chosen as well as their impact on relevant stakeholders and the overall market in which these stakeholders operate. It concludes that the proposed ""package"" will result in a reduction in the administrative burden for issuers, will make access to capital markets for SMEs easier and cheaper and improve investor protection by improving the appropriateness of the disclosure documents and ultimately enlarging choice of prospectus-based securities. This should then translate into further integration of capital markets in the Union in the form of more prospectus-based securities being offered across borders and greater transparency and comparability. CONTENT: the new proposal for a regulation aims to modernise the prospectus rules to facilitate raising money and simplify information for investors. It introduces the following main changes with regard to the current Directive: Scope of the prospectus obligation (new thresholds): the proposal provides that no prospectus is required under this Regulation for offers of securities with a consideration below EUR 500 000. Furthermore, Member States will also be able to set higher thresholds for their domestic markets, and the proposal doubles this threshold from EUR 5 million to EUR 10 million. Definitions: the main change concerns the definition of SME, thereby raising to EUR 200 million the EUR 100 million threshold that previously defined ""companies with reduced market capitalisation"". Prospectus summary : this should be modelled as much as possible after the key information document required under Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and is subject to a maximum length of 6 sides of A4- sized paper when printed (characters of readable size must be used). Liability attaches to the summary only if it is misleading, inaccurate or inconsistent when read together with the other parts of the prospectus. The base prospectus : a base prospectus may now be drawn up for any kind of non-equity securities, not only for those issued under an offering programme or in a continuous and repeated way by credit institutions. Base prospectuses consisting of several documents (the so-called ""tripartite prospectus"") are now possible, and the registration document of a base prospectus may take the form of a universal registration document. The universal registration document : the proposal contains detailed rules on the new ""universal registration document"", an optional shelf registration mechanism for ""frequent issuers"" admitted to trading on regulated markets or multilateral trading facilities. The competent authority should be able to scrutinise the remaining documents (securities note and summary) within 5 working days, instead of the current 10. Simplifying secondary issuance for listed firms : issuers whose securities are already listed on a regulated market (this category accounts for around 70% of all prospectuses approved in a given year), or the future SME growth market, should enjoy the benefit of an alleviated prospectus for their secondary issuances. The alleviated regime for secondary issuances will apply to offers or admissions concerning securities issued by companies already admitted to trading on a regulated market or an SME growth market for at least 18 months. Specific disclosure regime for SMEs : the specific regime for SMEs will allow these companies to draw up a distinct prospectus in case of an offer of securities to the public. This kind of prospectus should however not be available to SMEs admitted to trading on regulated markets to avoid creating a two-tier disclosure standard on regulated markets which might undermine investor confidence. In addition, a new optional ""question and answer"" format is expected to help SMEs in drawing up their own prospectus, thus saving considerable legal fees. Treatment of non-equity securities with a high denomination per unit : the favourable treatment granted by the Prospectus Directive to non-equity securities with a denomination per unit of EUR 100 000 or above have led to unintended consequences, creating distortions in the European bond markets and making a significant share of bonds issued by investment-grade companies inaccessible to a wider number of investors. The proposal therefore removes the incentives to issue debt securities in large denominations with a view to removing one of the barriers to secondary liquidity on European bond markets. For non-equity securities admitted to trading on a regulated market, the dual standard of disclosure (retail / wholesale) is removed. Furthermore, the prospectus exemption for offers of securities with a denomination above EUR 100 000 is removed. Publication of the prospectus : the prospectus shall be deemed available to the public when published in electronic form either on the website of the issuer, the offeror or the person asking for admission (or, if applicable, of the financial intermediaries placing or selling the securities) or on the website of the regulated market where the admission to trading is sought, or of the operator of the multilateral trading facility. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will develop an online storage mechanism with a search tool that EU investors may use for free. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will have budgetary implications for ESMA (EUR 3.884 million for the period 2016-2019) in two respects: (i) ESMA will have to prepare regulatory and implementing technical standards and (ii) it will have to upgrade its existing prospectus register and to transform it into an online storage mechanism with a search tool that the public can use for free to access and compare EU prospectuses from a single location. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Eurojust was set up by Council Decision 2002/187/JHA to reinforce the fight against serious organised crime in the European Union. Ever since, Eurojust has facilitated coordination and cooperation between national investigative and prosecutorial authorities in dealing with cases affecting various Member States. These years have witnessed the continued growth of the organisation into what is now a central player in judicial cooperation in criminal matters. In parallel, the fight against organised crime and the disruption of criminal organisations remain a daily challenge. Combatting them effectively therefore requires a coordinated pan-european response. In this context, Eurojust's role in improving judicial cooperation and coordination between competent judicial authorities of Member States and assisting investigations involving third countries remains crucial. Under the Lisbon Treaty, new possibilities to enhance Eurojust's efficiency in tackling these forms of criminality have been introduced . Article 85 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) explicitly recognises Eurojust's mission and provides for Eurojust's structure, operation, field of action and tasks to be determined by regulations adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure. It also requires that they determine arrangements for involving the European Parliament and national Parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities. Against this background, it is proposed to repeal the Regulation establishing Eurojust by creating a new legal framework in view of the creation of an EU Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) which is the legal successor of Eurojust. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no formal impact assessment was undertaken. However, the Commission organised a consultative meeting with Member State experts, representatives of the Council Secretariat, the European Parliament and Eurojust to discuss issues related to a possible reform under Article 85 TFUE. The issues included: strengthened governance, parliamentary involvement at European and national level, possible additional powers, links with the development of the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). The meeting generally supported improving Eurojust's governance structure and efficiency. LEGAL BASIS: Article 85 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims to establish a European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust) and to repeal Decisions 2002/187/JHA, 2003/659/JHA and 2009/426/JHA. Objectives : the main objectives of the proposals are to: increase Eurojust's efficiency through providing it with a new governance structure; improve Eurojust's operational effectiveness through homogeneously defining the status and powers of National Members; provide for a role for the European Parliament and national Parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities in line with the Lisbon Treaty; bring Eurojust's legal framework in line with the Common Approach, whilst fully respecting its special role regarding the coordination of on-going criminal investigations; ensure that Eurojust can cooperate closely with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, once this is established. Tasks and competences : the proposal defines the tasks and competences of the future European Agency. These are outlined in the Annex to the draft Regulation. It should be noted that Eurojust shall enjoy the most extensive legal capacity accorded to legal persons under their laws. Organisation of Eurojust : Eurojust's national members : the reform maintains their link to their Member State of origin but at the same time explicitly lists the operational powers they shall all have. This will allow them to cooperate with each other and with national authorities in a more effective way. Structure : it has set up the new structure of Eurojust by respectively regulating the College, the Executive Board and the Administrative Director. Eurojust's governance is improved by clearly distinguishing between two compositions of the College, depending on whether it exercises operational or management functions. The former refer to the core business of Eurojust in supporting and coordinating national investigations. The latter are related for example to the adoption of the agency's work programme, annual budget or the Annual report. A new organ, the Executive Board, is set up to prepare the College's management decisions and to directly assume some administrative tasks. The Commission is represented in the College when it exercises its management functions and in the Executive Board. Finally, the appointment procedure, responsibilities and tasks of the Administrative Director are clearly spelled out. This introduces a double degree of governance as foreseen in the Common Approach whilst maintaining Eurojust's special nature and safeguarding its independence. It is also cost-effective, and contributes to Eurojust's efficiency, as national members will be assisted in budgetary and administrative matters, which will allow them to focus on their operational tasks. Operational matters : existing mechanisms for the operational effectiveness of Eurojust, including the On-call Coordination (OCC), the Eurojust National Coordination System (ENCS), the exchanges of information and follow-up to Eurojust's requests are maintained. The architecture of the Eurojust Case Management System also remains the same. Processing of Information and protection of personal data : the proposal complements the existing provision on the data protection by Eurojust. It complements Regulation 45/2001 as far as operational personal data are concerned, respecting the specificity of judicial cooperation activities while taking into account the need for consistency and compatibility with the relevant data protection principles. Restrictions on the processing of personal data continue to be possible. The proposal also aligns the provisions on the rights of the data subjects with Regulation 45/2001 and takes into account the standards of protection foreseen in the data protection reform package, adopted by the Commission in January 2012. Furthermore, it foresees an important change in the supervision mechanism. It establishes the responsibilities of the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) as regards the monitoring of all personal data processing at Eurojust. The EDPS will take over the tasks of the Joint Supervisory Body established under the Eurojust Council Decision. Relations with partners : the proposal reflects the importance of partnership and cooperation between Eurojust and other EU institutions, bodies and agencies in the fight against crime. In particular, it focuses on: the relations with the Secretariats of the European Judicial Network, the Joint Investigation Teams Expert Network and the Genocide Network, which are hosted by Eurojust; specific provision on relations with the European Public Prosecutor's Office; the privileged relationship between the two agencies in order to increase their effectiveness in combating serious forms of international crime within their competence. This includes a mechanism for cross-checking of their respective information systems and the ensuing exchange of data; links with third countries : the Lisbon Treaty has changed the way in which the European Union conducts its external relations, and these changes also affect the agencies. As a consequence, agencies will no longer be able to negotiate international agreements themselves ‚Äì such agreements will have to be established in accordance with Article 218 TFEU. However, Eurojust will be able to conclude working arrangements to enhance cooperation with competent authorities of third countries, including by exchanging information. Financial provisions : provisions aim to modernise Eurojust's budget, its establishment and implementation, presentation of accounts and discharge provisions. Staff : a number of provisions have been made as regards Eurojust staff. Eurojust's hybrid nature and the importance of the operational link between national desks and their Member States of origin explain that salaries and emoluments of such staff are borne by the Member States. Eurojust's Administrative Director is still appointed by the College of Eurojust but on the basis of a shortlist drawn up by the Commission, following an open and transparent selection procedure. This respects the autonomy of the agency whilst guaranteeing a rigorous evaluation of candidates. A similar procedure is foreseen for dismissal of the Administrative Director. Evaluation and Reporting : the proposal spells out the involvement of the European Parliament and national parliaments in the evaluation of Eurojust's activities. This is done in a cost-effective way, on the basis of Eurojust's Annual Report, whilst preserving Eurojust's operational independence. A periodic overall evaluation of Eurojust is also provided every five years. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no cost implications of the governance reform (""management board"" back to back with the College) and there are no new tasks foreseen for Eurojust in this proposal, other than supporting the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which will be done on a zero cost basis."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: after the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, confiscation was given strategic priority at EU level as an effective instrument to fight organised crime. Directive 2014/42/EU establishes common minimum rules for the freezing and confiscation of instrumentalities and proceeds of crime in the European Union. Based on the European Agenda on Security of 28 April 2015 which highlighted the need for measures to address terrorist financing in a more effective and comprehensive manner, the Commission adopted, in February 2016, a communication on an action plan for strengthening the fight against terrorist financing, highlighting the need to ensure that criminals who fund terrorism are deprived of their assets. In October 2016, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the fight against corruption which once again called on the Commission to submit a proposal on the strengthening of mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders. Recent research estimates that illicit markets in the European Union generate about EUR 110 billion, i.e. approximately 1% of the EU's GDP in 2010. However, and although existing statistics are limited, the amount of money currently being recovered from proceeds of crime within the EU is only a small proportion: 98.9% of estimated criminal profits are not confiscated and remain at the disposal of criminals. The implementation reports on Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA and Framework Decision 2006/783/JHA were adopted in 2008 and 2010. A comparative law study on the implementation of mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders in the EU20 was carried out in 2013 and concluded that one coherent instrument for mutual recognition could be envisaged. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option of the Commission is a mutual recognition instrument with an extended scope and improved provisions that ensure a wider circulation of freezing and confiscation orders issued within the framework of criminal proceedings in the European Union. The requirement to recognise a greater range of freezing and confiscation orders should increase the amount of criminal assets frozen and seized across Member State borders. CONTENT: based on existing EU legislation on mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders, the proposed Regulation lays down the rules under which a Member State shall recognise and execute in its territory a freezing or a confiscation order issued by another Member State within the framework of criminal proceedings. This proposal covers all confiscation orders imposed by a court following proceedings in relation to a criminal offence and all freezing orders issued with a view to possible subsequent confiscation. It covers all criminal offences. It is not limited to the areas of particularly serious crime with a cross-border dimension so-called ‚ÄòEurocrimes‚Äô. The proposed Regulation seeks to improve the current mutual recognition legal framework in several ways: apply directly a legal instrument in the Member States to improve mutual recognition of freezing and confiscation orders bringing clarity and eliminating problems with transposition into national systems; extend the scope compared to the current mutual recognition instruments and Directive 2014/42/EU: the proposed Regulation will cover third-party confiscation and criminal non-conviction based confiscation, for instance in the cases of death of a person, immunity, prescription, cases where the perpetrator of an offence cannot be identified. This requires the court to establish that an advantage was derived from a criminal offence; set clear deadlines for freezing and confiscation orders : the executing authority must take the decision on the recognition and execution of the freezing order as soon as possible and at the latest within 24 hours after the receipt of the freezing order. The executing authority must take the decision on the recognition and execution of the confiscation order as soon as possible and not later than 30 days after the receipt of the confiscation order. improve the speed and efficiency of the mechanism thanks to a standardised certificate for mutual recognition of confiscation orders and a standard form for freezing orders which are annexed to the proposal; ensure that, in cases where the issuing State confiscates property, the victim‚Äôs right to compensation and restitution has priority over the executing and issuing States‚Äô interest. introduce a general obligation of competent authorities to consult each other where necessary during the mutual recognition procedure. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: currently, data localisation restrictions by Member States' public authorities and obstacles to the movement of data across IT systems prevent business and organisations in the EU from capturing economic, social and business opportunities. Legal uncertainty and lack of trust cause additional barriers to the free flow of non-personal data. In practice, this means a business may not be or feel free to make full use of cloud services, choose the most cost-effective locations for IT resources, switch between service providers or port its data back to their own IT systems. With the principle of free flow of non-personal data, businesses can avoid duplication of data at several locations, may feel more confident to enter new markets, and scale up their activities more easily. The Mid-Term Review on the implementation of the Digital Single Market Strategy (DSM Strategy) announced a legislative proposal on an EU free flow of data cooperation framework. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option chosen allows for the assessment of a combination of legislation establishing the free flow of data framework and the single points of contact and an expert group as well as self-regulatory measures addressing data porting. This option would ensure the effective removal of existing unjustified localisation restrictions and would effectively prevent the future ones, as a result of a clear legal principle combined with the review, notification and transparency, while at the same time enhancing legal certainty and trust in the market. The burden on Member States' public authorities would be modest, leading to approximately EUR 33 000 annually in terms of human resources cost to sustain the single points of contact as well as a yearly cost of between EUR 385 and EUR 1925 for the preparation of notifications CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to ensure the free movement of data other than personal data within the Union by laying down rules relating to data localisation requirements, the availability of data to competent authorities and data porting for professional users. It shall apply to the storage or other processing of electronic data other than personal data in the Union, which is (a) provided as a service to users residing or having an establishment in the Union, regardless of whether the provider is established or not in the Union or (b) carried out by a natural or legal person residing or having an establishment in the Union for its own needs. The proposal: establishes the principle of free movement of non-personal data in the Union. This principle prohibits any data localisation requirement, unless it is justified on grounds of public security. Furthermore, it provides for the review of existing requirements, notification of remaining or new requirements to the Commission and transparency measures; ensures data availability for regulatory control by competent authorities. To this effect, users may not refuse to provide access to data to competent authorities on the basis that data is stored or otherwise processed in another Member State. Where a competent authority has exhausted all applicable means to obtain access to the data, that competent authority may request the assistance of an authority in another Member State, if no specific cooperation mechanism exists; states that the Commission shall encourage service providers and professional users to develop and implement codes of conduct detailing the information on data porting conditions (including technical and operational requirements) that providers should make available to their professional users in a sufficiently detailed, clear and transparent manner before a contract is concluded. The Commission will review the development and effective implementation of such codes within two years after the start of application of this Regulation; stipulates that each Member State shall designate a single point of contact who shall liaise with the points of contact of other Member States and the Commission regarding the application of this Regulation; provides for procedural conditions applicable to the assistance between competent authorities; states that the Commission shall be assisted by the Free Flow of Data Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011; calls for a review within five years after the start of application of the Regulation and that the Regulation will start to apply six months after the day of its publication. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: a moderate administrative burden for Member States' public authorities will emerge, caused by the allocation of human resources for the cooperation between Member States through the 'single points of contact', and for complying with the notification, review and transparency provisions."

PROPOSED ACT: Joint Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) and the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries signed a strategic partnership at the first bi-regional summit of their heads of state and government in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. Since 1999, successive summits have ensured a steady intensification of political dialogue and progress on jointly tackling a wide range of issues including climate change, migration, the fight against illicit drugs, the promotion of human rights and gender equality, education and cultural issues, and in the fields of science and technology. At the Fifth EU-LAC Summit (Lima, 2008), leaders of both regions decided to consider the creation of a bi-regional foundation to foster debate on common strategies and action to strengthen the partnership and enhance its visibility. The EU-LAC Foundation was formally established in Hamburg in 2011 as a German civil law body, pending the possible conclusion of an international constituent agreement to convert it into an international organisation. Council Decision 2012/493/EU authorised the Commission to open negotiations for an international agreement on the creation of the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation, with the EU, its Member States and the LAC countries as members. Negotiations started in December 2012 and the European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations. The High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met, and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for signature and conclusion. CONTENT: the joint proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union. The aim of the Agreement is to establish the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation with legal personality under public international law. The Foundation can be seen as an instrument of EU common foreign policy because its activities contribute to the convergence of Member States' actions towards the Latin American and Caribbean region, ensuring that the EU is able to assert its interests and values in the framework of the partnership between the two regions. Specific activities of the Foundation contribute to the political dialogue between the EU and CELAC in areas such as global governance and the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The Foundation will also strengthen cooperation between the EU and LAC regions, fostering intercultural exchange, notably by facilitating and promoting participation by, and inputs from, civil society and other social actors. It will aim to: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the conclusion of the Agreement will have no direct budgetary implications, as it will be on a voluntary basis. The Commission has made financial contributions to the Foundation since it was established under German civil law in 2011, most recently (through the Partnership Instrument) the sum of EUR 3 million for the two years from October 2015. Some LAC and EU countries, including Germany as host country, have contributed financially on one or more occasions."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : Directive 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to attain a high level of safety and to remove barriers to trade, by setting harmonised safety standards at an appropriate level for passenger ships and craft operating domestic services. This Directive In the spirit of the Commission's REFIT and Better Regulation agenda and as an immediate follow-up to the fitness check on EU passenger ship safety legislation, the Commission considers that the existing EU passenger ship safety regulatory framework should be simplified and streamlined in order to (i) maintain EU rules where necessary and proportionate; (ii) ensure their correct implementation; and (iii) eliminate potential overlap of obligations and inconsistencies between related pieces of legislation. The fitness check revealed that: the Directive currently applies only to 70 out of 1950 small ships, the key safety aspects of which have been already defined by Member States; several Member States certify aluminium ships under this Directive while few others do not. This creates an uneven situation resulting from a different interpretation of the Directive's scope related to the definition of an 'equivalent material' and the applicability of the corresponding fire safety standards. The proposal is fully consistent with the simplification proposals amending Council Directive 98/41/EC and the proposal replacing Council Directive 1999/35/EC CONTENT: the Commission proposes to clarify and simplify the safety rules and standards for passenger ships so that they are easier to update, monitor and enforce. The main amendments proposed are as follows: to eliminate a number of redundant, inconsistent or incorrect references , in particular related to the Intact Stability Code, High Speed Craft Code, bow height definition, port area (aligned with the definition of a sea area), place of refuge (removed), port State (replacing host State in line with the review of Directive 1999/35/EC), and recognised organisation; to provide for new definitions of traditional ship, sailing ship, pleasure yacht and craft, tender, and equivalent material. In particular, the definition of traditional ship should be better aligned with Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council18, while preserving the current criteria of the year of built and type of material. The definition of pleasure yacht and craft should be further aligned with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS Convention); to clarify the definition of equivalent material to avoid the non-uniform application arising from the interpretation of the Directive's scope related to the definition of aluminium as an equivalent material and the applicability of the corresponding fire safety standards. Ships built from such materials have to be certified according to this Directive; to exclude ships below 24 metres from the scope of the Directive, and to clarify that the Directive does not apply to sailing ships, tenders and ships referred to in the SPS code (including offshore supply vessels); to simplify the definitions of sea areas C and D (references to the criteria of 'where the shipwrecked persons can land' and 'distance to place of refuge' removed), and to clarify that the sea areas is established by Member States in such a manner that the inner border of sea area D is clearly delimited; to update the reference to the host State (replaced by port State), to clarify that the conversion requirement is meant to apply to all ships (when converted in a passenger ships), not only to existing passenger ones and to insert a new date of application for ships built in equivalent material before the entry into force of the Directive; to increase transparency and to facilitate the notification of exemptions, equivalencies and additional safety measures by Member States, by providing for the establishment of a database by the Commission. It should include the notified measures in their draft and adopted form; to clarify that only ships fulfilling the requirements of this Directive are provided with a Passenger ship Safety Certificate; to align Directive 2009/45/EC with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU with regard to the power to adopt delegated and implementing acts conferred on the Commission. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 98/41/EC ‚Äì the first piece of EU legislation dealing with information on persons on board - provides for counting and registration of passengers and crew on board of passenger ships operating to and from the EU ports. It aims to ensure that the safety of passengers is not compromised by exceeding the maximum authorised number of persons on board and that search and rescue in the aftermath of any accident can be dealt with effectively. Since 1998, however, other pieces of EU law and international conventions dealing with related issues have entered into force and new technological systems and solutions have been developed. This has resulted in increasingly complex and overlapping legal provisions dealing with the counting, registration and reporting of persons on board. Experience of implementation has shown that the information on persons on board is not always readily available to the competent authorities. According to the current requirements, this information has to be stored in the company's system and be ‚Äì at all times ‚Äì readily available for transmission to the competent authority responsible for search and rescue. This requirement ignores the development of systems such as SafeSeaNet and the National Single Window and requires that the national competent authority contacts the shipping company in the event of an emergency. Moreover, the recorded data does not always include information on nationality (i.e. besides name, age and sex), making the assistance provided to victims and their relatives more difficult. As a result, operators that already transmit such data to the National Single Window are subjected to a double reporting regime. In the spirit of the Commission's REFIT and Better Regulation agenda and as an immediate follow-up to the fitness check on EU passenger ship safety legislation, the Commission considers that the existing EU passenger ship safety regulatory framework should be simplified and streamlined in order to (i) maintain EU rules where necessary and proportionate; (ii) ensure their correct implementation; and (iii) eliminate potential overlap of obligations and inconsistencies between related pieces of legislation. The proposal is fully consistent with the simplification proposals amending Directive 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and the new Directive replacing Council Directive 1999/35/EC. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 98/41/EC in order to update, clarify and simplify the existing requirements for counting and registration of passengers and crew on board passenger ships while enhancing the level of safety that they provide. The main amendments are as follows: to align as far as possible the definitions with the proposal amending Directive 2009/45/EC and with the proposal for a new Directive replacing 1999/35/EC and to align the responsibility of the passenger registrar with the proposal to remove the requirement for the information required by this Directive to be retained by the company ; to clarify the scope of the Directive and to bring it in line with the definition of port areas as defined in accordance with the proposal amending Directive 2009/45/EC; to replace the requirement to store the information on the number of persons on board in the company by recording it in the National Single Window or transmission by means of Automatic Identification System; to introduce the information on nationality of persons on board and to replace the requirement to store the lists of passengers and crew by the company by recording it in the National Single Window; to align the reference with the proposed means of data transmission and to clarify the responsibilities of Member States with respect to passenger ships flying the flag of a third country; to reflect the new role of the passenger registrar (i.e. not to store but to transmit the data) and to remove the requirement to set up a company passenger registration system; to reflect EU law on protection of personal data and specifies that personal data shall be destroyed by the company once transmitted to the single window (without prejudice to other reporting obligations); to remove the outdated reference to the exemption for regular services crossing the Strait of Messina, and to remove the possibility to exempt operators from transmitting the number of persons on board to the competent authorities; to ensure that the exemption criteria reflect the proximity of search and rescue facilities which are no longer included in the new definition of protected sea areas; to simplify the notification of exemptions via a database to be established and maintained for this purpose; to align Directive 98/41/EC with the provisions of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU with regard to the power to adopt delegated and implementing acts conferred on the Commission.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 1999/35/EC provides for a number of types of inspection addressing particular safety characteristics of ro-ro ferries and high-speed craft (HSC). Notwithstanding the fact that the special inspection regime for these vessels remains necessary, the requirements of this Directive no longer match the realities. Since then, the port State control regime has been strengthened, especially after Directive 2009/16/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council came into force, establishing a risk-based inspection regime and including a minimum number of inspections on high risk ships that Member States must carry out. Today, the vast majority of Member States combine or replace some of the inspections required under Directive 1999/35/EC with either flag State surveys or port State control inspections. This practice renders the implementation and enforcement of this Directive problematic, given the different scope of these inspections and regulatory overlaps. In the spirit of the Commission's REFIT and Better Regulation agenda and as an immediate follow-up to the fitness check on EU passenger ship safety legislation, the Commission considers that the existing EU passenger ship safety regulatory framework should be simplified and streamlined in order to (i) maintain EU rules where necessary and proportionate; (ii) ensure their correct implementation; and (iii) eliminate potential overlap of obligations and inconsistencies between related pieces of legislation. The proposal is fully consistent with the simplification proposals amending Directive 2009/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Directive 98/41/EC CONTENT: the Commission proposes to replace Directive 1999/35/EC in order to update, clarify and simplify the existing survey requirements for roro ferries and HSC while maintaining the same level of safety and key delivery mechanisms. The main points of the proposed new directive are as follows: to limit the scope of the directive to ships providing regular ro-ro ferry and high-speed passenger craft services between ports within a Member State or between a port in a Member State and a port in a third State where the flag of the vessel is the same as that of the Member State in question; to remove a number of redundant definitions and references such as ""passenger"", ""host state"", ""international voyages"", ""exemption certificate"", and to delete the reference to the investigation of marine casualties which is now covered by Directive 2009/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council; to provide for system of ship (rather than company) based inspections prior to the commencement of a regular service. The vessel must undergo an inspection in accordance with Annex II and a number of safety management issues set out in Annex I must also be verified; to stipulate that ships falling within the scope of the Directive are inspected twice per year with a certain time-lag between inspections and that one of these inspections should be an in-service inspection during a regular crossing; to provide that Member State can, if they wish, combine the inspection with a flag State survey which would have to be carried out in respect of a vessel on a yearly basis; to bring into line the provisions relating to the inspection reports, prohibitions of departure, appeals, costs, the inspection database and penalties with those provided in Directive 2009/16/EC; align the directive with the provisions of the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union concerning the exercise of the Commission‚Äôs powers in relation to delegated acts. to amend Directive 2009/16/EC to ensure that the current content and frequency of ro-ro ferries and high-speed passenger craft inspections is maintained; to provide for assessment of the directive by the Commission.

As a first step, the Agreement was signed by the Commission and Council on behalf of the European Union and by all 28 Member States on their behalf at the high-level signature ceremony which took place in New York on 22 April 2016. The Paris Agreement is in conformity with the environmental objectives of the Union as referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty, namely preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; protecting human health; and promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. The 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU sets an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 40% domestically by 2030, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency targets of at least 27%. Implementing the 2030 energy and climate framework is a priority in follow up to the Paris Agreement. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement is a global milestone for enhancing global collective action and accelerating the global transformation to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. It will replace the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, that contains commitments until the end of 2020. These commitments will not be continued beyond 2020. The Paris Agreement sets out a qualitative long-term emissions reduction goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2¬∞C and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5¬∞C. In order to achieve this goal, the parties will prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. Starting from 2023, parties will every 5 years undertake a global stocktake, based on the latest science and implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided. The Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals setting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and accused persons. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings; (ii) a directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. This measure is presented together with a Commission Recommendation on the right to legal aid for suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. By establishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the mutual trust of judicial authorities and can thus help improve mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment in support of its proposal. CONTENT :the draft directive aims to: ¬∑  ensure the effectiveness of the right of access to a lawyer at an early stage in the criminal proceedings for suspects and accused persons deprived of liberty; ¬∑  ensure that requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings have access to legal aid to ensure the right of access to a lawyer in both the executing and issuing Member State (""right of dual defence""). The directive will apply from the deprivation of liberty, i.e. as from the moment one is taken into police custody or similar custody, which also covers periods before formal charge and arrest has taken place. Provisional legal aid : it is in the early phase of the proceedings, especially if deprived of liberty, that suspects or accused persons will be the most vulnerable and most in need of legal aid to be assisted by a lawyer. Therefore, the draft directive makes provisions for provisional legal aid. The proposal states the exercise of the right to provisional legal aid and access to a lawyer must become practicable and effective without undue delay after deprivation of liberty and before any questioning. The right to provisional legal aid should last at least until the competent authority has made the final decision on whether the suspect or accused person is eligible and benefits from legal aid. The right to provisional legal aid also applies to requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings who are deprived of liberty. Legal aid for requested persons : in order to improve mutual trust and make the right to dual defence in European arrest warrant proceedings effective (in both the executing and issuing Member State), the Directive also requires Member States to give access to legal aid, beyond provisional legal aid as the requested persons are not always deprived of liberty. In the period leading up to the final decision on whether the requested person benefits from legal aid in the executing Member State, requested persons that are deprived of liberty are entitled to provisional legal aid in the executing Member State Non-regression clause : the proposal aims to ensure that setting common minimum standards does not have the effect of lowering existing higher standards in certain Member States and the standards in the Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights."

BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Armenia are currently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, of the other part, which entered into force on 1 July 1999 for an initial ten-year period and which has been automatically renewed. On 29 September 2015, the Council adopted Decisions authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the EU and Armenia. The European Parliament has been kept promptly and fully informed throughout the negotiations. The Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, of the other part was signed on 24 November 2017, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Council must adopt a decision concluding the Agreement after approval by the European Parliament. CONTENT: the Joint Proposal of the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy is the legal instrument required for the conclusion of the Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, of the other part. The Agreement aims to strengthen political dialogue by creating an institutional framework and organising cooperation procedures between Armenia and the EU in a wide range of areas. It paves the way for a more effective bilateral relationship with Armenia and is an important step towards increased political and economic involvement of the European Union in the South Caucasus. The Agreement: Although the Agreement is designed to bring Armenian law gradually closer to the EU acquis, it does not go as far as to establish an association between the EU and Armenia."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under Article 21 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, EU citizens have the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, including the right to enter Member States without visas or equivalent formalities. Following the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, the Treaty and Directive 2004/38/EC will cease to apply to United Kingdom nationals who are British citizens, and the right of those citizens to enter Member States without a visa will cease to apply. It is therefore necessary to include the United Kingdom in one of the Annexes to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001. Annex I lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and Annex II lists those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. IMPACT ANALYSIS: No full impact analysis has been carried out. There are only two options: to include United Kingdom nationals who are British citizens in Annex I (visa requirement) of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, or to include them in Annex II (visa exemption) of the Regulation The Commission has concluded that United Kingdom nationals who are British citizens should be exempt from the visa requirement when travelling to the Union for short stays. Given the geographical proximity, the link between economies, the level of trade and the volume of short-term travel by people between the United Kingdom and the Union for business, leisure or other purposes, the possibility of visa-free travel should facilitate tourism and economic activity, which should benefit the Union. As the United Kingdom is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank and is part of the OECD, its profile is that of a country with, in principle, a low risk of irregular migration to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to include the United Kingdom in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (i.e. in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement) as regards British citizens. This would mean that UK citizens would not need a visa to travel for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period in the Schengen area. This regime would apply from 30 March 2019. However, if an agreement is reached, it would apply from the end of the transitional period, as indicated in the withdrawal agreement. The proposal is subject to the condition that the United Kingdom grants reciprocal and non-discriminatory visa-free travel to all EU Member States. The United Kingdom Government has announced its intention not to require EU-27 citizens to be in possession of a visa when travelling to the United Kingdom for short business or tourist stays, from the date on which EU law ceases to apply in the United Kingdom. In the event that the United Kingdom imposes a visa requirement on nationals of at least one Member State, the reciprocity mechanism provided for in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 shall apply."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an integrated gas market is the cornerstone of the Energy Union and a key priority of the European Commission. Directive 2009/73/EC (the Gas Directive) has made a significant contribution towards the creation of the internal market in natural gas. However, it does not explicitly set out a legal framework for gas pipelines to and from third countries. The current practice is to apply the fundamental principles of the gas regulatory framework in relation to third countries, in particular through international agreements on gas pipelines entering the European Union. The Commission therefore considered that legislative action is required in order to define and specify the regulatory framework applicable to all gas pipelines to and from third countries. The EU is to large extent dependent on gas imports from third countries and it is in the best interest of the EU and gas customers to have as much transparency and competitiveness also on pipelines from those countries. The measures envisaged are intended to implement key objectives of the Energy Union, in particular as regards the dimension of energy security. They are part of an ongoing effort to ensure the integration and efficient functioning of the European gas markets. The proposal seeks to implement key objectives of the Energy Union, especially in the dimension of energy security. It is part of an ongoing effort to ensure the integration and effective operation of Europe‚Äôs gas markets. CONTENT: the proposal aims at complementing the Gas Directive (2009/73/EC) to render the rules currently applicable to EU-internal pipelines also applicable to pipelines to and from third countries. Specifically, the proposed amendments are intended to make clear that the key principles of EU energy law (third party access to the network, tariff regulation, ownership unbundling and transparency) will apply to all pipelines to and from third countries up to the border of EU jurisdiction. The proposal will also enable new pipelines to and from third countries to apply for an exemption from the above rules pursuant to Article 36 Gas Directive. As regards existing pipelines, which fall outside the scope of Article 36, Member States will be enabled to grant derogations from the application of the main provisions of the Directive, provided that the derogation would not be detrimental to competition, effective market functioning or the security of supply in the Union. In the absence of an international agreement, an exemption for new infrastructure or derogation for infrastructure already in operation, the pipeline may only be operated in line with the requirements of Directive 2009/73/EC within the borders of EU jurisdiction."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the western Mediterranean is one of the most developed sub-regions in terms of fisheries in the Mediterranean. It accounts for around 31 % of its total landing (EUR 1.35 billion out of a total of EUR 4.76 billion) and around 19 % of the officially reported Mediterranean fishing fleet. Demersal fisheries are highly sought after by fishermen due to their high commercial value. Demersal fisheries in the Mediterranean are highly complex and involve many species of fish and crustaceans. The main demersal species caught in the western Mediterranean are hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp and Norway lobster. The main gear used for demersal species are trawl nets, which have the largest catch and fleet power, but passive gears such as trammel nets, gillnets, traps and longlines are also important. Demersal fisheries in the western Mediterranean are currently managed through national management plans adopted under Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 (the ‚ÄòMedReg‚Äô). Spain, France and Italy have adopted plans in accordance with this Regulation. These plans have proved ineffective in achieving the objectives set by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (""STECF"") has shown that the exploitation of most demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean far exceeds the levels required to reach maximum sustainable yield (MSY): more than 80% assessed stocks are overfished in this sub-region. In addition, the biomass of some of these stocks is close to the limit reference point, indicating that there is a high probability of collapse. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to establish a multiannual plan for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account all the evidence collected and analysed through the impact assessment process, the preferred option is a multi-annual plan at EU level. The reasons for this are as follows: the multi-annual plan would have more positive environmental impacts. In particular, the probability of achieving fishing mortality targets for all stocks would be around 36 %; around 70 % of the assessed stocks would recover to spawning stock biomass (SSB) levels above the precautionary reference point; socio-economic performance is expected to improve across all fleets by 2025; a multi-annual plan would be streamlined (a single regulatory framework), stable (it considers the long-term perspective) and transparent (the three Member States concerned would jointly bring fishing mortalities to sustainable levels). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation aims to address the high levels of overfishing and the ineffective regulatory framework by introducing for the first time a multi-annual plan at EU level. Its aim is to achieve the objectives of the CFP Regulation in western Mediterranean demersal fisheries, namely with regards to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and managed in a way that secure economic, social and employment benefits. The plan will also facilitate implementation of the landing obligation and enable a regionalised approach, whereby the Member States concerned would be involved in the design of management measures. The proposal applies to the stocks driving demersal fisheries (i.e. hake, red mullet, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp, giant red shrimp and Norway lobster), by-catch stocks and other demersal stocks for which sufficient data are not available. It also applies to commercial and recreational fisheries exploiting those stocks in the western Mediterranean. The proposal: lays down quantifiable targets for fishing mortality which should be achieved by 2020 at the latest. The ranges would allow for MSY-based management of the stocks concerned, while providing some flexibility in the context of mixed fisheries; introduces, for each stock, a limit reference point (or biomass limit, BLIM) at which the stock would be in serious danger of collapse and a precautionary reference point (or biomass precautionary, BPA) as a safety margin; introduces safeguard measures to allow a stock to recover in the event of the precautionary or limit reference points being exceeded; introduces a fishing effort regime at EU level for all trawls in the areas and vessels length categories in Annex I; sets a spatio-temporal closure prohibiting trawls from operating within the 100 m isobath from 1 May to 31 July each year. This would reserve the coastal zone for more selective gears in order to protect nursery areas and sensitive habitats, and enhance the social sustainability of small-scale fisheries; introduces regionalisation provisions as required to extend and/or amend exemptions for species with demonstrated high survival rates and de minimis exemptions; establishes regional cooperation among Member States with a view to adopting provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures, including technical measures, for certain stocks; introduces scientific monitoring to assess progress towards maximum sustainable yield for the stocks driving demersal fisheries and, where possible, by-catch stocks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no impact on the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU‚Äôs strategic objective of the Union is to halve the number of road deaths by 2020 compared to 2010 and to move close to zero fatalities by 2050 (Vision Zero). However, progress towards achieving these objectives has stalled in recent years. The number of people killed on the roads has certainly been divided by more than two since 2001. However, in 2017, 25 300 people lost their lives on EU roads and 135 000 were seriously injured. Directive 2008/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on road infrastructure safety management aims to ensure that road safety considerations are at the forefront of all phases of road infrastructure planning, design and operation. However, there are considerable differences in the way in which the Directive is implemented by Member States; many high-performing countries going beyond the requirements of the Directive while others are lagging behind. This proposal forms part of the new EU road safety policy framework 2020-2030. It is part of the third mobility package and complements the process started with the 2016 low emission mobility strategy and the previous ‚ÄòEurope on the move‚Äô packages published in May and November 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the combination of options selected could save over 3 200 lives and avoid more than 20 700 serious injuries in 2020-2030 relative to the baseline (14 650 lives saved and 97 502 serious injuries avoided in 2020-2050). For 2030 alone, road infrastructure measures would result in 562 lives saved and 3 675 serious injuries avoided. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2008/96/EC in order to (i) improve the follow-up on the findings of road infrastructure safety management procedures; (ii) encourage the sharing of knowledge between Member States on these procedures and requirements; (iii) protect vulnerable road users; (iv) improve the deployment of new technologies; and (v) work towards a uniformly high level of road safety in the Member States. Specifically, the amending proposal: extends the scope of the Directive beyond the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) to cover motorways and primary roads outside the network as well as all roads outside urban areas that are built using EU funds in whole or in part; obliges Member States to properly implement and follow-up of all the road infrastructure safety management procedures (RISM Directive); makes it mandatory to apply the procedures of Directive 2008/96/EC to any road infrastructure project outside urban areas which is completed using Union funding should ensure that Union funds are not used to build unsafe roads; introduces a network-wide road assessment, a systematic and proactive risk mapping procedure to assess the ‚Äòin-built‚Äô, or inherent, safety of roads across the EU. This new procedure takes into account historic accident data and the existence of already identified high accident concentration sections; specifies Member States' reporting requirements with regard to the application and results of road infrastructure safety management procedures and requires Member States to rank their road networks according to the level of risk identified in network-wide road assessments; requires joint road safety inspections of the transition areas between the roads covered by this Directive and the road tunnels covered by Directive 2004/54/EC; setting general performance requirements for road markings and road signs to make it easier to roll out cooperative, connected and automated mobility systems; and making it mandatory to systematically take vulnerable road users into account in all road safety management procedures."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: public sector information (PSI), e.g. meteorological data, digital maps, statistics and legal information is a valuable resource for the digital economy. Therefore, the EU has been promoting the re-use of public sector information for several years. Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and the Council on the re-use of public sector information (‚ÄòPSI Directive‚Äô) aims to facilitate the re-use of PSI throughout the Union by harmonising the basic conditions for reuse and removing major barriers to re-use in the internal market. In July 2013 Directive 2003/98/EC was amended by Directive 2013/37/EU, with the aim to encourage Member States to make as much material held by public sector bodies available for re-use as possible. The review was carried out by the Commission concluded that the Directive continues to contribute to the achievement of its main policy objectives, but there are a number of issues that need to be addressed in order to fully exploit the potential of public sector information for the European economy and society. They include: provision of real-time access to dynamic data via adequate technical means; increasing the supply of high-value public data for re-use; preventing the emergence of new forms of exclusive arrangements; limiting the use of exceptions to the principle of charging the marginal cost. The overall objective is to contribute to the strengthening of the EU‚Äôs data-economy by increasing the amount of public sector data available for re-use, ensuring fair competition and easy access to markets based on public sector information, and enhancing cross-border innovation based on data. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: on the basis of the elements presented in the impact assessment, a mixed package of lower intensity regulatory intervention combined with an update of existing soft law was chosen as the preferred option. CONTENT: the proposal for recasting Directive 2003/98/EC aims to: facilitate the creation of Union-wide information products and services based on public sector documents; ensure the effective cross-border use of public sector documents on the one hand by private companies, particularly by small and medium-sized enterprises, for added-value information products and services, and on the other hand by citizens to facilitate the free circulation of information and communication. Scope of the Directive and the general principle : with the recast, the scope of application of the Directive shall be extended to: documents held by public undertakings active in the areas defined in the Directive 2014/25/EU on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and by public undertakings acting as public service operators insofar as they are were produced as part of the provision of services in the general interest; certain research data , a specific category of documents produced as part of scientific research, namely results of the scientific fact-finding process (experiments, surveys and similar) that are at the basis of the scientific process. The general principle that documents falling within the scope of the Directive are re-usable for commercial and non-commercial purposes under the conditions set forth in this Directive (Article 3) is unchanged for documents within the scope of the Directive before the recast. For documents to which the scope of application is extended by the recast, the general principle applies only insofar as the public undertakings in question have made the documents available for re-use. Terms and conditions for making re-use data available : the proposal takes into account the growing importance of dynamic (""real-time"") data and includes the requirement on public sector bodies to make such data available through an Application Programming Interface (API). For a limited number of fundamental high-value datasets (to be adopted through a Delegated Act) there will be a hard obligation to do so. Principles governing charging : the re-use of documents shall be free of charge or limited to the marginal costs incurred for their reproduction, provision and dissemination, and, where applicable, anonymisation of personal data and measures taken to protect commercially confidential information. The re-use of high value datasets shall be free of charge for the user. These datasets shall be available for free, machine-readable and accessible via APIs. Derogations are provided for: (i) public sector bodies that are required to generate revenue to cover a substantial part of their costs relating to the performance of their public tasks; (ii) libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives; (iii) private partners. Research data : the proposal specifies that Member States shall support the availability of research data by adopting national policies and relevant actions aiming at making all publicly funded research data openly available ('open access policies'). It also provides that data already available in ""open access"" research data repositories shall be re-usable for commercial and non-commercial purposes according to the provisions of the Directive. Exclusive arrangements : the proposal specifies that the prohibition of exclusive arrangements shall also extend to such arrangements that do not expressly grant an exclusive right in the re-use of documents, but may lead to a situation where access is limited to one or very few re-users."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during the 2016 ICCAT Annual Meeting held in Vilamoura (Portugal), the contracting parties and cooperating non-contracting parties, entities or fishing entities to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) took a decisive step to address the alarming situation of Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) by adopting a 15-year recovery plan in the ICCAT Recommendation 16-05. The recommendation lays down rules for the conservation, management and control of the Mediterranean stock of swordfish as to achieve a biomass corresponding to a maximum sustainable yield by 2031 with at least 60% probability of achieving that objective. ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 obliges to discard swordfish on board vessels, including in sport and recreational fisheries that exceed the allocated quota of the vessel, and/or the maximum level of permitted by-catches. Mediterranean swordfish caught on board vessels that are below the minimum conservation reference size will also have to be discarded, with the exception of a given by-catch limit established by Member States in their annual fishing plans. The purpose of this proposal is to transpose ICCAT Recommendation 16-05 into EU law to allow the Union to comply with its international obligations and to provide operators with legal certainty regarding rules and obligations. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation lays down general rules for the implementation by the Union of the multiannual recovery plan for Mediterranean swordfish (Xiphias gladius) recommended by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), starting from 2017 and continuing through 2031. The general rules cover management, technical conservation measures, catch control measures and management measures in recreational fisheries. By way of derogation of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the objective of this Regulation is to achieve a biomass of swordfish in the Mediterranean corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield by 2031, with at least 60% probability of achieving that objective. The measures adopted by ICCAT Recommendation 16-05, which are transposed by this Regulation, are more restrictive or more precise that those measures already in force to allow the recovery of the stock. The main differences could be summarized as follows: minimum conservation reference size : the proposal prohibits to target, retain on board, tranship, land, transport, store, sell or display or offer for sale catches and by-catches of swordfish, including in recreational fisheries: (a) measuring less than 100 cm Lower Jaw to Fork Length (LJFL); or (b) weighing less than 11.4 kg of round weight, or 10.2 kg of gilled and gutted weight; maximum number of hooks : the proposal sets the maximum number of hooks that may be set or taken on board vessels targeting Mediterranean swordfish at 2 500; closed seasons : Mediterranean swordfish shall not be caught, either as targeted species or as bycatch, retained on board, transhipped or landed during the period from 1 January to 31 March of each year. In order to protect Mediterranean swordfish, a closure period shall apply to longline vessels targeting Mediterranean albacore (Thunnus alalunga) from the 1 October to 30 November of each year; TAC definition and quota allocation : these have already been transposed in 2017 and are now included in Council Regulation (EU) 2018/120 fixing for 2018 the fishing opportunities for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks applicable in Union waters and, for Union fishing vessels, in certain non-Union waters. Therefore, it is not necessary to include the transposition of the fishing opportunities in this proposal. The recovery plan takes into account the specificities of the different types of gear and fishing techniques. When implementing the recovery plan, the Union and Member States should endeavour to promote coastal fishing activities and the use of fishing gear and techniques which are selective and have a reduced environmental impact, including gear and techniques used in traditional and artisanal fisheries, thereby contributing to a fair standard of living for local economies."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to maintain a high level of maritime safety and pollution prevention at sea, it is essential to improve the level of knowledge and skills of the Union seafarers by developing maritime training and certification in line with the international rules. The training and certification of seafarers is regulated at the international level by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978 ('STCW Convention') which was revised in 2010. Further amendments to the STCW Convention were adopted in 2015 and 2016. Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council incorporates the STCW Convention into the Union law. It also contains a centralised mechanism for the recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by third countries. Directive 2005/45/EC aimed to foster the professional mobility of seafarers within the EU, by facilitating the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by the Member States. An evaluation was carried out and concluded that both Directives are fit for purpose and have met to a great extent the initial objectives and expectations. However, it also identified elements that have hindered the effectiveness and the efficiency of the legislative framework. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Directive 2008/106/EC currently in force and repeals Directive 2005/45/EC. The objective of the proposed revision is to simplify and streamline the current EU regulatory framework for the training and certification of seafarers in order to: to maintain the alignment of EU rules with the international framework : the proposal incorporates the new amendments to the STCW Convention relating to the new qualification and training requirements for seafarers working on board passenger ships and ships falling under the IGF Code and the Polar Code; increase legal clarity regarding the mutual recognition of seafarers‚Äô certificates issued by the Member States by clarifying which certificates are mutually recognised for the purpose of authorising seafarers whose certificates have been issued by another Member State to work on board ships flying the flag of another Member State; modernise the centralised mechanism for the recognition of third countries in order to increase its effectiveness : the proposal provides for an implementing decision on the need to initiate the procedure for recognising new third countries. This new procedural step shall allow the requesting Member State to present the reasons for submitting the recognition request while the Member States will have an opportunity to discuss and decide on the relevant request. The deadline for the adoption of a Commission decision should be extended from 18 to 24 months. Lastly, it is proposed to extend the interval of reassessment of third countries to up to 10 years on the basis of priority criteria."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process (covering medical, social, economic and ethical issues) and an evidence-based process that independently and objectively assesses a new or existing technology and compares it with other health technologies and / or the current standard of care. Following the adoption of the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive (Directive 2011/24/EU), a voluntary European network of HTAs composed of national HTA agencies or bodies was set up (in 2013) to provide strategic and political guidance to the scientific and technical cooperation at Union-level. While Member States have carried out some joint assessments within the framework of the EU co-funded joint actions, the production of output has been inefficient. Use of the results of the joint actions, including their joint clinical assessments, at Member State-level has remained low. The duplication of assessments on the same health technology by HTA authorities and bodies in different Member States within identical or similar timeframes has not been sufficiently addressed. The European Parliament, in its resolution of 2 March 2017 called on the Commission to propose legislation on a European system for health technology assessment and to harmonise transparent health technology assessment criteria in order to assess the added therapeutic value of medicines. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four policy options were analysed. The preferred option is based on Option 4 (permanent cooperation on common tools, procedures, early dialogues and joint clinical assessments), integrating certain elements of Option 2 (project-based cooperation on HTA activities) as well as some adjustments (e.g. transitional arrangements for Member States and progressive implementation of the product scope for joint clinical assessments). CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to provide the basis for permanent and sustainable cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments of new medicines and certain new medical devices. Its general objectives are to ensure a better functioning of the internal market and to contribute to a high level of protection of human health. The specific objectives are to improve the availability of innovative health technologies for EU patients, to ensure an efficient use of resources and to improve the quality of HTA across th EU, and to improve business predictability. Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas: 1) Joint clinical assessments: these focus on the most innovative health technologies with the most Union-wide and public health impact. These assessments are limited to: medicinal products undergoing the central marketing authorisation procedure, new active substances and existing products for which the marketing authorisation is extended to a new therapeutic indication; and certain classes of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices which have been selected by the Coordination Group set up under the Regulation. Following the end of a transitional period, participation in the assessments and use of the joint clinical assessment reports at Member State level will be mandatory. Member States will continue to carry out non-clinical assessments (e.g. economic, organisational, ethical) of health technologies and make decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 2) Joint scientific consultations : these allow a developer in the development phase of a health technology to seek the advice of HTA authorities and bodies on the data and evidence likely to be required as part of a potential future joint clinical assessment. 3) Identification of emerging health technologies : This exercise will act as a key input for the annual work programmes, helping to identify at an early stage of their development, the health technologies expected to have a major impact on patients. The Coordination Group will fully consult with all relevant interest groups during this exercise. 4) Voluntary cooperation in other areas : this cooperation could include the assessment of health technologies other than medicinal products or medical devices, non-clinical assessments or collaborative assessments of medical devices not subject to common clinical assessments. Lastly, the proposal lays down common implementing rules in order to ensure harmonisation of the way in which Member States carry out clinical assessments. A key objective of these rules will be to ensure that clinical assessments, whether at EU or at Member State level, are carried out in an independent and transparent manner, free from conflicts of interests. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the implementation of the proposal has no impact on the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 as the current cooperation on HTA is financed by the Public Health Programme. The financial impact on the EU budget post-2020 will be part of the Commission's proposals for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2) sets out rules on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). RoHS 2 is a recast of the earlier RoHS Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS 1). Both RoHS directives have stimulated a reduction in hazardous materials all over the world. The Commission has a mandate to examine the need to amend the Directive‚Äôs scope in respect of the EEE definition and of additional exclusions of product groups covered by RoHS 2 by virtue of the open scope introduced with the 2011 recast. The Commission has carried out this assessment and identified a number of issues related to the scope of RoHS 2 that need to be addressed to avoid the legislation having unintended effects. In absence of a Commission proposal, the following problems would arise after 22 July 2019: the interdiction of secondary market operations (e.g. reselling, second-hand market) for new-in-scope EEE. This is known as the 'hard-stop'; the stop of the possibility to repair with spare parts a subset of new-in-scope EEE once legally placed on the market before that date; the different (distorting) treatment of cord-connected non-road mobile machinery in comparison to otherwise identical machinery powered by a battery or an engine (currently excluded from RoHS scope); the de-facto prohibition of pipe organs placement on the EU market (as not RoHS-compliant due to the lead used to produce the wanted sound). This proposal treats these four problems which could affect the EU market, manufacturers and citizens and trigger negative economic, environmental, social and cultural impacts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission‚Äôs proposed measures would solve the four identified problems: restoring the secondary market and increasing spare part availability for certain EEE will have the following positive impacts: (i) a reduction of costs and administrative burden both for business, including SMEs, and for public authorities; (ii) positive economic impact in terms of additional market opportunities given to the repair industries and secondary selling; (iii) positive social impact, including for EU hospitals, which would save about EUR 170 million after 2019, due to maintaining the possibility to resell and buy used medical devices; (iv) environmental benefits in terms of reduced overall waste generation; the exclusion of pipe organs from the Directive‚Äôs scope will help avoid the loss of up to 90% of jobs in the sector and the annual loss of up to EUR 65 million by 2025; the exclusion of non-road mobile machinery powered through a traction drive from the Directive‚Äôs scope will support industry development in the sector by removing distortion in the treatment of machinery. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Directive 2011/65/EU (RoHS 2). It tackles scope problems that cannot be resolved by either substance substitution or exemptions and guidance, e.g. for specific product groups with permanent compliance problem or where scope provisions generate market distortions. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Secondary market : after 22 July 2019, both the first placing on the market and secondary market operations (e.g. reselling) of non-compliant EEE will be prohibited. EEE affected by this 'hard-stop' of secondary market operations are medical devices, monitoring and control instruments and other new-in-scope EEE. This barrier to secondary market operations is not consistent with the general harmonisation of EU product legislation. For this reason, the Commission proposes to remove the hardstop of secondary market operations. Spare parts : RoHS 2 creates an exception (to the general substance restriction) for cables and spare parts for the repair, reuse, updating of functionalities or upgrading of capacity of the groups of EEE gradually becoming subject its scope. However, newly-in-scope EEE other than medical devices and monitoring and control instruments are not listed. The Commission therefore proposes to introduce a specific provision to exclude spare parts from substance restriction, so to allow the repair at any time of all EEE in RoHS 2 scope, which were placed on the EU market. Non road mobile machinery : the proposal broadens the definition of non-road mobile machinery to include machinery powered by a cord-connected traction drive, in addition to similar machinery powered by an on-board power source. As a consequence, non-road mobile machinery powered through a traction drive will be excluded from the scope of RoHS 2. Pipe organs : the Commission also proposes to add pipe organs to the list of excluded equipment due to the lack of alternatives for substitution."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council is to ensure exploitation of marine biological resources that provides long-term environmental, economic and social sustainability. The European Union has been a Contracting Party to the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (""the ICCAT Convention"") since 14 November 1997. The ICCAT Convention provides a framework for regional cooperation on the conservation and management of tunas and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and the adjoining seas through the setting up of an International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (the ""ICCAT""). The ICCAT has the authority to adopt binding recommendations for the conservation and management of the fisheries under its purview. These acts are essentially addressed to the ICCAT Contracting Parties, but also contain obligations for private operators (e.g. vessel masters). The ICCAT Recommendations enter into force six months following their adoption and in respect of the EU, they must be enacted into European Union law. CONTENT: the transposition proposal relates to the measures adopted by ICCAT since 2008, with the exception of the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, which is subject to a separate transposition process. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Subject matter and scope : the proposed regulation seeks to lays down management, conservation and control provisions relating to fishing for highly migratory fish species managed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). It shall apply to the Union vessels fishing in the ICCAT Convention area or, in the case of transhipments, in the area outside the ICCAT Convention area for the species caught in the ICCAT Convention area. ICCAT management measures : the proposal states that the ICCAT management measures are divided into 7 chapters per individual species: (i) tropical tunas; (ii) North Atlantic albacore; (iii) swordfish (Atlantic swordfish as well as Mediterranean swordfish); (iv) blue marlin and white marlin; (v) sharks; (vi) sea-birds (caught as by-catch) and (vii) turtles (caught as by-catch). Common control and monitoring measures : the proposal contains measures on: the ICCAT record of large scale vessels which is a list, maintained by the ICCAT Secretariat, of large scale fishing vessels authorised to target ICCAT species in the ICCAT Convention Area; chartering; control of catches, and notably compliance with quotas and minimum size requirements, catch sampling and catch and fishing effort notification; transhipment and on scientific observer programmes respectively; reporting obligations with regard to designated ports and points of contact and with regard to port inspections; enforcement and specifically with alleged infringements and non-compliances and ICCAT draft IUU list (a list of vessels flying the flag of non-Contracting parties, which are considered by ICCAT to have engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Final provisions : measures are proposed as regards the annual report, confidentiality of data, procedure for amendments, exercise of the delegation, implementation and amendments to the existing EU legislation. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 25 September 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an international agreement with ASECNA establishing the conditions for the provision of a satellite-based augmentation service (SBAS) in Africa on the basis of the EGNOS European satellite navigation programme. The Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation was signed on 5 December 2016, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The European Union and Africa have been cooperating on satellite navigation since the 2011-2013 action plan implementing the Africa-EU strategic partnership. The need for cooperation in this field was reaffirmed in the 2014-2017 roadmap adopted at the Africa-EU summit in April 2014. The European satellite navigation programmes form a key part of European Union transport policy, especially air transport. They have been promoted internationally, mainly as a result of cooperation agreements entered into with countries such as the United States of America, China, South Korea and Israel. CONTENT: this proposal for a Council Decision seeks to authorise the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation. The Agreement establishes a framework for the cooperation required for setting up and operating an independent SBAS system, but based on the European EGNOS system, in ASECNA's area of competence. The aims of this Agreement are to develop satellite navigation and to provide associated services in ASECNA‚Äôs area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation by enabling it to benefit from European satellite navigation programmes. The Agreement comprises a technical part and also covers questions of financing and governance. The Union shall assist ASCENA in: The parties shall cooperate on: Financing: the cost of setting up and operating the infrastructure provided for by the Agreement, which belongs to ASECNA, will be financed by ASECNA's budget, by its member states or by contributions, in the form of loans or donations, from countries in the European Union and international financial institutions. In order to set up and operate the SBAS-ASECNA system, the Union will facilitate ASECNA's access to its cooperation and development funds for both current and future programmes. The Agreement provides for the setting up of a joint committee for management and correct implementation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the United States of America was signed in Washington, DC, on 5 December 1997 and entered into force on 14 October 1998. The Agreement provides that the Agreement is concluded for an initial period of five years and may be extended thereafter, with possible amendments, for additional periods of five years, by mutual written agreement between the Parties. The Council successively approved, on three occasions, in 2003, 2008 and 2013, the extension of the Agreement for additional periods of five years. The Agreement is due to expire on 14 October 2018. The assessment carried out by the Commission services demonstrates that the Agreement provides an important framework for facilitating cooperation between the Union and the United States of America in common priority areas for science and technology, leading to mutual benefits. It is therefore in the Union‚Äôs interest to extend the Agreement for a new period of five years. Both Parties have confirmed their intention to extend the Agreement for an additional period of five years without any amendments to the Agreement.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an evaluation of the European Agricultural Statistics System (EASS) concluded that even if the main users of agricultural statistics are quite satisfied with the level of detail and quality of the agricultural statistics, they are not content with the lack of data on specific items (supply balance sheets, land prices and rents, nutrient flows, data related to environment, and others), and that the system is too rigid, not allowing the rapid introduction of new data collections. Three main factors underlying the problems being faced in the area of the EASS : new and emerging data needs such as changes in world agriculture such as globalisation and climate change and consequent changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) not adequately served; data collections not sufficiently harmonised and coherent; burden of providing data perceived as too high. Agricultural statistics used at the Union level are taken from a variety of sources: statistical surveys, administrative data, data from farms and other businesses, as well as farm level data in the form of an agricultural census and samples. The current proposal relates to that last source of agricultural statistics data. This initiative is part of the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT) and is the first step of the Strategy for Agricultural Statistics 2020 and beyond, that aims at streamlining the EASS as a whole and to render the data collection process more efficient and relevant. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a two-step integration of agricultural statistics which would safeguard the continuation and modernisation of structural statistics on agriculture. Two new framework regulations would be introduced stepwise: an integrated farm statistics (IFS) regulation and another framework regulation on statistics on agricultural input and output (SAIO). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to establish a framework for European agricultural statistics at farm level and to provide for integration of the structural information with other information, such as production methods, rural development measures, agro environmental aspects and others. Data collection : for the purpose of obtaining the data referred to in this Regulation, Member States shall carry out statistical surveys. The proposal allows and promotes the use of new forms of data collection and alternative data sources including administrative data and other sources. The core data collection for the survey reference year 2020 shall be carried out as a census. The core data collections for the survey reference years 2023 and 2026 may be carried out as sample surveys. The data must be transmitted within predefined deadlines. Delegated acts and implementing powers : the Regulation proposed to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts to amend the core characteristics listed in Annex III (Core data: Information to be provided), and the detailed topics for the modules listed in Annex IV in order to adapt the data collected to future users‚Äô needs; and to meet specific user requirements in ad-hoc surveys. The Commission should also be empowered to adopt implementing measures on the technical specifications required for the data sets and the quality reporting. Financial support : the draft regulation includes the provisions for financial support to the Member States for: complying with data requirements and developing methodologies aiming at higher quality or lower costs, or both, and the administrative burden of collecting and producing integrated farm statistics; the cost of data collections; the collection of ad-hoc data. Repeal : Regulation (EU) No 1337/2011 shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2022 and Regulation (EC) No 1166/2008 shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has a financial impact for the years 2019 to 2020 (with possible financial impact extended up to 2028 depending on the next MFF). The total appropriations under the current MFF are estimated at EUR 40 million. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 is put forward in the context of the Commission‚Äôs REFIT programme and commitment on better regulation. The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission confirmed their joint commitment to updating and simplifying legislation in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. Repealing such legislation keeps the legislative framework transparent, clear and easy to use. Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 was adopted to ensure that the EU‚Äôs energy policy develops in an effective way and responds to the EU‚Äôs real needs. This Regulation was supported by Commission implementing Regulation (EU) No 1113/2014. Together, these regulations required the Member States to notify the Commission of investment projects for which construction or decommissioning work has started or for which a final investment decision has been taken. Member States have gone through three reporting exercises (2011, 2013 and 2015) since the obligations under this Regulation and its predecessor, Council Regulation No 617/2010, have been in place. In 2016, the Commission carried out the review of Regulation (EU) No 256/2014, including a stakeholder consultation covering all planning and reporting obligations in the energy sector. It concluded that: there were significant overlaps between reporting obligations under Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 and the reporting obligations to the Energy Transmission System Operators ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G; the quality and appropriateness of the information and data received were often poor, and that this information and data had become available to the Commission via other sources. Furthermore, it was noted that the Commission had direct access to market data via its Energy Market Observation System (EMOS). Considering that Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 has therefore not delivered the expected results, the Commission proposes to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union, replacing Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) N¬∫ 736/96."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/20016 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. In the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The new regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes visa requirements and visa exemptions for third-country nationals entering the EU for a short stay. Common lists: the proposal for a regulation lists third countries whose nationals must have a visa to cross the external borders of a Member State (Annex I to the Regulation). It also lists the countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement for stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period (Annex II of the Regulation). Determination of third countries whose nationals are subject to or exempt from the visa requirement is made on the basis of a case-by-case assessment of various criteria, relating inter alia to: illegal immigration, public policy and security; economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade ; the Union's external relations with the relevant third countries, including, in particular, considerations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. This assessment should be periodic and may lead to legislative proposals to amend the lists in Annexes I and II to the Regulation. Exceptions and exemptions : Member States may grant exceptions to the visa requirement as regards certain categories of persons, e.g. holders of diplomatic passports, service or official passports or special passports, civilian air or sea crewmembers or crew and members of emergency or rescue missions. The following persons may be exempted from the visa requirement: a school pupil having the nationality of a third country listed in Annex I who resides in a third country listed in Annex II or in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and who is travelling in the context of a school excursion as a member of a group of school pupils accompanied by a teacher from the school in question; recognised refugees and stateless persons if the third country where they reside and which issued their travel document is one of the third countries listed in Annex II; Reciprocity mechanism : the Regulation provides for a Union mechanism allowing the implementation of the principle of reciprocity if one of the third countries included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement decides to make the nationals of one or more Member States subject to the visa obligation. That mechanism should provide for a Union response as an act of solidarity, if such a third country applies a visa requirement for nationals of at least one Member State. Suspension mechanism : the proposal also provides for a mechanism for the temporary suspension of the exemption from the visa requirement for a third country included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement in an emergency situation, where an urgent response is needed in order to resolve the difficulties faced by at least one Member State, and taking account of the overall impact of the emergency situation on the Union as a whole.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF Borders and Visa) for the period 2014 to 2020, as well as Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management became applicable as of 1 January 2014. The purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The instrument will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors. The aim of the draft Agreement with Liechtenstein (the associated country) is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The draft Decision aims to conclude arrangements between the Union and Liechtenstein on this country's contribution to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-2020 and on the supplementary rules necessary for this participation. This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part. Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision 994/2012/EU established an information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements (IGAs) between Member States and third countries in the field of energy. The main feature of this mechanism is that the Commission carries out compliance checks of IGAs after a Member State and a third country have concluded such agreements. Decision No 994/2012/EU was useful for receiving information on existing intergovernmental agreements and for identifying problems posed by them in terms of their compatibility with Union law. However, it proved ineffective in terms of ensuring compliance of intergovernmental agreements with Union law. The European Council in its conclusions of 19 March 2015 also called for full compliance with EU law of all agreements related to the buying of gas from external suppliers, notably by reinforcing transparency of such agreements and compatibility with EU energy security provisions The review of the current IGA Decision forms part of the deliverables of the Energy Union Strategy adopted in February 2015, which sets the overall context and governance structure for a renewed EU energy policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five policy options have been considered in the Impact Assessment: the option maintained was the one in which the Commission carries out obligatory ex-ante assessments of IGAs. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal and replace Decision No 994/2012/EU and aims to: ensure the compliance of IGAs with EU law to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market and enhance the EU's energy security; and enhance the transparency of IGAs in order to increase the cost effectiveness of the EU's energy supply and solidarity between Member States The IGA Decision thus applies to all energy commodity related supply and infrastructure IGAs, in particular gas, oil and electricity. Only IGAs concerning matters within the purview of the Euratom Treaty are not covered. For these IGAs Article 103 of the Euratom Treaty provides for a specific ex-ante procedure. The scope of the IGA Decision excludes commercial contracts between commercial entities. The revised Decision contains the following elements: Notification obligations with regard to intergovernmental agreements : Member States should: inform the Commission of its intent to enter into negotiations with third country regarding conclusion of new intergovernmental agreements or amending existing ones; notify to Commission a draft intergovernmental agreement or amendment with all accompanying documents as soon as agreement has been reached in the negotiations by the parties. Assessment by the Commission : the Commission should: perform ex-ante assessment of draft intergovernmental agreements or amendments and to inform Member State of possible doubts it may have as to the compatibility with Union law, in particular with internal energy market legislation and Union competition law within six week; inform Member State of its opinion on compatibility of intergovernmental agreement or amendment with Union law within 12 weeks of date of notification. Member States shall not conclude proposed intergovernmental agreement or amendment until Commission informed Member State of any doubts and its opinion. Obligation of Member State to submit to Commission existing and future non-binding instruments with all accompanying documents. The Commission may perform ex-post assessment of submitted non-binding instruments and inform Member State accordingly if it considers measures implementing the non-binding instrument could conflict with Union law. The Commission should share documents it has received with other Member States in accordance with confidentiality provisions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Colombia and Peru, of the other part signed on 26 June 2012, provides for an accession of other Member Countries of the Andean Community to the Agreement. The European Union and Ecuador concluded negotiations for such accession on 17 July 2014. Similarly to the Agreement with Colombia and Peru, the Agreement with Ecuador includes a bilateral safeguard clause and a Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas. Following the decision on signature and provisional application of the Protocol of Accession, it is necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the bilateral safeguard clause and for applying the stabilisation mechanism for bananas as foreseen in the Agreement in respect of Ecuador. CONTENT: this proposal for an amendment is directly derived from the text of the Agreement negotiated with Ecuador. It seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 19/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 20/2013 in order to enable the implementation of the safeguard clause and the banana stabilisation mechanism of the Agreement already concluded with Ecuador. The bilateral safeguard clause provides for the possibility to re-instate the most favoured nation (MFN) customs duty rate when, as a result of a trade liberalisation, imports take place in such increased quantities and under such conditions as to cause (or threaten to cause) serious injury to the Union Industry producing the like or directly competitive product. Preferential customs duties can be also be suspended according to the Stabilisation Mechanism for Bananas when a certain annual import volume is reached, until 31 December 2019. However, the relevant code for bananas was changed from 1 January 2012 from 0803 00 19 to 0803 90 10 in order to reflect the compulsory Harmonised System (HS) amendments. For the sake of clarity, this change should be introduced in both Regulation (EU) No 19/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 20/2013 in the relevant part on the stabilisation mechanism for bananas."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States for the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Georgia is currently listed in Annex I of the Regulation, i.e. among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. The EU-Georgia Visa Liberalisation Dialogue was launched in June 2012. In February 2013, the European Commission presented the Georgian Government with an action plan on visa liberalisation (VLAP). The VLAP is structured around four 'blocks': document security, including biometrics (block I), migration and integrated border management, including asylum (block II), public order and security (block III), and external relations and fundamental rights (block IV). Before the start of the Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the EU and Georgia had concluded in parallel a Visa Facilitation Agreement and a Readmission Agreement, which entered into force on 1 March 2011. Their full and effective implementation has been an underlying condition for the launch and the continuation of the visa dialogue. It is considered that Georgia has met all the benchmarks set out in the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan presented to the Georgian Government and therefore fulfils the relevant criteria for its citizens to be exempted from the visa requirement when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Georgia from Annex I (list of visa-required countries) to Annex II (list of visa-free countries). It shall also be specified that the visa waiver will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: with a view to facilitating trade flows, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 excludes the application of certain provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union while moving between two Union ports or airports without stopping outside the Union. Those provisions are the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, the rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or an aircraft, the rules governing the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to the customs authorities at the point in which they are unloaded or transhipped, and the rules governing temporary storage. As a result, there is no legal basis for requiring the presentation of the goods that are unloaded or transhipped at the point where the goods re-enter the customs territory of the Union after having temporarily left it. Without presentation, it may be more difficult for customs authorities to ensure the supervision of those goods, and there is a risk both, that import duty and other charges are not correctly levied, and that non-fiscal measures such as veterinary and phytosanitary controls are not properly applied. CONTENT: the proposal aims to modify Article 136 UCC in order to ensure the effective application of other UCC provisions, notably those on customs supervision. Under the proposal, the only provisions not applying when non-Union goods re-enter the Union customs territory after having temporarily left it by direct sea or air route, should be: the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration (Articles 127 to 130 UCC) and (2) The rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or aircraft to the customs office of first entry to the Union customs territory (Article 133 UCC). by contrast, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to a certain place, to present them to customs upon unloading or transhipment, to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, and the provisions on temporary storage should apply in these situations, thereby allowing appropriate customs supervision. The situation should be similar for Union goods whose status needs to be proven pursuant to Article 153(2) UCC, to the extent that the customs authorities must be able to check the proof of their Union status. Lastly, the rules governing the obligation to present the goods to customs upon unloading or transhipment and the obligation to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping the goods should not apply to Union goods that have retained their status by virtue of the Regulation having regard to the fact that, even if the goods have temporarily left the Union customs territory, their status has not been altered and does not need to be proven. This amendment should enter into force as soon as possible so as to contribute to effective customs supervision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council introduced a series of measures aimed at enhancing investor protection and rebuilding consumer trust in the financial services industry by increasing transparency in the retail investment market. It requires manufacturers of packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) to produce a Key Information Document (KID). The Regulation empowers the European Supervisory Authorities to prepare regulatory technical standards specifying the elements of the KID. On 6 April 2016, the ESAs jointly submitted the draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the KID for PRIIPs to the Commission. The draft RTS were endorsed by the Commission on 30 June 2016 by adopting the Delegated Regulation on KID. During the scrutiny period, the Council raised no objections to the Commission Delegated Regulation. However, on 14 September 2016, the European Parliament rejected it. The European Parliament called on the Commission to review the provisions relating to multi-option PRIIPs, performance scenarios and comprehension alert. Moreover, the European Parliament and a large majority of Member States asked the Commission to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. Given the exceptional circumstances that have led to delays in the adoption of the Delegated Regulation and in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules, the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 shall be deferred.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations with Kiribati were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters. During further exchanges agreement was reached on all aspects. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 6 May 2015 (Kiribati) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Kiribati when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Kiribati may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Kiribati to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Kiribati remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Kiribati to stay only in those Member States‚Äô European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2006, a High Level Contact Group (""HLCG""), composed of senior officials from the Commission, the Council Presidency and the U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State, was established to explore ways that would enable the EU and the U.S. to work more efficiently together in the exchange of law enforcement information while ensuring that the protection of personal data and privacy are guaranteed. The conclusion reached in the HLCG final report of October 20091 was that an international agreement binding both the EU and the U.S. to apply agreed common data protection principles for transatlantic data transfers in the law enforcement area was the best option. On 3 December 2010, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations on such an agreement between the European Union and the United States of America. On 28 March 2011, the Commission opened negotiations. On 8 September 2015, the Parties initialled the text. The Agreement should now be concluded on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offenses. The Agreement aims to establish a comprehensive framework of data protection principles and safeguards when personal information is transferred for criminal law enforcement purposes between the U.S., on the one hand, and the EU or its Member States on the other. The objective is to ensure a high level of personal data protection when transferred between the U.S., on the one hand, and the EU or its Member States on the other, for law enforcement purposes and, thereby, enhance cooperation between the parties. Whilst not being itself the legal basis for any transfer of personal information to the U.S., the Agreement supplements, where necessary, data protection safeguards in existing and future data transfer agreements or national provisions authorising such transfers. 1) Scope and general objectives: the Agreement aims to establish for the first time, a data protection instrument that covers in a comprehensive and consistent manner all data transfers in a given area (i.e. transatlantic data exchanges in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters). Furthermore, the Agreement will substantiate in the transatlantic context the general requirements on international data transfers laid down in the future directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data adopted on 14 April 2016. 2) Data protection principles and safeguards: the Agreement covers important principles governing personal data processing as well as key safeguards and limitations: Purpose and use limitations: processing (which includes transfers) can take place only for explicit and legitimate purposes within the scope of the Umbrella Agreement, i.e. the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences. The Agreement ensures the application of the safeguards to the entire ""life cycle"" of a given data set from the original transfer from the EU to its processing by a U.S. competent authority and vice-versa, as well as its possible further processing by another U.S. authority or, in the case of a data transfer from the U.S. to a competent authority of the EU or (one of) its Member States, its possible further sharing with/processing by another EU or Member State authority. Onward transfer: if a U.S. authority intends to further transfer data it has received from the EU or one of its Member States to a third country/international organisation not bound by the agreement, it will first have to obtain consent from the law enforcement authority in the EU which has originally transferred the data to the United States. This rule equally applies where an authority of the EU or one of its Member States intends to further transfer data it has received from the U.S. to a third country/international organisation. The provisions expressly take into account the special sensitivity of the transfer in bulk of data of unsuspected persons (e.g. PNR data of every passenger taking a flight, independently of any specific suspicion). The Agreement requires that any further transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, may only take place under specific conditions that provide due justification for the onward transfer. In addition, the Parties to the Agreement must take measures to ensure: Special categories of data: the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or other beliefs, trade-union membership or personal information concerning health or sexual life, may only take place when appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with law (e.g. masking the information after effecting the purpose for which the data was processed or requiring supervisory approval to access the information). 3) Individual rights: data subjects will be able, for the first time, to avail themselves of rights of general application for any transatlantic transfer of personal data in the criminal law enforcement sector, these being: 4) Aspects relating to the application of the Agreement and oversight: measures must be put in pace in order to: The Agreement will be of unlimited duration (which is justified by the nature of the Agreement as a framework providing for protections and safeguards, as well as in the light of the possibility of suspending and terminating the Agreement)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 established a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights which became operational on 1 March 2007. The objective of the Agency is to provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union and its Member States, when implementing Union law. In order for the Agency to carry out its tasks properly, a Multiannual Framework is to be adopted by the Council every five years, determining the thematic areas of the Agency's work. The first Multiannual Framework covered the period from 2007-2012. The current Multiannual Framework (2013-2017) expires at the end of 2017. The Agency refers to fundamental rights as defined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The Agency is not a legislative or a standard setting body. Its work is instrumental in providing data, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights issues to support evidence-based policy making across the EU, thereby also contributing to the development of a culture of fundamental rights in the EU. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish the Multiannual Framework for the Agency for Fundamental Rights for the years 2018-2022. Thematic areas: this proposal confirms the relevance for the next five year period of the thematic areas laid down for the Agency for 2013-2017. No theme is withdrawn. The Commission proposes to remove the exclusion of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and adding a reference to police cooperation. In addition, within the theme related to Roma integration, social inclusion aspects would be strengthened. The thematic areas proposed for the Multiannual Framework of the Agency for the years 2018-2022 are therefore the following: Complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies: the Multiannual Framework should include provisions with a view of ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights. The most relevant Union agencies and bodies in relation to this Multiannual Framework are: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any direct implication for the EU budget. The Agency will develop projects within the areas of its Multiannual Framework and within the human and financial resources in the Agency's annual budget as adopted by the budgetary authority. This will be detailed in the Agency's programming documents."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council harmonises national provisions concerning the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products and insurance-based investment products by insurance intermediaries, insurance companies, their employees, and ancillary insurance intermediaries in the Union. IDD entered into force on 23 February 2016 and Member States have until 23 February 2018 to transpose and apply its provisions. On 21 September 2017, the Commission adopted two Delegated Regulations supplementing IDD with regard to product oversight and governance requirements for insurance undertakings and insurance distributors and to information requirements and conduct of business rules applicable to the distribution of insurance-based investment products. In its decisions to raise no objections to the Delegated Regulations [see 2017/2854(DEA) and 2017/2855(DEA) ], the European Parliament asked the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal setting up a date of application on 1 October 2018, rather than 23 February 2018, as the date of application of the transitional measures of the IDD. The European Parliament justified this request by the fact that it was necessary to give more time to the insurance sector (which includes small operators) to better prepare for a correct and effective implementation of the IDD and to implement the technical and organisational changes required to comply with delegated regulations. Sixteen Member States supported Parliament‚Äôs proposal and further requested an extension of the transposition period until at least 1 October 2018 at least. While considering that the sector has already had a lot of time to adapt, the Commission agrees to respond to the request of the European Parliament and the Member States to postpone to 1 October 2018 the date from which Member States will be obliged to apply the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the IDD. CONTENT: the proposed amendment of Directive (EU) 2016/97 provides that by 23 February 2018 at the latest, Member States must adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with that Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act BACKGROUND: on 21 April 2015, the Council authorised the Commission to start negotiations with the United States of America for the conclusion of an Agreement on insurance and reinsurance. The Commission negotiated a Bilateral Agreement with the US on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance in the course of 2016. The conclusion of the Agreement will lead to: It is now necessary to approve this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Bilateral Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on prudential measures regarding insurance and reinsurance. The Agreement sets out the conditions for group supervision in both Parties of their respective insurance and reinsurance groups: Supervisors can exercise group supervision on groups established within the territory of their Party, and can require information to be provided about worldwide activities which risk seriously harming policy-holders in their jurisdiction or threatening financial stability. The Agreement: Full application of every Article of the Agreement, which starts on either the date 60 months following the date of signature of the Agreement, or the date of entry into force of the Agreement, whichever is later. Where entry into force of the Agreement is prior to the date 60 months following signature of the Agreement, certain parts of the Agreement start to apply on earlier dates. Certain parts of the Agreement shall apply provisionally before the entry into force of the Agreement."
