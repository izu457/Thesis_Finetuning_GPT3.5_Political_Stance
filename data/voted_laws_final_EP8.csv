PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Ukraine is a priority partner country within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The European Union and Ukraine negotiated in 2007-2011 an Association Agreement, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), which was signed by both parties on 27 June 2014. The European Union and Ukraine are to establish a free trade area over a transitional period of a maximum of 10 years starting from the entry into force of the Association Agreement. Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine was to apply until Title IV of the Association Agreement enters into force or is applied provisionally. It was intended that this Regulation (would cease to apply on 1 November 2014 at the latest. In light of the unprecedented security, political and economic challenges faced by Ukraine, and in order to support its economy, it was decided to anticipate the implementation of the Schedule of concessions set out in Annex I-A to the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine by means of the autonomous trade preferences provided for under Regulation (EU) No 374/2014. In view of the challenges Ukraine still faces, the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 shall be extended. CONTENT: in order to support the political and economic stability of Ukraine, the European Commission would propose the extension of the application of Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine until 31 December 2015. For the purpose of predictability, the customs duties and access to tariff quotas should following the extension remain the same as for 2014. The autonomous trade preferences provided for by Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 should have full respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law, promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence, as well as countering the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proposal ensures that it is appropriate to introduce the possibility to temporarily suspend the preferences in case of failure to respect the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by Ukraine. BUDGETARYIMPLICATION: the European Union will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to EUR 487 million (gross) annually. However, those figures are estimates, having regard to the political and economic situation of Ukraine and can change."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements concluded on 30 June 2005 under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law makes a valuable contribution to promoting party autonomy in international commercial transactions and increasing the predictability of judicial solutions in such transactions. In particular, the Convention ensures the necessary legal certainty for the parties that their choice of court agreement is respected and that a judgment given by the chosen court is eligible for recognition and enforcement in cross-border situations. Article 29 of the Convention allows Regional Economic Organisations such us the European Union to sign, accept, approve or accede to the Convention. The Convention affects Union secondary legislation on jurisdiction based on choice by the parties and the recognition and enforcement of the resulting judgments, in particular Council Regulation (EC) 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (the Brussels I Regulation) (to be replaced by Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 as of 10 January 2015), it is in the interests of the European Union to approve the Hague Convention so that it enters into force on the same date of the entry into application of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012. Moreover, the Union, should, when approving the Convention, make the declaration allowed under Article 21 excluding from the scope of the Convention insurance contracts in general, subject to defined exceptions in order to preserve the protective jurisdictional rules available to the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary in insurance contracts under Section 3 of Regulation (EC) 44/2001. The exclusion should be limited to whatever is necessary to protect the interests of the weaker parties in insurance contracts. The Convention was signed by the Union on 1 April 2009 on the basis of the Council Decision 2009/397/EC. It is now necessary to approve the Convention on behalf of the EU. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2), in conjunction with point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is requested to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the EU, the 2005 Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements. Having the EU approve the Convention would reduce legal uncertainty for EU companies trading outside the EU by ensuring that choice of court agreements included in their contracts are respected and that judgments issued by the courts designated in such agreements would be eligible for recognition and enforcement in the other Contracting Parties to the Convention. Overall, approval of the Convention by the EU would complement the realisation of the aims underlying the EU rules on the prorogation of jurisdiction, by creating a harmonised set of rules within the EU in respect of third states which will become Contracting Parties to the Convention. The Hague Convention of 30 June 2005 on Choice of Court Agreements: the Convention on Choice of Court Agreements is designed to offer greater legal certainty and predictability for parties involved in business-to-business agreements and international litigation by creating an optional worldwide judicial dispute resolution mechanism alternative to the existing arbitration system. In particular, the objective of the Convention is to promote international trade and investment through enhanced judicial cooperation by introducing uniform rules on jurisdiction based on exclusive choice of court agreements and on the recognition and enforcement of judgments given by the chosen courts in its Contracting Parties. The Convention seeks to achieve a balance between: (i) the need to guarantee to the parties that only the courts chosen by them will hear the case and that the resulting judgment will be recognised and enforced abroad, and (ii) the need to allow States to pursue some aspects of their public policy, related in particular to the protection of weaker parties, protection against serious unfairness in particular situations and guaranteed respect for some grounds of exclusive jurisdiction of States. How the Convention relates to the Brussels I Regulation: the Convention affects the application of the Brussels I Regulation if at least one of the parties is resident in a Contracting State to the Convention. The Convention will prevail over the jurisdiction rules of the Regulation except if both parties are EU residents or come from third states, not Contracting Parties to the Convention. The Convention will give EU business the necessary legal certainty that their choice of court agreements in favour of a court outside the EU are respected in the EU, and that agreements in favour of a court in the EU are respected in third States. It will also ensure that EU businesses can be confident that a judgment given by the chosen court in the EU is eligible for recognition and enforcement in third states, Contracting Parties to the Convention, and vice versa. Declaration on insurance contracts: the Brussels I Regulation (Section 3) provides for special protective jurisdiction in matters of insurance aimed at protecting the weaker party (the policyholder, the insured party or a beneficiary) and the economic interests of the general public of the place where the weaker party is located. The insured party, as plaintiff, therefore has a choice of suing the insurer at several places, including the place where the insured party is domiciled; the insurer, as plaintiff, can sue the insured party in principle only where the latter is domiciled. These protective jurisdiction rules are based on the premise that the insured party is always the weaker party, even if he acts as a commercial operator in B2B relations. There is no change to this presumption in the Brussels I Regulation (recast). For this reason, the possibility of the parties concluding the choice of court agreement has been limited (Article 13 of the Regulation). The Convention on its part applies to insurance matters without limiting party autonomy to conclude choice of court agreements. The only substantive limitation results from Article 2(1)(a) of the Convention which excludes insurance contracts entered into by private persons as consumers. This is partially contrary to the regime established in the Brussels I Regulation insofar as, for instance, the Convention would apply to insurance contracts concluded by SMEs. Once the Convention is approved by the EU, certain insurance contracts which now fall under the Brussels I Regulation, e.g. contracts between an EU policyholder and the EU branch of an insurer with headquarters outside the EU (Article 9(2) of the Regulation) would fall within the scope of the Convention (Article 26(6), in conjunction with Article 4(2) of the Convention). Therefore, if the Convention were to be concluded without excluding insurance contracts, there would be a lack of parallelism with the protective policy established in the Brussels I Regulation which allows the insured party to sue an EU insurer (or a EU branch of third State insurer) in his own place of domicile irrespective of any other jurisdiction available under a choice of court agreement. Other technical provisions have been included for the EU to exclude certain types of insurance matters falling within the scope of the Convention, without laying down additional conditions. The carve-out is as small as is needed to achieve the goal of protecting the interests of weaker parties in insurance contracts as reflected in the protective jurisdiction rules of the Brussels I Regulation."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 established a specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences (ATPs) for Moldova. That scheme gives all products originating in the Republic of Moldova free access to the Union market, except for certain agricultural products listed in Annex I to that Regulation for which limited concessions have been granted either in the form of exemption from customs duties within the limit of tariff quotas or of reduction of customs duties. In the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the EU-Moldova ENP Action Plan, and the Eastern Partnership, Moldova has adopted an ambitious agenda for political association and further economic integration with the Union. The Association Agreement, including the establishment of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) between the Union and Moldova was signed on 27 June 2014 and will apply provisionally from 1 September 2014. The specific scheme of autonomous trade preferences will continue to apply until 31 December 2015. Recently Moldova has experienced and continues to experience difficulties with its fruit and vegetables exports to some of its traditional markets, which threaten its economic recovery and the reform process that is vigorously pursued by the government of Moldova. The agricultural sector represents around 40 per cent of Moldova's economy and the horticultural sector is an important part of it, providing employment to some 250 000 people (i.e. around 10% of the active population). Moreover, horticultural export levels have fallen in recent years. Taking into consideration the current temporary severe difficulties in accessing Moldova's traditional export markets for a number of products, the European Commission proposes to increase temporarily its fully liberalised market access for imports of these products from Moldova, allowing their commercialisation in the Union. CONTENT: in order to support the efforts of Moldova in accordance with the objectives set out in the ENP, the Eastern Partnership and the Association Agreement, the proposed amendment to Council Regulation (EC) No 55/2008 introduces three new duty free tariff quotas for fresh apples, fresh table grapes and fresh plums. As the Autonomous Trade Preference scheme expires at the end of 2015, this amendment provides for a time-limited response to the immediate needs for the key export products adversely affected (i.e. apples, plums and table grapes). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed amendment to the Regulation incurs negligible implications for the EU budget. The total imports from Moldova to the EU in 2013 constituted 0.1% of the total imports to the EU. Whereas about 90% of all imports from Moldova enter the EU duty-free, imports of fresh apples, fresh plums and fresh table grapes under entry price from the Republic of Moldova represented less than 0.01% of the total EU imports from the world of these products. The corresponding loss of tariff revenue should therefore have a limited impact on the EU’s own resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 17 July 2014 the negotiations were concluded with Ecuador for its accession to the Trade Agreement concluded between the EU and Colombia/Peru. As a result of these negotiations, a Protocol of Accession by Ecuador to the Agreement was initialled between the parties. In order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption pending the completion of the procedures for the approval and application of the Protocol of Accession, it is necessary to ensure that customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased and that no new customs duties are applied on products originating in Ecuador. To this end, the proposed Regulation provides for the maintenance of the level of duty rates that were applicable to Ecuador on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to put in place an interim reciprocal arrangement for the establishment of a free-trade area with Ecuador in order to avoid unnecessary trade disruption, following the initialling of the Protocol of Accession. As from 1 January 2015 , customs duties applied on the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession are not increased nor new customs duties applied on products originating in Ecuador. Duration of the application : the Regulation shall apply from 1 January 2015. It shall expire six months after the Protocol of Accession enters into force or, where appropriate, is applied provisionally, or on 31 December 2016, whichever occurs first. Condition for the application : Ecuador should abstain from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effect or new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect for imports originating in the Union, or from increasing existing levels of duties or charges or from introducing any other restrictions from [the date of initialling of the Protocol of Accession]. Ecuador should also: maintain its commitment to core international conventions on human and labour rights, environmental protection and good governance; be subject to benefit from the tariff treatment provided under this Regulation should be conditional on compliance by Ecuador with the relevant rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto. In the event of failure to comply with any of the conditions laid down in this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission to suspend temporarily in whole or in part the tariff treatment provided therein. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal maintains the current market access arrangements and in this sense does not have any additional financial implications for the EU budget. The absence of its application would, however, entail a potential increase in the customs revenue collection. The amount of this customs revenue collection is difficult to predict, but would in any case be relatively small. The duty savings incurred by current market access regime enjoyed by Ecuador and which lapses on 1 January 2015 are in the range of EUR 215 million (based on 2013 trade figures)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the GFCM Agreement provides an appropriate framework for multilateral cooperation to promote the development, conservation, rational management and best utilisation of living marine resources in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea at levels which are considered sustainable and at low risk of collapse. The European Union, as well as Bulgaria, Greece, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, Malta, Romania and Slovenia are contracting parties to the GFCM Agreement. At its Annual Sessions in 2011 and 2012, the GFCM adopted measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral in its area of competence to be implemented in Union law. The GFCM adopted other recommendations laying down: measures for the mitigation of incidental catches of seabirds, sea turtles, monk seals and cetaceans in fishing activities in the GFCM Agreement area to be implemented in Union law; measures aiming to ensure in its area of competence a high level of protection from fishing activities to sharks and rays, and in particular to the shark and ray species listed as endangered or threatened under Annex II of the Protocol concerning Specially Protected Areas and Biological Diversity in the Mediterranean to the Barcelona Convention; measures for fisheries exploiting small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea which should be implemented in Union law. Regulation (EU) No 1343/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down certain provisions for fishing in the GFCM Agreement area. It is proposed to amend this Regulation to include the measures contained in the GFCM recommendations. CONTENT: the proposal contains technical measures for the sustainable exploitation of red coral, the mitigation of incidental captures of seabirds, sea turtles and cetaceans and the conservation of monk seals, sharks and rays in the GFCM Agreement area. Such measures go beyond the protection already ensured to these species at EU level by the Habitats Directive and other Union acts and include specific recording and reporting obligations for both operators and Member States. The proposal also implements in Union law certain measures for fisheries for small pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea. DELEAGTED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council.

It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments.

Main provisions codified : an Agreement between the European Economic Community and Iceland was signed in Brussels on 22 July 1972. Detailed rules are necessary for implementing the safeguard clauses and precautionary measures provided for in the Agreement. The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the Agreement requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to situations referred to in the proposal (notably in the case of export aids that have a direct and immediate effect on trade, imperative grounds of urgency so require).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 260/2009 on the common rules for imports. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. This Regulation applies to imports of products originating in third countries, except for: (a) textile products subject to specific import rules under Regulation (EC) No 517/94; (b) the products originating in certain third countries listed in Council Regulation (EC) No 625/2009. The main elements of the proposed Regulation concern: Union information and consultation procedure : the Commission should be informed by the Member States of any danger created by trends in imports which might call for Union surveillance or the application of safeguard measures. In such instances the Commission should examine the terms and conditions under which imports occur, the trend in imports, the various aspects of the economic and trade situations and, where appropriate, the measures to be applied. Union investigation procedure : an investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure, subject to the reservation that the Commission be allowed in urgent cases to apply provisional measures. The proposal lays down detailed provisions on the opening of investigations, the checks and inspections required, access by exporter countries and interested parties to the information gathered, hearings for the parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views. It also establishes time limits for the initiation of investigations and for determinations as to whether or not measures are appropriate, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. Surveillance measures : where the trend in imports of a product originating in a third country covered by this Regulation threatens to cause injury to Union producers, and where the interests of the Union so require, import of that product may be subject, as appropriate, to retrospective Union surveillance. The decision to impose surveillance shall be taken by the Commission by means of implementing acts. Safeguard measures : it falls on the Commission to adopt the safeguard measures required by the interests of the Union. Those interests should be considered as a whole and should in particular encompass the interests of Union producers, users and consumers. Safeguard measures against a member of the WTO may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such greatly increased quantities and on such terms or conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products. These measures shall take effect immediately. The proposal determines the maximum duration of safeguard measures and specific provisions regarding extension, progressive liberalisation and reviews of such measures. The implementation of this Regulation requires uniform conditions for adopting provisional and definitive safeguard measures, and for the imposition of prior surveillance measures. Those measures should be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that in 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed the importance of codification as it offers certainty as to the law applicable to a given matter at a given time. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency of Union law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1061/2009 establishing common rules for exports. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Regulation establishes the basic principle according to which the exportation of products from the Union to third countries shall be free, that is to say, they shall not be subject to any quantitative restriction, with the exception of those restrictions which are applied in conformity with the provisions of this Regulation. It should apply to all products, whether industrial or agricultural. The main elements of the proposed Regulation concern: Union information and consultation procedure : if, as a result of any unusual developments on the market, a Member State considers that protective measures might be necessary, it shall so notify the Commission, which shall advise the other Member States. For the purpose of assessing the economic and commercial situation as regards a particular product, the Commission may request Member States to supply statistical data on market trends in that product and, to this end. Safeguard measures : in order to prevent a critical situation from arising on account of a shortage of essential products, or to remedy such a situation, and where Union interests call for immediate intervention, the Commission, acting at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, may make the export of a product subject to the production of an export authorisation. The European Parliament, the Council and the Member States shall be notified of the measures taken. Such measures shall take effect immediately. Any protective measures necessitated by the interests of the Union should be adopted with due regard for existing international obligations. For the implementation of this Regulation, the Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safeguards. The implementing measures shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on comitology."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: improving road safety is a prime objective of the Union's transport policy. An important element of that policy is the consistent enforcement of sanctions for road traffic offences committed in the Union which considerably jeopardise road safety. However, due to a lack of appropriate procedures and notwithstanding existing possibilities under Council Decision 2008/615/JHA and Council Decision 2008/616/JHA (the 'Prüm Decisions'), sanctions in the form of financial penalties for certain road traffic offences are often not enforced if those offences are committed with a vehicle, which is registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place. On 19 March 2008, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council facilitating cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety on the basis of Article 71(1)(c) of the Treaty establishing the European Community (now Article 91 of Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFUE')). Directive 2011/82/EU was adopted on 25 October 2011. The European Parliament and the Council chose Article 87(2) TFEU on police cooperation as its legal basis. The Commission fully supported the contents of the adopted Directive but decided to challenge its legal basis before the Court of Justice of the European Union. In its judgement of 6 May 2014, case C-43/12, the Court annulled Directive 2011/82/EU, but maintained its effects until the entry into force of a new Directive on the basis of the transport article of the Treaty within a reasonable period of time. Following the Commission Communication of 20 July 2010 entitled 'Towards a European road safety area: policy orientations on road safety 2011-2020', the Council invited the Commission to examine the possibilities of harmonising traffic rules at Union level where appropriate and adopting further measures on facilitating cross-border enforcement with regard to road traffic offences, in particular those related to serious traffic accidents. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: given that the proposal does not contain any new elements as compared to the annulled Directive, the impact assessment of the initial Commission proposal remains valid. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to ensure a high level of protection for all road users in the Union by facilitating the cross-border exchange of information on road safety related traffic offences and thereby the enforcement of sanctions, where those offences are committed with a vehicle registered in a Member State other than the Member State where the offence took place. Road safety related traffic offences comprise: speeding; failing to stop at a red traffic light; driving under the influence of drink, drugs; failing to wear a safety helmet; illegally using a mobile telephone or any other communication devices while driving. The proposal is almost identical to the text of the annulled Directive. The main objective of that Directive was to put an end to the anonymity of non-resident drivers and to make sure that their road traffic offences would not go unpunished. For this reason the Directive provided the Member States with the mutual access to each other's vehicle registration data via an electronic data exchange network. This would allow them to identify drivers when they commit traffic offences abroad, thus ensuring equal treatment of non-resident and resident drivers. Once the vehicle owner's name and address are known, a letter to the presumed offender may be sent, on the basis of a model established by the Directive. The Member State of offence will have kept their right to decide on the follow up of the traffic offence. The Commission proposes to introduce minor amendments in order to comply with the Court of Justice case: Legal basis : the legal basis for the adoption of measures at EU level in the field of road safety is Article 91(1)(c) TFEU. UK, Ireland and Denmark : in recitals 22 and 23 of the annulled Directive, UK, Ireland and Denmark had, in accordance with Protocols no 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaties, the possibility not to take part in adoption of, be bound by or subject to the application of that Directive. However, where those Protocols do not apply since they only apply to Title V of the TFEU, those recitals should be deleted. Data protection : taking account of the new legal basis, the general rules on data protection provided for in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data should therefore apply. Consequently, the proposal should refer to Directive 95/46/EC, both in general and for the provisions on rectification, erasure, blocking and maximum storage time. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: there are no other budgetary implications than those already mentioned in the annulled Directive. DELEAGTED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Council authorised the European Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union, the renewal of the Agreement between the Government of Senegal and the European Economic Community on fishing off the coast of Senegal, which entered into force on 1 June 1981, and a Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution. At the end of the negotiations, a new draft Agreement and Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 25 April 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the draft Agreement and the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the new Fisheries Partnership Agreement lays down the following: Main objectives of the Agreement: the main aim of the new Agreement is to provide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and Senegal in the field of fisheries. The aim of the Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in Senegalese waters taking into account available scientific assessments, in particular those of the Fishery Committee for the Eastern Central Atlantic (CECAF), and in accordance with the best available scientific advice and the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the EU and Senegal to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Senegalese fishing zones, in the interests of both parties. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution has been set at: based on: This support meets the objectives of the national fisheries policy and in particular the needs of the Republic of Senegal in terms of support for scientific research, for monitoring and fighting against illegal fishing, and for small-scale fishing, including the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems to allow the recovery of juvenile stocks. Duration of the Agreement: the new Agreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of five years from its entry into force, renewable by tacit agreement. The new Protocol covers a period of five years from the date on which it was signed by the parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial statement annexed to the draft Agreement sets out an overall amount of EUR 9.61 million in commitment and payment appropriations from 2014 to 2018 (including administrative expenses for the management of the Agreement)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the regulatory and legislative framework for retail payments in the EU has been developed over the past 12 years, with the advent of the Euro acting as an accelerating factor. One of the key practices hindering the achievement of an integrated market reasons is the widespread use of so-called Multilateral Interchange Fees (MIFs). At present, no legislation regulating interchange fees is in place in the EU. MIFs are collectively agreed inter-bank fees usually between the acquiring payment service providers and the issuing payment service providers belonging to a certain scheme. Such interchange fees paid by acquiring payment service providers form part of the fees they charge to merchants which merchants in turn pass on to consumers. Thus, high Interchange Fees paid by merchants result in higher final prices for goods and services, which are paid by all consumers. There currently is a wide variety of interchange fees applied within national and international payment card schemes, which gives rise to market fragmentation and prevents retailers and consumers from enjoying the benefits of an internal market for goods and services. Market entry for pan-European players remains difficult, as domestic interchange fees in EU Member States vary widely and new entrants would have to offer interchange fees at least comparable to those prevailing in each market they want to enter. The entry barriers interchange fees thus created for online and mobile payment solutions also result in less innovation. Over the last 20 years, the European Commission and national competition authorities have conducted a number of antitrust proceedings addressing anti-competitive practices in the card payment market. The General Court judgment of May 2012 confirmed the Commission's finding in its MasterCard Decision of December 2007 that MIFs restrict competition as they inflate the cost of card acceptance by merchants without leading to benefits for consumers. In its non-legislative resolution of 20 November 2012 on the Green Paper 'Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments”, the Parliament took a firm position in favour of providing clarity on interchange fees to market participants and expressed itself in favour of a gradual approach leading to a ban on interchange fees through regulation. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment considers six scenarios for interchange fees. The assessment concludes that the most beneficial option appears to be a combination of: capping the level of interchange fees for cross-border transactions with consumer debit and credit cards (in the first stage) and, in a second stage, capping the level of interchange fees also for domestic transactions with consumer credit cards and consumer debit cards; a series of measures to enhance effective market functioning including the limitation of the rule allowing merchants to determine the choice of card brand at the point of sale for all cards and card-based transactions based on four party scheme models. CONTENT: the present regulation, combined with the proposed revised Payment Services Directive, proposes to create common rules for interchange fees in the European Union by introducing maximum fee levels for transactions with payment cards that are widely used by consumers and thereby difficult to refuse or surcharge by retailers. The regulation will in addition propose transparency measures to allow retailers and consumers to make better informed choices of payment instruments. Capping interchange fees : the Commission proposes to set caps for interchange fees to payment service providers of 0.2% and 0.3% for the value of the transaction for all consumer debit and credit transactions. These figures have been accepted by Visa, MasterCard and the French domestic card scheme Groupement Cartes Bancaires. During a transition period of two years, maximum levels of interchange fees are imposed for cross-border transactions (where the card holder uses their card in another Member State) or cross-border acquired transactions (where the merchant uses an acquiring PSP in another Member State) only. After a transitional period, the regulation of interchange fees for consumer cards should therefore be extended to cover also domestic interchange fees. Business rules : the proposed Regulation contains measures as regards business rules that will be applicable to all categories of card transactions and card-based payment transactions based on those. As of the entry into force of the regulation, for instance: the application of the 'Honour All Cards Rule' will be limited. No discrimination will be nonetheless allowed on the basis of the issuing bank or the provenance of the card holder and between the cards carrying the same interchange fee level; the application of any rule preventing or limiting merchants from steering customers to more efficient payments instruments ('no steering rules') will be prohibited; acquiring Payment Service Providers will provide at least monthly statements of fees to merchants, in which the fees paid by the merchant over the relevant month concerning each category of cards and each individual brand for when the acquirer provides acquiring services is specified; the application of any rule withholding merchants from disclosing to their customers fees they pay to payment services acquirers will be prohibited. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council.

It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification.

Main provisions codified : the proposal lays down certain procedures for the adoption of detailed rules for the implementation of certain provisions of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Montenegro, of the other part (‘SAA’). It stipulates that fishery products originating in Montenegro may be imported into the Union at a reduced customs duty, within the limits of tariff quotas. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions regulating the management of those tariff quotas. Tariff quotas : the proposal sets out in particular: concessions for fish and fishery products certain tariff reductions. The proposal also lays down conditions as regards the safeguard clauses for agricultural and fishery products provided for in the Agreement as well as a general safeguard clause. The implementation of the bilateral safeguard clauses of the SAA requires uniform conditions for the adoption of safeguard and other measures. Those measures should be adopted in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases relating to exceptional and critical circumstances arising, imperative grounds of urgency so require. The proposal sets out conditions as regards the administrative cooperation to facilitate the management of the Agreement. It should be noted that the future Regulation shall repeal Regulation (EC) No 140/2008."

Those negotiations led to agreements which provide for the opening, under certain conditions, of certain annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. The proposal aims therefore to open annual Community tariff quotas for high-quality beef, and for pigmeat, poultrymeat, wheat and meslin, and brans, sharps and other residues. Management : the Commission: should be empowered to adopt delegated acts in respect of the adoption of amendments to this Regulation, should the volumes and other conditions of quota arrangements be adjusted, in particular as a result of a Council decision concluding an agreement with one or more third countries; should adopt, by means of implementing acts, rules necessary for the administration of the quota arrangements referred to in this Regulation and, as appropriate, provisions: (a) guaranteeing the nature, provenance and origin of the product; (b) relating to the recognition of the document allowing the guarantees referred to in point (a) to be verified; and (c) on the issue of import licences and their period of validity."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), under the provisions of Article XIV of the FAO constitution, was approved by the FAO Conference in 1949 and entered into force in 1952. Amendments to this Agreement were approved in 1963, 1976 and 1997. The European Community acceded to the GFCM on 16 June 1998 through Decision 98/416/EC. Mediterranean and Black Sea EU Member States are also parties to this Agreement. The GFCM is a so-called Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO), with the aim of promoting the development, conservation, rational management and best utilization of living marine resources, as well as the sustainable development of aquaculture in the Mediterranean and Black Sea. An amendment of the GFCM Agreement was launched in 2013 following a performance review finalised in 2011, which concluded that the Agreement should be amended to clarify the objectives and functions of the GFCM, and strengthen its efficiency. The amended Agreement was negotiated with the GFCM Contracting Parties. The Council authorised the Commission to negotiate on behalf of the Union on matters falling within the Union's competence. The negotiations were carried out by Member States and the Commission as per their respective areas of competence in accordance to the terms of the mandate. The Contracting Parties to the GFCM endorsed the ""Amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean"" at the GFCM 38 Annual Session on 19-24 May 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the amended Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission invites the Council to adopt a decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the amended Agreement for the establishment of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. The amended Agreement revises the structure and content of the current one, so as to bring it in line with modern RFMO instruments. Amendment: main changes introduced are as follows: - A clearer explanation of the purpose of the GFCM Agreement: the new Agreement sets a clear overall objective of biological, social, economic and environmental sustainability of living marine resources. It also introduces definitions of the terms that are necessary for the correct interpretation of the Agreement. Better defined functions of the GFCM, which include the promotion of common fishery management through multiannual management plans, the establishment of fisheries restricted areas, and the collection and dissemination of data. In this context, the new Agreement integrates core elements of the Common Fisheries Policy regarding: - Sanctions: the amendment includes provisions for the establishment of measures/sanctions to address non-compliance by Members/non-Members. - Dispute settlements: the establishment of a well-defined dispute settlement mechanism in case disputes arise between Contracting Parties. It should be noted that the text of the amended Agreement will undergo a final legal check by the FAO, which should be finalised in October 2014. The text may therefore undergo changes, which are not expected to be of substance."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in line with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is seeking an increasingly close relationship with Ukraine that goes beyond mere bilateral cooperation, encompassing gradual political association and economic integration. The EU signed a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine in 1998 that outlines the framework of cooperation in all key areas of reform and continues to be the legal basis of relations between the two parties. Relations were further reinforced in November 2009 when the EU-Ukraine Association Agenda was adopted, which was updated in 2011 (endorsed by the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council in June 2013). On 21 March and 27 June 2014, the EU and Ukraine signed an Association Agreement, which will establish a deep political association and economic integration between the EU and Ukraine. The Ukrainian economy is experiencing a deep recession that is the result of long-standing macroeconomic imbalances and structural problems. The eruption of an armed conflict in the East aggravated the situation through sizable losses of productive capacity and reduced confidence which had a heavy toll on the economy. The new government appointed in Ukraine following the political change in February 2014 envisaged the implementation of an ambitious reform Action Plan. These efforts have been seriously complicated, however, by the armed conflict in the East, growing trade restrictions from Russia, and the escalation of a natural gas dispute between the two countries. As a result, the economic recession in Ukraine has become more severe than initially expected by international donors. In the current situation, Ukraine does not have access to international debt markets and is not expected to regain it in the short term. This is why the Ukrainian authorities requested MFA from the EU of EUR 2 billion on 9 September 2014. The European Commission is submitting to the European Parliament and the Council a proposal to grant MFA to Ukraine of maximum EUR 1.8 billion in the form of medium-term loans . CONTENT: the proposal aims to grant MFA to Ukraine of a maximum amount of EUR 1.8 billion, with a view to supporting Ukraine's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. The assistance will contribute to cover Ukraine’s residual external financing needs in 2015-16, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance shall be made available for a period of two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding foreseen by the proposal. Conditions for granting the assistance : the Commission and the Ukrainian authorities would agree on a Memorandum of Understanding setting out the structural reform measures associated with the proposed MFA operation, including aspects of timing and sequencing. These measures will support the authorities’ reform agenda, including relevant elements of the aforementioned forthcoming National Reform Strategy for 2015-17, and the implementation of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, as well as complementing the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral and bilateral donors. A pre-condition for granting the assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms - including a multi-party parliamentary system - and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. Reform strategy : the Commission will seek consensus with the Ukrainian authorities on the expected National Reform Strategy, so as to facilitate smooth implementation also of the conditionality to be agreed in the proposed Memorandum of Understanding. These policy conditions should address some of the fundamental weaknesses accumulated over the years by the Ukrainian economy. Possible areas of conditionality could in principle include: · public finance management; · anti-corruption; · tax administration; · reforms in the energy sector; · financial sector reforms; · and measures to improve the business environment. Aid instalments : t he assistance will be disbursed in three loan instalments : the 1st instalment is expected to take place in the middle of 2015 ; the 2nd instalment could be disbursed in the 4th quarter of 2015 ; the 3 rd and last instalment could be made available towards the end of the 1st quarter of 2016. The disbursements would inter alia be conditional on satisfactory reviews under the IMF programme and the continued drawing by Ukraine on IMF funds. Management of the assistance : the assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. Where the circumstances permit, and if Ukraine so requests, the Commission may: · take the steps necessary to ensure that an early repayment clause is included in the loan terms and conditions and the inclusion of a corresponding clause in the conditions of the borrowing operations; · decide to refinance all or part of its initial borrowings or may restructure the corresponding financial conditions. Implementing powers : implementing powers shall be conferred on the Commission in line with (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and the Council . The fact that the assistance is of a substantial amount and therefore has a potentially significant impact, justifies the use of the examination procedure, in this context. Report : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, examining the progress made in implementing the Union's macro-financial assistance, the economic situation and prospects of Ukraine, as well as progress made in implementing the policy measures, indicating the connection between the economic policy conditions laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding, Ukraine’s on-going economic and fiscal performance and the Commission’s decisions to release the instalments of the Union's macro-financial assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the MFA would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed into the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU from budget line 01 03 06 (“Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund”). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2015 for a total amount of EUR 1,200 million and the third loan disbursement in 2016 for the amount of EUR 600 million, the provisioning will take place in the budgets for 2017 (for EUR 108 million) and 2018 (EUR 54 million)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: Article 19 of Council Regulation No 1311/2013 stipulates that in the event of the adoption after 1 January 2014 of new rules or programmes under shared management for the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Asylum and Migration Fund and the Internal Security Fund, the MFF shall be revised in order to transfer to subsequent years, in excess of the corresponding expenditure ceilings, allocations not used in 2014. The revision concerning the transfer of unused allocation for the year 2014 shall be adopted before 1 May 2015. It thus applies to programmes adopted after 1 January 2014 even when the relevant legal act was adopted by that time. Moreover, ‘rules’ covers not only the basic legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds concerned, but also implementing and delegated acts, to the extent to which they are a prerequisite for preparing or finalising the programmes. Consequently, this provision also applies to funds from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative as the legal basis is the same as for programmes. It also applies to the Fund for European Aid to the most Deprived (FEAD) as its commitments originate from the Structural Funds and are implemented under shared management. Article 19 also covers contributions from the ERDF to the cross-border and sea-basin programmes established under the European Neighbourhood Instrument and the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance as those amounts are part of national allocations defined in Article 91(2) of the ESI Funds’ Common Provisions Regulation (CPR). It should be noted that Article 19 does not impose any constraints as to the profile of the transfer of allocations to subsequent years. Amounts concerned: as a result of such late adoption: This proposal seeks to amend Annex to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 by transferring the commitment appropriations not used in 2014 to subsequent years for sub-heading 1b, heading 2 and heading 3. N.B. the Commission proposes to transfer the bulk of the allocations not used in 2014 to year 2015 in order to keep the pace of investments for growth and jobs, minimise differences of treatment with programmes adopted in 2014 and ensure equal treatment with programmes whose 2014 commitment tranche is carried-over in accordance with Article 13 of the Financial Regulation. An annex sets outs details of the amounts transferred by the Funds concerned and by year of transfer. IMPLICATIONS ON PAYMENTS: concerning the implications on payments in 2015, they will be covered within the voted budget for 2015. The first initial pre-financing that has not been paid in 2014 will have to be paid in 2015 together with the second pre-financing. However, the corresponding unused appropriations in 2014 have been used by transfers to reduce the backlog of unpaid bills from the previous period 2007-2013 and the reverse operation could be done, if need be, in 2015 to cover the pre-financings. The medium and longer term implications on interim payments of the transfer are more difficult to predict. The legislative acts laying down the provisions for implementing the funds contain provisions for the automatic decommitment of appropriations not used within a given deadline, which is of n+3 years for the ESI Funds and of n+2 years for the AMIF and the ISF. This could in principle result in a shift of payments from one year to another without this lowering the overall needs over the 2014-2020 period. On the other hand, the real pace of implementation will not be pre-determined by the transfer. For these reasons, the Commission does not propose to revise the payment ceilings. It will review the situation regularly in the light of implementation and make proposals if appropriate in accordance with the relevant provisions of the MFF Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Convention of the International Maritime Organisation on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel (the 'IMO' and 'the STCW-F Convention' respectively), was adopted on 7 July 1995 at the International Conference convened by the IMO in London at which delegations of 22 attending Member States voted in favour of its adoption. The objective of the STCW-F Convention is to ensure that personnel on board fishing vessels are qualified (as proven by an official certificate) and fit for the job (following medical examination), so that potential threats to safety of life and/or property at sea or to the marine environment are minimised during operations on board sea-going vessels, bearing in mind that fishing at sea is one of the most hazardous professions. Another aim of the Convention is to achieve and maintain a level playing field in the fisheries sector by fostering vocational education. Pursuant to the right of freedom of movement of workers, in matters of professional qualifications, Directive 2005/36/EC sets clear rules on mutual recognition between Member States under the so-called ""general system of recognition"". The Directive applies to EU nationals wishing to pursue a profession in another Member State where this profession is regulated, except where, for a given profession and in accordance of the principle of lex specialis, other specific rules directly related to the recognition of professional qualifications are laid down by a separate piece of legislation under EU law. The STCW-F Convention does not lay down a system of recognition of professional qualifications similar to the one established by Directive 2005/36/EC. On the contrary, the STCW-F Convention does not admit the use of certificates issued by States that are not party to the Convention. However, Member States are under the obligation to comply with EU law, namely to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/36/EC. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice on external competence, the Member States are not allowed to ratify the STCW-F Convention without European Union authorisation as the provisions concerning the recognition of regulated professions pursed by EU nationals on board fishing vessels affect the exercise of the European Union's exclusive competence in this area. As regards those Member States that have already ratified the Convention before the entry into force of the proposed Decision, they are required to deposit with the IMO Secretary-General a statement whereby they acknowledge that EU law shall prevail in case of conflict in relations between Member States. Against this background, it is now appropriate, in the interest of the Common Fisheries Policy, to authorise the Member States to sign and/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43(2), 46, 53(1) and 62 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Commission proposes that the Member States are authorised to sign and/or ratify the international Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watch-keeping for Fishing Vessel Personnel, 1995, of the International Maritime Organisation, adopted on 7 July 1995, for the parts falling under the European Union's competence. The authorisation to the Member States shall be granted on condition that they formulate a reservation when depositing their instrument of ratification to the effect that European Union law shall continue to be applied in their mutual relations. Those Member States that have already ratified the Convention, shall submit a statement to the Secretary-General of IMO whereby they state that Union law relating to recognition of professional qualifications applies in relations between Member States. The proposed Decision will therefore enable and encourage Member States to take all the necessary steps for ratification without further delay.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the central objective of the future Regulation seeking to amend the Common Fisheries Policy is to progressively eliminate discards in all EU fisheries through the introduction of a landing obligation for catches of species subject to catch limits and species covered by minimum sizes in the Mediterranean. The European Parliament in its plenary vote in February 2013 agreed the gradual introduction of the landing obligation with a starting date of 2014 for pelagic fisheries, highly migratory species and salmon in the Baltic and extending to all fisheries in the Union in the following years. Subsequently, political agreement has been reached by the European Parliament and Council on the Basic Regulation with a new start date for implementation of the landing obligation of 1 January 2015. In the framework of the reform, it is the intention of the Commission that a new technical measures framework will be developed as part of the reform which, over time, should facilitate the full implementation of the landing obligation as envisaged. However, this new framework will almost certainly not be in place in time for the first group of fisheries to be covered under the landing obligation. Therefore legislation is required to remove any legal and practical impediments to implementation on a transitional basis while this new framework is being developed. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no specific Impact Assessment has been carried out as the impacts of introducing a landing obligation have already been assessed under the impact assessment supporting the reform of the CFP. High levels of discards are identified as an important driver of the lack of environmental sustainability of the CFP in the impact assessment. CONTENT: the main action of the proposed Regulation is to facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation envisaged under the Common Fisheries Policy reform by removing all existing provisions from EU technical measures and control regulations that run contrary to the landing obligation. On the technical measures regulations several provisions contained in the current regulations contradict the landing obligation and oblige fishermen to discard. These are minimum landing sizes (MLS), catch composition rules and bycatch provisions. In particular, in order to ensure the implementation of the landing obligation Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms should be amended by: requiring all unintended catches of marine organisms subject to the landing obligation caught in excess of catch composition rules should be landed and counted against quotas; replacing minimum landing sizes for marine organisms subject to the landing obligation with minimum conservation reference sizes; requiring all unintended catches of marine organisms caught in excess of bycatch provisions in specific areas, at specific times and for specified gear types to be landed and counted against quotas. In addition, in order to ensure legal certainty, provisions relating to an area closure for the protection of juvenile haddock in ICES division VIb should be amended. With the same purpose, the Commission seeks to amend: Council Regulation (EC) No 2187/2005 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures in the Baltic Sea, the Belts and the Sound; Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 concerning management measures for the sustainable exploitation of fishery resources in the Mediterranean Sea; Council Regulation (EC) No 1098/2007 establishing a multiannual plan for the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks; Council Regulation (EC) No 254/2002 establishing measures to be applicable in 2002 for the recovery of the stocks of cod in the Irish Sea (ICES division VIIa): Council Regulation (EC) No 2347/2002 establishing specific access requirements and associated conditions applicable to fishing for deep-sea stocks. Council Regulation (EC) 1224/2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the common fisheries policy also needs to be aligned with the landing obligation. The modifications required concern changes to: fishing authorisations; recording of data on all catches particularly when below minimum conservation reference sizes; a higher margin of tolerance for catch estimates below 50 kg in logbooks and transhipment declarations; establishment of rules for remote electronic monitoring (REM) for the recording of data for monitoring the landing obligation at sea; separate stowage of catches and control of marketing of catches below minimum conservation reference sizes; establishing the conditions for the use of control observers for monitoring purposes; the definition of the violation of the landing obligation as a serious infringement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: according to the Act of Accession of Croatia, the country is to accede to international agreements signed or concluded by the European Union and its Member States by means of a protocol to those agreements. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Russia, of the other part was signed on 24 June 1994. The Agreement entered into force on 1 December 1997. A Council Decision of 14 September 2012, authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the third countries concerned, in order to conclude the relevant protocols. The negotiations with the Russian Federation were successfully concluded. It is now necessary to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91, 100(2), 207 and 212, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Act of Accession of Croatia. N.B.: the conclusion of the Protocol is subject to a separate procedure as regards matters falling within the competence of the European Atomic Energy Community.

The text of the Protocol is attached to the proposal. A parallel decision is proposed for the signature and provisional application of the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. The European Parliament will be called upon to give its consent to this Protocol. Main provisions: the proposed Protocol incorporates the Republic of Croatia as contracting party to the Agreement and commits the EU to provide for the authentic version of the Agreement in the new official language of the EU. The Protocol contains a clause specifying that the Agreement is amended following the entry into force of the Treaty of Accession of Croatia to the European Union on 1 July 2013.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in light of the persistent high levels of youth unemployment in the Union, a Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) was established to provide support to 7 million young Europeans not in employment, education or training in the most affected regions. The YEI is integrated in the programming of the European Social Fund (ESF). To ensure a quick response to fighting youth unemployment, Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council laying down general provisions on the five European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) and Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the European Social Funds lay down provisions to allow for a quicker mobilisation of the resources allocated to the YEI, including, inter alia, the commitment of all the resources in the first two years of the programming period. Operations under the YEI therefore have to be implemented, in principle, by the end of 2018 and not 2023 as it is the case for other operations supported by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds), including the European Social Fund. The budgetary constraints faced by Member states and the lack of available funding at the initial stage of the programming period have caused significant delays in the implementation of the YEI. In its Work Programme for 2015, the Commission committed to take initiatives to promote integration and employability in the labour market, including measures to support Member States in getting young people into work. Taking into account the urgent need to address youth unemployment, the Commission states that it is necessary to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to operational programmes supported by the YEI in 2015. CONTENT: it is proposed to introduce an additional provision in Regulation (EU) No 1304/2013 on the additional initial pre-financing for operational programmes supported by the YEI. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to increase the initial pre-financing amount paid to operational programmes supported by the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) from 1-1.5% as outlined in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to a maximum of 30% of the envelope which is allocated to it for 2015. To ensure that the additional initial pre-financing amount is used for the immediate implementation of the YEI, the proposal foresees that this amount is reimbursed to the Commission, if the Union contribution from the YEI does not amount to an adequate level in interim payment applications submitted to the Commission 12 months after the entry into force of this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the YEI remains unchanged. The increased need for payment appropriations for the YEI additional initial pre-financing in 2015 will be fully covered by appropriations of the 2015 budget for the YEI specific allocation. Consequently, the proposed modification should not trigger a potential backlog of 2014-2020 unpaid claims."

BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries applies to imports of textile products originating in third countries, with which the European Community has concluded bilateral agreements, signed protocols or made other arrangements. In recent years, the European Union only maintained bilateral agreements on trade in textiles with Russia and Serbia. After Russia's accession to the WTO and the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia, Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 lost its main purpose. Moreover, Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 was used to impose quantitative limits to certain textiles products originating from the People's Republic of China during a limited period and to eventually use the transitional product-specific safeguard mechanism for China. This mechanism expired on 11 December 2013. Therefore, it is necessary to repeal this Regulation. CONTENT: this proposal foresees the repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 in order to promote legal certainty."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: money funds (MMF, money market funds) offer a short-term cash management tool that provides a high degree of liquidity, diversification, stability of value combined with a market-based yield. The majority of MMFs, around 80% of the assets and 60% of the funds, operate under the rules of the Directive 2009/65/EC on Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS). The rest of MMFs should been operating, since July 2013, under the rules of the Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM) Directive 2011/61/EU. Events that occurred during the financial crisis have shed light on several features of MMFs that make them vulnerable when there are difficulties in financial markets and therefore may spread or amplify risks through the financial system. When the prices of the assets in which the MMFs are invested in start to decrease, especially during stressed market situations, the MMF cannot always maintain the promise to redeem immediately and to preserve the principal value of a unit or share issued by the MMF to investors. This situation may trigger massive and sudden redemption requests, potentially causing broader macroeconomic consequences. In order to preserve the integrity and stability of the internal market by promoting more resilient MMFs and limiting contagion channels, it is necessary to lay down rules regarding the operation of MMFs, in particular on the composition of the portfolio of MMFs. Uniform rules across the Union are necessary to ensure smooth operation of the short term funding market for financial institutions, corporate issuers of short term debt and governments. This proposal is in line with the Commission Green Paper (March 2012) on shadow banking. In response to the Green Paper, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on shadow banking in November 2012 where it invites the Commission to submit a proposal with particular focus on the MMF issue. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in order to ensure the liquidity and the stability of MMFs, a total of 16 options were analysed. The impacts including the costs and benefits on the various stakeholders, investors, asset managers, issuers of short term debt, sponsors were analysed. Such analysis concluded in favour of the creation of a more robust framework for MMFs, increased liquidity levels and more stable structure. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to create a regulatory framework for MMFs in view of ensuring an increased protection of investors in MMFs, as well as enhancing financial stability by preventing contagion risk. It also aims to ensure that the liquidity of the fund is adequate to face investor redemption requests and to render the structure of MMFs safe enough to withstand adverse market conditions. The more specific objectives of this initiative: (i) to prevent the risk of contagion to the real economy, (ii) to prevent the risk of contagion to the sponsor and, (iii) to reduce the disadvantages for late redeemers, especially with respect to redemptions in stressed market conditions. The proposal introduces uniform requirements that will deal, amongst others with the scope of eligible assets, with diversification rules, rules related to exposures to credit, interest rate and liquidity risks, as well as rules regarding the authorisation of the funds intending to engage in money market investment. These are essentially prudential product rules that aim to render the European MMFs more secure and efficient, mitigating hereto related systemic risk concerns. The taking up of activities as fund manager is regulated either by the UCITS Directive or by the AIFM Directive. The activities of the managers will continue to be subject to AIFMD and UCITS Directive but the product rules contained under UCITS framework will be supplemented by the product rules contained in this proposed Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 517/946 has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this requirement, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 517/94 on common rules for imports of textile products from certain third countries not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements, or by other specific Community import rules. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also appropriate to introduce certain slight substantive amendments in Articles 4(2) (Chapter I - General Principles), 6(4) (Chapter II - Union information and investigation procedure) and 23 (Chapter IV- Management of Union import restrictions) of that Regulation. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast. The proposal is part of an alignment exercise following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon to ensure that the previous decision making procedures in trade policy were aligned to the new regime of delegated and implementing acts. Currently, the only countries the EU is importing textiles from that are not covered by bilateral agreements, protocols or other arrangements or by other specific EU import rules – including the Generalised Scheme of Preferences and the Everything but Arms arrangement – are Belarus and North Korea. The proposed Regulation: sets annual quantitative limits for the imports of a number of textile products from these two countries, the management and distribution of which is done through a Commission Implementing Regulation, and it allows for the establishment of Union surveillance and safeguard measures; allows for the imposition of surveillance measures on other third countries where textile imports originating in them cause or threaten to cause serious injury to EU production of like or directly competitive products. Given that the textile sector is a sensitive one for the EU, the proposal aims to ensure that the applicable rules are clear and user-friendly for the operators concerned, and that they ensure legal certainty."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: t he European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal notes that international measures exist to promote responsible sourcing of minerals in areas at risk or affected by armed conflict. The two best-known were adopted in 2011 and 2010 respectively: the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Due Diligence Guidance) and Section 1502 of the United States Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which focuses on the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and nine adjoining countries. Whilst the trade of conflict minerals is very well documented in the case of the DRC, other cases abound elsewhere in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Against this background, the Commission and the High Representative have been working to develop a comprehensive EU responsible mineral sourcing framework. This work follows up a 2010 European Parliament resolution calling for the EU to legislate along the lines of US legislation as well as two Communications in 2011 and 2012 that announced the Commission's intention to explore ways of improving supply chain transparency. It should be noted that this legislative proposal is accompanied by a Communication detailing other policy measures that can be deployed to tackle the problem as broadly as possible. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission examined six options. The preferred option comprises the adoption of a Regulation establishing obligations under a 'EU Responsible Importer' certification based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance – voluntary. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to help reduce the financing of armed groups and security forces through mineral proceeds in conflict-affected and high-risk areas by supporting and further promoting responsible sourcing practices of EU companies in relation to tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold originating from such areas. The draft regulation lays down the supply chain due diligence obligations of Union importers who choose to be self-certified as responsible importers of minerals or metals containing or consisting of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, as set out in Annex I. Self-certification as a responsible importer : a ny importer of minerals or metals within the scope of the Regulation may self-certify as responsible importer by declaring to a Member State competent authority that it adheres to the supply chain due diligence obligations set out in the Regulation. The declaration shall contain documentation in which the importer confirms its adherence to the obligations including results of the independent third-party audits carried out. Member State competent authorities shall carry out appropriate ex-post checks in order to ensure that self-certified responsible importers of the minerals or metals within the scope of this Regulation comply with their obligations. OECD Due Diligence Guidance : the Regulation relies on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance to define obligations for EU importers that opt to be self-certified as responsible importers of tin, tantalum and tungsten ores and metals, and gold, on the basis of a self-declaration of compliance. EU importers opting for self-certification are obliged to integrate all elements of the OECD Due Diligence Guidance in their management system by: (i) maintaining a system of controls and transparency over the mineral supply chain, which includes inter alia the country of mineral origin and the smelters/refiners; (ii) identifying and assessing risks in the supply chain against the OECD model supply chain policy; (iii) designing and implementing a strategy to respond to identified risks; (iv) obtaining independent third-party audit assurances of supply chain due diligence; and (v) reporting publicly on supply chain due diligence. Disclosure : the EU self-certified importer is required to disclose annually to the Member State competent authority the identity and geographical location of the smelters/refiners in its supply chain. The importer is also required to provide independent third-party audit assurances and pass them on to Member States' competent authorities and to downstream purchasers, with due regard to business confidentiality and other competitive concerns. On the basis of the information disclosed to the competent authorities, the EU will publish annually, after consultation with the OECD, a list of responsible smelters and refiners that source according to the Regulation. Infringement: in the case of infringement, competent authorities will issue a notice of remedial action to be taken by the EU importer. If such action is inadequate, the authority will then issue a non-recognition notice for the responsible importer certificate for the minerals and metals covered by the draft Regulation. Budgetary implications: the present proposal entails limited financial implications for the Union budget for administrative purposes: EUR 2.72 million for the period 2014-2018."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 25 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down that a reserve intended to provide additional support for the agricultural sector in the case of major crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution has to be established by applying, at the beginning of each year, a reduction to direct payments with the financial discipline mechanism referred to in Article 26 of that Regulation. Article 25 of this regulation determines that the total amount of the reserve for crises in agricultural sector shall be EUR 2 800 million with equal annual instalments of EUR 400 million (at 2011 prices) for the period 2014-2020 and shall be included under Heading 2 of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The calculation of the financial discipline adjustment rate is part of the preparation of the 2016 Draft Budget. The amount of the reserve for crises in the agricultural sector, foreseen to be included in the Commission 2016 Draft Budget, amounts to EUR 441.6 million in current prices. Based on the first estimates of budget appropriations for direct payments and market related expenditure, the net balance available for EAGF expenditure for 2016 is not likely to be exceeded. Article 8(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 lays down that the adjustment rate applied to direct payments determined in accordance with Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is only to apply to direct payments in excess of EUR 2 000 to be granted to farmers in the corresponding calendar year. Furthermore, it provides that as a result of the gradual introduction of direct payments, the adjustment rate is only to apply to Bulgaria and Romania from 1 January 2016 and to Croatia from 1 January 2022. The Commission has to present a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council concerning the adjustment rate no later than 31 March of the calendar year in respect of which that adjustment rate applies. CONTENT: this proposal aims to implement the provisions of Article 26 of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 and Article 8 of Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. It seeks to set the percentage rate of the financial discipline adjustment rate in respect of calendar year 2015. The proposed Regulation lays down the amounts of direct payments under the support schemes listed in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 to be granted to a farmer in excess of EUR 2 000 for an aid application submitted in respect of calendar year 2015 shall be reduced by 1.393041%. The reduction shall not apply in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total reduction resulting from the application of financial discipline amounts to EUR 441.6 million. The percentage of the financial discipline adjustment rate is 1.393041%. The application of this adjustment rate will result in the reduction of the amounts of direct payments for budget lines covering expenditure relating to aid applications submitted by farmers in respect of calendar year 2015 (financial year 2016)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Council agreed, in its conclusions of 9 March 2012, to propose a joint quantified emission reduction commitment of 20% for the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol for the Union. In December 2012, at the Doha Climate Change Conference, the 192 Parties to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted an amendment to the Protocol. This ‘Doha Amendment’ establishes a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020, with legally binding emission reduction commitments for the Parties listed in its Annex B. The agreement on the Doha Amendment came as part of a broader package. Under the Doha Amendment, the European Union, its Member States and Iceland commit to limit their average annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the years 2013 to 2020 to 80 % of their base year emissions (mostly 1990). The Doha Amendment also makes further amendments to the text of the Protocol to be implemented in the second commitment period. these amendments concern: (i) the inclusion of a new gas - nitrogen trifluoride (NF3); (ii) an ‘ambition mechanism’ which provides for a simplified procedure which allows a Party to adjust its commitment by increasing its ambition during a commitment period; (iii) a provision which automatically adjusts a Party’s target to prevent an increase in its emissions for the period 2013 to 2020 beyond its average emissions for the years 2008 to 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 192(1), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision provides the basis for the conclusion of the Doha Amendment by the European Union and sets out the terms of the joint fulfilment of the commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland. It is accompanied by a proposal for a regulation on technical issues related to implementation by the EU and Member States of the second commitment period. The ratification Decision enables the EU, as a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, to ratify the Doha amendment. It also sets out the terms according to which the EU, its Member States and Iceland will fulfil the 20% emissions reduction commitment jointly. The formal entry into force of the Doha Amendment is an important objective for the European Union. The Commission would like Member States to take the necessary steps to complete their domestic ratification processes not later than 16 February 2015. Once they have finalised their own ratification processes, Member States together with the EU, will simultaneously deposit their instruments of acceptance to enable simultaneous entry into force for all of them. This should take place well before the Paris Climate Change Conference at the end of 2015. On the international level, the Doha amendment will enter into force when it has been ratified by three quarters of Parties to the Protocol (144 of the 192 Parties). The European Union is a Party to the Protocol in its own right, as are all Member States and Iceland. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the budget of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force on 16 February 2005 and contains legally binding emission reduction commitments for its first commitment period, from 2008 to 2012, for Parties listed in its Annex B. The Union and the Member States ratified the Protocol on 31 May 2002, and agreed to fulfil its commitments under the first commitment period jointly. Iceland ratified the Protocol on 23 May 2002. At the Doha Climate Conference in December 2012, all Parties to the Protocol agreed on the Doha Amendment which establishes a second commitment period of the Protocol (starting on 1 January 2013 and ending on 31 December 2020). The Doha Amendment amends Annex B of the Protocol, setting out further legally-binding mitigation commitments for Parties listed in that Annex for the second commitment period, and amending and further elaborates provisions on the implementation of Parties’ commitments during the second commitment period. The Union, the Member States and Iceland also issued a joint declaration upon the adoption of the Doha Amendment, expressing their intention to fulfil their commitments in the second commitment period jointly. The declaration was agreed in December 2012. The agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol should now be formally concluded on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Council is called upon to conclude the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the European Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is hereby concluded on behalf of the Union. Purpose of the agreement: the agreement with Iceland sets out the terms governing Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, its Member States and Iceland. It does not establish any obligations for the Union or its Member States. Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment: Iceland's participates in the joint fulfilment on the same basis as that of the Member States. Iceland's emission level, identical to its assigned amount, will relate to Iceland's emissions from gases and sectors covered under the Kyoto Protocol's second commitment period but that are not covered under the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system (Directive 2003/87/EC7). Application of relevant EU legislation to Iceland: as Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the Union and the Member States are subject to a number of monitoring, reporting and verification requirements under the Kyoto Protocol. For Parties that have agreed to fulfil their commitments jointly, some of this information needs to be submitted jointly. As a consequence, the Commission will require information from Iceland to enable the Union to fulfil its reporting commitments. Moreover, Iceland will need to participate in the registry system of the Union and its Member States that are relevant for the fulfilment of obligations under the Kyoto Protocol. This requires Iceland to apply Union legislation that is not applicable to third countries (including the Parties to the European Economic Area), especially in relation to the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions as well as with regard to the operation of a registry and the accounting for transactions related to the implementation of commitments of the Union, its Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol in line with the terms of joint fulfilment and the internationally agreed rules. The agreement contains a list of Union legislation that shall be binding upon Iceland. It also provides for a procedure to amend this list, to ensure that Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment and follows the same rules and responsibilities as that of Member States, in line with internationally agreed requirements. The agreement also provides for the establishment of a Joint Fulfilment Committee, which ensures the effective implementation and operation of the agreement. Duration and termination of the agreement with Iceland: the draft agreement with Iceland is concluded for a limited time period, until all matters related to the implementation of the second commitment period will have been completed. In case of a breach by Iceland, or objection by Iceland to amend the list of legal acts with application in Iceland according to this agreement, Iceland will be individually responsible to account for all of its greenhouse gas emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol, including those under the scope of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions trading system. Ratification: pursuing the rapid entry into force of the Doha Amendment, before the United Nations climate conference in Paris at the end of 2015, which is to adopt a new legally binding instrument for the period after 2020, the Member States and Iceland will seek to ratify both the Doha Amendment and the agreement concerning Iceland's participation in the joint fulfilment of commitments by the Union, the Member States and Iceland in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol not later than February 2015."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis, the level of investment in the EU has dropped by about 15% since its peak in 2007. General uncertainty about the economic situation, high levels of public and private debt in parts of the EU economy and their impact on credit risk limit the room for manoeuvre. However, significant levels of savings and high levels of financial liquidity exist. The President of the European Commission in his Political Guidelines for the Commission 2014-2019 identified the Investment Plan for Europe as a key policy challenge, as did the European Council on 18 December 2014. The Plan is based on three mutually reinforcing strands: 1) the mobilisation of at least EUR 315 billion in additional investment over the next three years, maximising the impact of public resources and unlocking private investment; 2) targeted initiatives to make sure that this extra investment meets the needs of the real economy; 3) measures to provide greater regulatory predictability and to remove barriers to investment, making Europe more attractive and thereby multiplying the impact of the Plan. The European Council also invited the Union legislators to agree on the necessary legal text by June, so that the new investments could be activated as early as mid-2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes comprises the following elements : Creation of a European Fund for Strategic Investments : the Commission shall conclude an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) in order to support investments in the Union and to ensure increased access to financing for companies having up to 3000 employees, with a particular focus on small and medium enterprises, through the supply of risk bearing capacity to the EIB. Participation in the EFSI should be open to third parties, including Member States, national promotional banks or public agencies owned or controlled by Member States, private sector entities and entities outside the Union subject to the consent of existing contributors. Governance of the EFSI : a Steering Board shall determine the strategic orientation, the strategic asset allocation and operating policies and procedures, including the investment policy of projects that EFSI can support and the risk profile of the EFSI; an Investment Committee, consisting of independent professionals, shall be responsible for examining potential operations and approving the support for operations irrespective of the geographic location of the project concerned. European Investment Advisory Hub (EIAH) : building on existing EIB and Commission advisory services, the EIAH shall provide advisory support for investment project identification, preparation and development and act as a single technical advisory hub (including on legal issues) for project financing within the EU. Granting of an EU Guarantee and Establishment of an EU Guarantee Fund : the proposal creates an initial EU guarantee of EUR 16 billion for EIB financing and investment operations. Those operations need to support: development of infrastructure; investment in education, health, research, development, information and communications technology and innovation; expansion of renewable energy and energy efficiency; or infrastructure projects in the environmental, natural resources, urban development and social fields; SMEs and mid cap companies including by providing working capital risk financing. The support can be provided directly from the EIB or through the European Investment Fund. A transparent European investment project pipeline : a stumbling block to greater investment levels within the EU is a lack of knowledge of ongoing and future investment projects within the Union. The proposal also provides for the creation of a European investment project pipeline as a means to ensure that information on potential projects is transparent and available to investors. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the EU guarantee provided for the EFSI amounts to EUR 16 billion. The proposal establishes a guarantee fund which is intended to provide a liquidity cushion for the Union budget against losses incurred by the EFSI in pursuit of its objectives. However, for an initial period, EUR 8bn will be provided only via payments from the budget. From 2016 onwards, these payments from the budget will gradually build up the endowment of the Fund and should reach an accumulated sum of EUR 8bn by 2020 (EUR 1.35 billion in 2015, EUR 2.03 billion in 2016, EUR 2.641 billion in 2017 and EUR 1.979 billion in 2018). However, two actions will create costs for the EIB for which the beneficiaries cannot be charged: The European Investment Advisory Hub will primarily be funded from existing envelopes for EIB technical assistance under existing EU programmes (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020…). However, additional funding of up to a maximum of EUR 20 million per year (EUR 10 million in 2015) may be necessary and will be budgeted in consequence. Any potential costs for the project pipeline will also be covered; The EIB will incur administrative expenses for increasing its financing via the European Investment Fund to small and medium enterprises. This will require the payment of fees in the order of an accumulated total of EUR 105 million, around EUR 48 million of which until 2020. Operational appropriations required by this proposal are to be fully financed within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

The Commission shall inform the Member States where it decides to initiate, conduct or terminate formal international consultations or dispute settlement procedures.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 385/96 of 29 January 1996 on protection against injurious pricing of vessels. Council Regulation (EC) No 385/966 has been substantially amended. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. Furthermore, it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities presupposes the existence of an international fisheries agreement when granting fishing authorisations to third-country vessels within EU waters. The EU has not concluded such an international fisheries agreement with Venezuela. However, access for Venezuelan fishing vessels operating in EU waters off the coast of the French department of Guiana has been provided in the form of a Council Declaration (Decision 2012/19/EU) which, in accordance with the case-law of the International Court of Justice, has legal effects under international law. By its judgement of 26 November 2014 on the joined cases C-103/12 and C-165/12 (European Parliament and the Commission v. Council), the Court of Justice annulled Council Decision 2012/19/EU. It also confirmed that decisions relating to the conclusion of external fisheries agreements fall fully within the scope of Article 43(2) TFEU (in conjunction with the applicable procedure of Article 218 TFEU, i.e. Article 218(6)a(v) for the decisions on the conclusion) and rejected the position that such decisions could fall within the scope of Article 43(3) TFEU. The Court of Justice maintained the effects of the Council Decision until the entry into force, within a reasonable period of time after the date of the judgement, of a new decision to be adopted on an appropriate legal basis. Hence, the present proposal. CONTENT: in order to ensure the continuity of the access following the judgement of the Court, the Commission considers it necessary that the Council re-adopts a Decision on the declaration addressed to Venezuela confirming its readiness to issue fishing authorisations to a limited number of fishing vessels flying the flag of Venezuela on the condition that they comply with the applicable legally binding Union acts. The Declaration provides that in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters, the authorised fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall comply with the provisions of the European Union common fisheries policy concerning the conservation and control measures and other European Union provisions governing fishing activities in that zone. More particularly, authorised fishing vessels flying the flag of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela shall comply with any relevant European Union rules or regulations specifying, inter alia, the fish stocks that may be targeted, the maximum number of authorised fishing vessels and the proportion of catches to be landed into ports in French Guiana."

This Agreement stipulates that it shall be concluded for an initial period of five years and may be renewed by mutual agreement between the Parties after evaluation during the last year of each successive period. By its Decision 2009/501/EC of 19 January 2009, the Council approved the renewal of the Agreement for a further period of five years, until 17 May 2015. Renewal of the Agreement for five more years would be in the interest of both Parties so as to maintain continuity in the scientific and technological relations between India and the European Union. It is now necessary to renew the Agreement. CONTENT: the proposal calls on the Council to renew the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and India for an additional period of five years. The content of the renewed Agreement is identical to the current Agreement. The renewed Agreement takes account of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and replaces the term “European Community” with “European Union”.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes requirements in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights attaching to voting shares in relation to general meetings of companies which have their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State. The financial crisis has revealed that shareholders in many cases supported managers' excessive short-term risk taking. Moreover, there is clear evidence that institutional investors and their asset managers do not sufficiently focus on the real (long-term) performance of companies, but often on share-price movements and the structure of capital market indexes, which leads to suboptimal return for the end beneficiaries of institutional investors and puts short-term pressure on companies. The past years have highlighted certain corporate governance shortcomings in European listed companies. These shortcomings relate to different actors: companies’ and their boards, shareholders (institutional investors and asset managers) and proxy advisors. Five main issues have been identified : insufficient engagement of institutional investors and asset managers; insufficient link between pay and performance of directors; lack of shareholder oversight on related party transactions; inadequate transparency of proxy advisors; difficult and costly exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors. Stakeholders were consulted on two Green Papers (""Corporate governance in financial institution"" and ""The EU corporate governance framework""). Based on these consultations and further analysis, the Commission's Action Plan: European company law and corporate governance - a modern legal framework for more engaged shareholders and sustainable companies provides the Commission’s roadmap in the area, based the two objectives of enhancing transparency and engaging shareholders. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a range of options, including no policy change, have been considered to address each of the presented problems. The preferred option is the following: 1) mandatory transparency of institutional investors and asset managers on their voting and engagement and certain aspects of asset management arrangements; 2) disclosure of the remuneration policy and individual remunerations, combined with a shareholder vote; 3) additional transparency and an independent opinion on more important related party transactions and submission of the most substantial transactions to shareholder approval; 4) binding disclosure requirements on the methodology and conflicts of interests of proxy advisors; 5) creating a framework to allow listed companies to identify their shareholders and requiring intermediaries to rapidly transmit information related to shareholders and to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights. CONTENT: the main objectives of the proposal are as follows: Improving engagement of institutional investors and asset managers : the proposal should increase the transparency of institutional investors and asset managers. They will be required to develop a policy on shareholder engagement, which should contribute to managing actual or potential conflicts of interests with regard to shareholder engagement. They should in principle disclose to the public their engagement policy, how it has been implemented and the results thereof. Where institutional investors or asset managers decide not to develop an engagement policy and/or decide not to disclose the implementation and results thereof, they shall give a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case. Strengthening the link between pay and performance of directors : the proposal aims at creating more transparency on remuneration policy and the actual remuneration awarded to directors and creating a better link between pay and performance of directors by improving shareholder oversight of directors’ remuneration. Shareholders should have the right to approve the remuneration policy and to vote on the remuneration report. All benefits of directors in whatever form will be included in the remuneration policy and report. The proposal does not regulate the level of remuneration and leaves decisions on this to companies and their shareholders. Improving shareholder oversight on related party transactions : the proposal requires listed companies that related party transactions representing more than 5% of the companies’ assets or transactions which can have a significant impact on profits or turnover to submit these transactions to the approval of shareholders and may not unconditionally conclude it without their approval. For smaller related party transactions that represent more than 1% of their assets, listed companies shall publicly announce such transactions at the time of the conclusion of the transaction, and accompany the announcement by a report from an independent third party. In order to target only transactions that could be most disadvantageous for minority shareholders and to keep administrative burden limited Member States should be allowed to exclude transactions entered into between the company and members of its group that are fully owned by the listed company. Enhancing transparency of proxy advisors : the proposal will require proxy advisors to adopt and implement adequate measures to guarantee that their voting recommendations are accurate and reliable, based on a thorough analysis of all the information that is available to them and are not affected by any existing or potential conflict of interest or business relationship. Proxy advisors are required to publicly disclose certain key information related to the preparation of their voting recommendations. Facilitating the exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors : it is estimated that non-national shareholders hold some 44% of the shares in EU listed companies. The proposal requires Member States to ensure that intermediaries offer to listed companies the possibility to have their shareholders identified. Intermediaries should, on the request of such a company communicate without undue delay the name and contact details of the shareholders. The proposal also requires that intermediaries facilitate the exercise of the rights by the shareholder, including the right to participate and vote in general meetings and requires companies to confirm the votes cast in general meetings by or on behalf of shareholders."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the start of the third trading period (2013-2020), the EU ETS was characterised by a large imbalance between supply and demand of allowances, resulting in a surplus of around 2 billion allowances that is expected to grow over the coming years to more than 2.6 billion allowances by 2020. The reason for this imbalance is primarily a mismatch between the auction supply of emission allowances, which is fixed in a very rigid manner, and demand for them, which is flexible and impacted by economic cycles, fossil fuel prices as well as other drivers. Weakened demand usually goes together with decreasing supply. However, in the EU carbon market this is not the case for auction supply in the current regulatory regime. The EU ETS was set up to deliver EU emissions reduction goals in a harmonised and cost- effective manner. While the environmental objective is guaranteed by the cap, the presence of a large surplus reduces the incentives for low-carbon investment and has a negative effect on the cost-efficiency of the system. In short, if not addressed, these imbalances will profoundly affect the ability of the EU ETS to meet the ETS target in future phases in a cost- effective manner. The Commission report on the state of the European carbon market in 2102 identified the need for measures to tackle structural supply-demand imbalances. This imbalance is expected to continue, and would not be sufficiently addressed by adapting the linear trajectory to a more stringent target within this framework. A change in the linear factor only changes gradually the cap. Accordingly, the surplus would also only gradually decline, such that the market would have to continue to operate for more than a decade with a surplus of around 2 billion allowances or more. In order to address this problem and to make the European Emission Trading System more resilient to imbalances, a market stability reserve should be established. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment shows that :(i) the establishment of a market stability reserve could help address the current imbalances; (ii) such a reserve would make the ETS more resilient to any potential future large-scale event that may severely disturb the supply-demand balance; (iii) operating the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation has the advantage of capturing changes in demand. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a market stability reserve for the EU ETS, as part of the 2030 framework for climate and energy policies. This market stability reserve will operate as of phase 4 starting in 2021 to provide market participants with the necessary certainty as regards the auction supply during phase 3 and an appropriate lead-time for the introduction of the reserve. To ensure predictability, the market stability reserve is designed as an objective and rule- based mechanism on the basis of which the auction volumes are adjusted in an ""automatic manner"" under pre-defined conditions Market stability reserve : the market stability reserve functions by triggering adjustments to annual auction volumes in situations where the total number of allowances in circulation is outside a certain predefined range: · adding allowances to the reserve by deducting them from future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary surplus in the EU ETS if the total surplus is higher than 833 million allowances; · releasing allowances from the reserve and adding them to future auction volumes with the aim of mitigating market instability due to a large temporary deficit in the EU ETS provided the total surplus is below 400 million allowances. Allowances are thus placed in and released from the market stability reserve in relation to the total number of allowances in circulation. To ensure predictability and more gradual changes to the market stability reserve, a pre- defined volume of 100 million allowances per year would be released from the reserve where the conditions are met. This quantity represents roughly 5% of the current annual emissions in the EU ETS which based on historical experience should be sufficient to cater for even very sudden and strong increases in demand. The proposal also contains provisions aimed at smoothening auctioning supply in the years around transitions between trading phases in cases where the default would otherwise have resulted in sharp changes. If the volume of allowances that should be auctioned in the last year of the period exceeds the average amount to be auctioned in the two following years by more than 30%, this difference will be evenly distributed over these years. This provision builds on the experience gained in the transition from phase 2 to phase 3 of the EU ETS."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU labour law directives are generally applicable to all sectors of activity and all categories of workers. Nevertheless, seafarers are excluded or can be excluded from the scope of six directives, without any express justification. The directives concerned are the following: Directive 2008/94/EC relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer (hereafter referred to as ‘the Employer Insolvency Directive’); Directive 2009/38/EC on the establishment of European Works Council (hereafter referred to as the ‘European Works Council Directive’); Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees (hereafter referred to as the ‘Information and Consultation Directive’); Directive 98/59/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies (hereafter referred to as the ‘Collective Redundancies Directive’); Directive 2001/23/EC relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings (hereafter referred to as the ‘Transfer of Undertakings Directive’); Directive 96/71/EC concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services (hereafter referred to as the ‘Posting of Workers Directive’). Depending on the situation at national level, exclusions could have a negative impact on a number of rights recognised under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular the right to information and consultation within the undertaking and the right to fair and just working conditions. Most of the Member States have made little or no use of the exclusions which gives rise to a potential situation whereby the same categories of workers are treated differently in the different Member States. The number of EU national seafarers is steadily decreasing and this could be problematic for the future, notably because experience off-shore is essential for certain shore-based jobs. Although this could be the consequence of different factors, the lack of interest in maritime careers may be reinforced by the impression that seafarers are less well protected than other employees. As a consequence, the aim of the proposal is to improve the level of protection of the rights protected under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in EU labour law and to ensure a level playing field at EU level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the Directive to be amended, different options have been identified: suppression of the exclusions for the Insolvency Directive and for the European Works Council Directive; granting a derogation concerning the equivalent level of protection for the Information and Consultation Directive; including specific provisions for the Collective Redundancies Directive and for the Transfer of Undertakings Directive; As regards the Posting of Workers Directive, it was decided that no changes should be made. LEGAL BASIS: This proposal introduces amendments to five existing Directives: Directives 2008/94/EC, 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC, 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC. Three of these Directives were adopted with Article 153 TFEU (former Article 137 EC) as legal basis: 2009/38/EC, 2002/14/EC and 2008/94/EC. The legal bases of Directives 98/59/EC and 2001/23/EC were respectively Articles 100 EC and 94 EC, i.e., equivalent to the current Article 115 TFEU. Despite the different legal bases of the Directives to be amended, having regard to their content, it is clear that they all serve to support and complement Member States' activities in the fields enumerated in Article 153(1) TFEU, in order to further the social policy objectives of the Union. Article 153(2) TFEU is therefore the adequate legal basis for a single proposal amending the abovementioned five Directives. CONTENT: this proposal introduces amendments to five Directives in force. The amending provisions may be summarised as follows : Right to information and consultation : the proposal recognises an unconditional right to information and consultation of seagoing workers in all Directives which previously allowed for exceptions and derogations from this right (European Works Councils Directive, Information and Consultation Directive, Collective Redundancies Directive, Transfer of Undertakings Directive). Principles : the proposal also recognises other rights, taking into account the specificity of the sector (suppression in some specific cases of cooling-off periods in the Collective Redundancies Directive or of the transfer of the employment contract/relationship in the Transfer of Undertakings Directive). Amendments to the Directives : a) reintroduction of seafarers into the scope of certain Directives : the deletion of Article 1(3), point (b) of Directive 2008/94/EC. This will suppress the possibility of excluding share-fishermen from the scope of the Insolvency Directive; suppression of Article 1(7) of Directive 2009/38/EC. Merchant navy crews will therefore be covered by the provisions of the European Works Council Directive. b) new rights : modifications to Article 3(3) of Directive 2002/14/EC in order to clarify that Member States are able to derogate from the general provisions of the Directive only where an equivalent level of protection and effective exercise by the employees concerned is ensured. c) collective redundancies : Directive 98/59/EC is amended as follows: insertion of the definition of ‘transfer’, by reference to Directive 2001/23/EC; deletion of Article 1(2)(c), thus putting the crews of seagoing vessels within the scope of the Collective Redundancies Directive; clarification that the notification provided for by Article 3(1) of the Directive should always be made to the competent authority of the State of the flag. This clarification is necessary because of the potential coexistence of employment contracts under different national laws; insertion of a new provision stating that Member States may grant the competent public authority the right to derogate, in part of in full, from the provisions on the ‘cooling-off’ period when the envisaged collective redundancy is carried out as a consequence of a transfer, having as its object exclusively one vessel or more vessels, or when the employer only operates one vessel. If Member States would like to make use of this derogation, they have to consult social partners when transposing this provision into their legislation. This amendment takes into account the characteristics of the maritime sector. It should be underlined that in the case of a sale consisting exclusively of one vessel or more, or in the case of an employer operating one vessel, the information and consultation obligation laid down in Article 2 continues to apply. The Directive remains fully applicable in all other circumstances where the collective dismissal of members of the crew of a vessel is envisaged. d) transfer of undertakings : current Article 1(3) of Directive 2001/23/EC is repealed. The Directive is made fully applicable to seagoing vessels registered in and/or flying the flag of a Member State, wherever they are situated. However, taking into account the specific characteristics of the maritime sector, Member States may, after consultation of social partners, derogate from the provisions of Chapter II of the Directive in the case of transfers concerning exclusively one seagoing vessel or a number of seagoing vessels, or the undertaking or business being transferred only operates one seagoing vessel. Consequently, in case of transfers concerning vessels exclusively or in the case of the undertaking only operating one vessel, at least the provisions of the Directive concerning information and consultation shall apply. Vessels are fully covered by the scope of the Directive when they constitute one of the assets being transferred. Non-regression clause : this clause aims at safeguarding the rights of workers covered by the scope of the proposal as recognised by the Member States before its entry into force. Review clause : the objective of the review is to monitor the implementation and application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Directive in the Member States, in particular on two issues: the phenomenon of flagging out, the level of employment of EU seafarers. Transition period : in order to take into account the differences between Member States regarding the nature of the maritime sector and the extent to which seafarers are included in the scope of national labour legislation, the proposal provides for a transition period of 5 years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No 29) of the ILO is one of the ILO’s eight fundamental Conventions that make up the core international labour standards, and it is considered a human rights instrument. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO estimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced labour. In 2014, the International Labour Conference adopted the Protocol on the forced labour convention seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress on preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and compensating victims of forced labour. The European Union (EU) is committed to promoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human beings, both internally and in its external relations. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related Protocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the EU’s policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and improving working conditions worldwide. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to authorise the Member States to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation. The Protocol is a binding international agreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates legal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by States that have ratified the Convention. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), and more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention, Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol outside the framework of the EU’s institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall into areas of EU competence. However, the EU as such cannot ratify an ILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such Protocols. The Protocol’s provisions strengthen the international legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced labour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as compensation. The Protocol sets out the measures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely: The Protocol addresses areas of EU law that are already subject to an advanced degree of regulation: (i) certain aspects covered by EU social policy, in respect of which EU law sets minimum rules on working conditions; (ii) certain aspects relating to the freedom of movement for workers. The Commission proposes that the Decision should be based on the one hand on Article 153(2) TFEU, second subparagraph TFEU, in conjunction with Article 218(6) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on protecting and improving working conditions, relevant to preventing forced labour. The provisions of the draft Protocol other than the provisions related to social policy will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision. The Decision recommends that Member States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 introduced a general ban on placing seal products on the Union's market (Basic Regulation). Those measures were adopted in response to public moral concerns about the animal welfare aspects of the killing of seals. At the same time, seal hunting is an integral part of the culture and identity of the Inuit and other indigenous communities and makes a major contribution to their subsistence. It is for this reason that the Basic Regulation contains: an exception from the general ban for seal products derived from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities that contribute to their subsistence (""the IC exception""); exceptions for the import of seal products derived from seals hunted for the sole purpose of the sustainable management of marine resources on a not-for profit basis and not for commercial reasons (""the MRM exception"") as well as for imports of an occasional nature and which consist exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. An implementing Regulation, Commission Regulation (EU) No 737/2010 lays down detailed rules for the implementation of the Basic Regulation. Both acts were challenged by Canada and Norway in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In June 2014, the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) adopted the reports disapproving the IC and MRM exceptions. · The MRM exception was found not to be justified as the possible difference in the commercial dimension of commercial hunts and MRM hunts (small scale, non-profit) was not sufficient to justify the distinction. · With regard to the IC exception, while in principle reflecting a legitimate distinction, the Appellate body ruled, that some elements of its design and application amounted to “arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination”. The purpose of this proposal is to implement the DSB recommendations and rulings with regard to the Basic Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products states that the placing on the market of seal products shall be allowed only where the seal products result from hunts conducted by Inuit and other indigenous communities, provided that the following conditions are all satisfied: the hunt has been traditionally conducted by the community; the hunt contributes to the subsistence of the community and is not conducted primarily for commercial reasons; the hunt is conducted in a manner which reduces pain, distress, fear or other forms of suffering of the animals hunted to the extent possible taking into consideration the traditional way of life and the subsistence needs of the community. As regards the import of seal products , this shall also be allowed where it is of an occasional nature and consists exclusively of goods for the personal use of travellers or their families. The nature and quantity of such goods shall not be such as to indicate that they are being imported for commercial reasons. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 98/58/EC on the protection of animals kept for farming purposes sets very general minimum animal welfare standards for animals used in agriculture. It does not refer explicitly to cloning, but calls on Member States to avoid unnecessary pain, suffering or injury in farm animals. If cloning causes unnecessary pain, suffering or injury Member States have to act at national level to avoid it. In 2008, the Commission presented a proposal to streamline the approval process in Regulation (EC) N° 258/97 on novel foods. In the legislative procedure, lawmakers aimed to amend the proposal to introduce specific rules on cloning. Yet no agreement was reached on the scope and features of these insertions so that the proposal was abandoned after a failed Conciliation in March 2011. As a result, the Commission was asked to prepare a legislative proposal on cloning in food production based on an impact assessment outside the Novel Food Regulation. The European Parliament resolution of 6 July 2011 on the Commission Work Programme 2012 requested a legislative proposal to prohibit food from clones, offspring and descendants. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) views cloning primarily as an animal welfare hazard related to the low efficiency of the technique. It up-dated its opinion on cloning of animals in 2012 concluding that scientific knowledge available on cloning has increased but that nevertheless its efficiency remains low compared to other reproduction techniques. Union citizens , on the other hand, held a broadly negative perception of the use of the cloning technique for the production of animals for farming purposes. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option calling for a temporary suspension of the technique and of imports of live clones was retained as the basis of the present proposal. CONTENT: the proposal envisages a suspension on Union territory of: the use of the technique for food production purposes; the marketing of live clones (animal clones). These provisional prohibitions will confine a production technique causing distress to animals to areas where it appears to have particular benefit. The provisional prohibitions are kept under review given the development of knowledge on the technique and progress in the application of the technique in areas outside farming. This proposal excludes cloning carried out in research, for the preservation of rare breeds or endangered species and for the production of medicinal products and medical devices."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of the powers conferred on it by the Council, the European Commission has conducted negotiations with Madagascar with a view to renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and this country. At the end of the negotiations a new draft protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 19 June 2014. It is now necessary to conclude the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and Madagascar. Objectives: the primary objective of the Protocol to the Agreement is to grant fishing opportunities to EU vessels in the fishing zone of the Republic of Madagascar, in line with the management measures adopted by the relevant Regional Fisheries Management Organisation, namely the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) and where relevant, in keeping within the limits of the available surplus. The general objective is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Madagascar, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of Madagascar, in the interests of both parties. Financial contribution: the annual financial contribution, which is EUR 1 566 250 for each of the first two years of the Protocol and EUR 1 487 500 for each of the following two years, is based on: In the event of the annual amount of catches of the species referred to the Protocol exceeds the reference tonnage of 15 750 tonnes, the amount of the annual financial contribution shall be increased by EUR 55 during the first two years of the Protocol, and EUR 50 during the last two years for each additional tonne caught. However, the annual amount paid by the European Union in respect of access to Madagascar’s fishing zone shall not be more than twice the amount of the tonnage reference for the corresponding year. If the amounts caught by European Union vessels in Madagascar’s fishing zone exceed a quantity corresponding to twice that total annual amount, the amount due in respect of the quantity exceeding that limit shall be paid the following year. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: New fishing opportunities: the new fishing opportunities and technical measures may be reviewed by mutual agreement within the Joint Committee. They may be adjusted by the Joint Committee insofar as the resolutions and recommendations adopted by the IOTC confirm that such adjustments guarantee the sustainable management of the fish species covered by this Protocol. In this case, the financial contribution shall be adjusted proportionately and pro rata temporis. Exploratory fishing surveys may be authorised in the Malagasy fishing zone to test the technical feasibility and economic viability of new fisheries. Duration of the Agreement: the new Protocol covers a period of four years from the date of provisional application – i.e. from the date of its signature and 1 January 2015 at the earliest. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the total financial envelope allocated to this Protocol amounts to EUR 6.602 million from 2015 to 2018, including administrative management costs and human resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Trade Organization (WTO) launched the Doha Round of trade negotiations, known as the Doha Development Agenda in November 2001. The negotiations on trade facilitation were launched in July 2004, based on a commitment to clarify and improve several articles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994): such as those concerning: (i) freedom of transit); (ii) fees and formalities connected with importation and exportation); (iii) publication and administration of trade regulations. Moreover, the mandate referred to provisions for effective cooperation between customs or any other appropriate authorities on trade facilitation and customs compliance issues. The 9th WTO Ministerial Conference held in Bali on 3-6 December 2013 adopted the Ministerial Decision on Trade Facilitation, which concluded negotiations on the Agreement on Trade Facilitation subject to the legal review of the text. At its meeting on 26 November 2014, the WTO's General Council adopted the Protocol amending the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation and opened it for acceptance by the WTO Members. The Protocol should now be concluded on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to conclude the protocol amending the Marrakesh agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. The protocol includes the Agreement on Trade facilitation and the commitments will become an integral part of the Agreement. The Agreement contains a set of measures designed to improve the cross-border movement of goods by improving transparency, streamlining customs procedures and eliminating red tape. For developing countries, it also contains innovative flexibilities which may become standard in future rules type agreements. The Agreement is divided into two sections: The OECD Trade Facilitation Indicators estimate that comprehensive implementation of all measures of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation would reduce total trade costs by 10% in developed countries and by 13-15.5% in developing countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: The Union is working towards the establishment of a common judicial area based on the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions. The Budapest Convention on the contract for the carriage of goods by inland waterways (CMNI) is a valuable instrument for promoting inland navigation across Europe. The Convention has been adopted by the Diplomatic Conference organised jointly by the Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine and the Danube Commission in collaboration with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The Budapest Convention is not open to participation by regional economic integration organisations. As a result, the Union is not in a position to become a Contracting Party to the Budapest Convention. Eleven of the Member States of the Union, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovakia are Contracting Parties to the Budapest Convention. Belgium ratified the Convention on 5 August 2008. Austria and Poland, which have navigable inland waterways coming within the scope of the Convention, expressed their interest in becoming Contracting Parties. The remaining Member States of the Union indicated that they do not have inland waterways covered by the Budapest Convention and thus they do not have an interest in ratifying or acceding to the Convention. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council authorise Austria and Poland to ratify or to accede to, the Budapest Convention on the Contract for the Carriage of Goods by Inland Waterways (CMNI). The Convention, which entered into force on 1 April 2005, has proven to be a great success and contributes to the internal market in the field of transport. It aims to harmonise contractual and inland navigational standards among European countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No 29) of the ILO is one of the ILO’s eight fundamental Conventions that make up the core international labour standards, and it is considered a human rights instrument.. Yet, more than 80 years later, despite almost universal ratification of the Convention, the practice still exists, albeit in different forms to those that provoked such concern in the early twentieth century. The ILO estimates that at least 20.9 million people globally are victims of forced labour. In 2014, the International Labour Conference adopted the Protocol on the forced labour convention seeks to address gaps in implementation and to make progress on preventing trafficking for labour exploitation and protecting and compensating victims of forced labour. The European Union (EU) is committed to promoting human rights and decent work and to eradicating trafficking in human beings, both internally and in its external relations. In ratifying ILO Conventions and related Protocols, EU Member States send an important signal on the coherence of the EU’s policy in promoting fundamental principles and rights at work and improving working conditions worldwide. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to authorise the Member States to ratify the Protocol of 2014 to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, of the International Labour Organisation. The Protocol is a binding international agreement, subject to ratification, and is linked to the Convention. It creates legal obligations applicable to ratifying States and can only be ratified by States that have ratified the Convention. In accordance with case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ), and more specifically on concluding and ratifying an ILO Convention, Member States are not able to decide to ratify the Protocol outside the framework of the EU’s institutions, as parts of the Protocol fall into areas of EU competence. However, the EU as such cannot ratify an ILO Protocol, because under the ILO rules only States can be parties to such Protocols. The Protocol’s provisions strengthen the international legal framework by establishing obligations to prevent forced labour and to provide victims with protection and access to remedies, such as compensation. The Protocol sets out the measures that ILO Member States must take to prevent forced labour, namely: The Protocol addresses areas of EU law that are already subject to an advanced degree of regulation: (i) certain aspects relating to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, in respect of which EU law sets minimum standards on anti-trafficking and victims’ rights; (ii) certain aspects relating to rules on asylum and immigration. The Commission proposes that the Decision should be based on the one hand on Article 218(6) TFEU, in conjunction with Article 82(2) TFEU, which provides the main legal basis for EU legislation on judicial cooperation in criminal matters relevant to addressing trafficking in human beings and victims’ rights. The provisions of the draft Protocol other than the provisions related to judicial cooperation in criminal matters will be subject to a Decision adopted in parallel to this Decision. The Decision recommends that Member States should take the necessary steps to deposit their instruments of ratification of the Protocol with the Director-General of the International Labour Office as soon as possible, preferably by 31 December 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Greece has been affected by the consequences of the financial crisis in a unique manner. It has led to persistently negative GDP growth rates in Greece over a number of years, which, in turn, has caused serious liquidity shortages and a lack of public funds available for the public investment needed to foster a sustainable recovery. This has created an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed with specific measures. However, it is vital that the lack of liquidity and of public funds in Greece do not hinder investment under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund (the Funds) and by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF). In its Communication entitled ""A new start for Jobs and Growth in Greece"", the Commission proposed measures to ensure that the available EU funding from the Funds and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), is effectively used for investments on the ground and reaches beneficiaries as rapidly as possible. CONTENT: as an exceptional measure and given the unique situation this has created in Greece, the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 on the common provisions on the European Structural and European Investment Funds as follows: in order to ensure that Greece has sufficient financial means to start the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes supported by the Funds and the EMFF in 2015 and 2016, the Commission proposes to increase the level of the initial pre-financing paid to its operational programmes under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Goal and to programmes supported by the EMFF through the payment of an additional initial prefinancing amount in those years to give an immediate boost to investment; in order to improve the effective use of available cohesion policy funding for the financing of operations under programmes adopted for the 2007-2013 period, it proposes to increase the maximum co-financing rates and to raise the ceiling for payments to programmes at the end of the programming period. In concrete terms, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to allow for the ceiling for the cumulative total of pre-financing and interim payments to be 100% and to increase the co-financing rate for 2007-2013 operational programmes for the Convergence and the Regional competitiveness and employment objectives in Greece to 100%. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed consists of frontloading payment appropriations and is budgetary neutral over the 2014-2020 period. The additional payment appropriations necessary to cover the immediate consequence of an increase of 2007-2013 co-financing rates and removal of the ceiling for payments are EUR 500 million in 2015 and EUR 500 million for the additional initial pre-financing in 2015. These additional payment appropriations can potentially be covered by payment appropriations foreseen for interim payments for the 2014-2020 programmes depending on the progress of submission of interim payment applications in 2015. The additional pre-financing of EUR 500 million for 2016 was however not foreseen in the draft budget 2016 . Nor was the impact in 2016 of the increase in the maximum co-financing rates and in the ceiling for payments for 2007-2013 programmes. The Commission is therefore likely to propose to cover the additional payment needs through an amending letter to the 2016 draft. The estimated impact on 2017 will be included in the next budgetary procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes and agencies to ENP partner countries is one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union’s neighbourhood. The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication “on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes”. The Council endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007. The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. In December 2013, Tunisia expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Tunisia is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now appropriate for the European Union to conclude the protocol. LEGAL BASIS: Article 212 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and Article 218(7) thereof. CONTENT: this is a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol. This Protocol contains a Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Tunisia in Union programmes. It contains standard conditions that should be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with whom such protocols are to be concluded. Objectives: the protocol seeks to define the financial and technical rules permitting Tunisia to participate in certain EU programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol sets out principles for economic, financial and technical cooperation measure and allows Tunisia to receive technical assistance, in particular financial assistance, from the European Union pursuant to the European Union programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation 861/2007 established an alternative procedure in addition to the procedures existing under the laws of the Member States, for cross-border cases concerning claims which do not exceed EUR 2 000. The Regulation is applied in the EU (except in Denmark) as of 1 January 2009. Despite the benefits it could bring in terms of reducing the costs and time of litigating cross-border claims, the procedure is still little known and remains under-used several years after the entry into application of the Regulation. A Eurobarometer survey carried out in 2012, showed that 12% of the respondents were aware of the existence of the ESCP, with 1% of all respondents declaring that they already used the procedure. 69% of those who already used the procedure were satisfied. The survey also showed that the most important factors which would encourage citizens to go to court are: the possibility of carry out proceedings in writing without appearing in the court (33%), conducting proceedings without instructing a lawyer (26%), conducting proceedings on-line (20%) and using their own language (24%). The European Parliament affirmed in a 2011 resolution that more needs to be done in terms of legal certainty, language barriers and transparency of proceedings. It called on the Commission to take steps to ensure that consumers and businesses are made more aware and make use of existing legislative instruments, such as the European Small Claims Procedure. The Commission identified the revision of the Regulation in its 2013 EU Citizenship Report as one of the actions strengthening the rights of Union citizens, by facilitating the settlement of disputes regarding purchases made in another Member State. This initiative is included in the European Consumer Agenda. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: having carried out several consultations of interested parties, the Commission also undertook an impact assessment in support of its proposal. CONTENT : the Commission proposes to revise Regulation (EC) nº 861/2007 as follows: Extend the scope of the Regulation to cross-border claims up to EUR 10,000: raising the current threshold will allow parties to litigate a substantially bigger number of cases on the basis of the simplified European procedure. SMEs will be the main beneficiaries, but consumers will also benefit, since about one fifth of consumer claims exceed EUR 2,000. Extend the definition of cross border cases : the amendment means that the European Small Claim Procedure may be used in disputes involving parties domiciled in the same Member State which have a significant cross-border element and includes third-country residents. Improve the use of electronic means of communication , including for service of documents: the proposal will put postal service and electronic service on the same footing. For other, less important communications between the parties and the courts, the proposal will make electronic communication the rule, subject only to the agreement of the parties. Impose an obligation on courts to use videoconferencing, teleconferencing or other means of distance communication for the conduct of oral hearings and taking of evidence: oral hearings should be conducted through videoconferencing or other means of distance communication. In order to safeguard the rights of the parties, an exception will be made for the party who expressly requests to be present in court. Provide a maximum limitation on court fees charged for the procedure: the proposed amendment will not harmonise court fees in the Member States. Instead, it would set a maximum cap on court fees for applications under the Regulation, increasing the attractiveness of the procedure for claimants. The measure allows Member States to maintain a fixed minimum court fee. Provide for an obligation on the Member States to put in place on-line means of payment of court fees : when payment in cash or stamps is the only acceptable means of payment, parties may be discouraged from pursuing their claims. The proposal aims at obliging Member States to put in place distance means of payment, as a minimum bank transfers and credit/debit card on-line payment systems. Limit the requirement to translate the certificate of enforcement in Form D to only the substance of the judgment: the obligation to translate Form D imposes unnecessary costs. The amendment will limit the requirement of translation to the substance of the judgment in point 4.3 of Form D only. Impose information obligations on Member States in respect of court fees, methods of payment of court fees and the availability of assistance in filling in the forms. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only implications for the budget of the European Union resulting from the proposed Regulation consist of the one-off costs for the preparation of a report 5 years after the date of application of the Regulation. The operational and administrative costs are estimated at EUR 437, 000 for the period 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: medium combustion plants are used for a wide variety of applications (including electricity generation, domestic/residential heating and cooling and providing heat/steam for industrial processes, etc.) and are an important source of emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter. The approximate number of medium combustion plants in the EU is 142 986. Emissions of air pollutants from medium combustion plants are generally not regulated at EU level. The Commission considers it appropriate to complement the existing legislation relating to combustion plants with provisions for this category. The Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ""A Clean Air Programme for Europe"" calls for action to control emissions of air polluting substances from combustion plants with a rated thermal input between 1 and 50 MW, thereby completing the regulatory framework for the combustion sector also with a view of increasing the synergies between air pollution and climate change policies. The present proposal is part of the new framework of action in the field of air quality in the EU, as set out in the revised EU Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution, and is consistent with and reinforces the Europe 2020 objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the analysis concluded that there is a need to propose a legislative instrument for controlling emission from such plants at EU-level. Out of the five policy options considered and in depth analysed to control emissions from medium combustion plants, the preferred option would set emission limit values in line with those set in Directive 2010/75/EU for plants between 50-100 MW and in a number of Member States, and complemented with a number of emission limit values set out for new plants in the amended Gothenburg Protocol. CONTENT: the proposed Directive seeks to lay down emission limit values to control emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the air from medium combustion plants as minimum standards of protection for the environment and for all citizens of the EU. It introduces minimum requirements, keeping the administrative burden at the lowest possible level and taking special account of the situation of SMEs. In concrete terms, the proposal: sets out the obligation of the competent authority to register medium combustion plants, based on notification by the operator; sets out the emission limit values apply to existing combustion plants after a fixed period (from 1 January 2025 emissions into air of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from an existing medium combustion plant with a rated thermal input above 5 MW shall not exceed the emission limit values; from 1 January 2030 emissions into air of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from an existing medium combustion plant with a rated thermal input of 5 MW or less shall not exceed the emission limit values); requires Member States to apply more stringent emission limit values to individual plants in zones not complying with air quality limit values; lays down a provision to require operators to immediately report on non-compliance to the competent authority; obliges Member States: (i) to ensure that the operator and the competent authority take necessary measures in case of non-compliance with this Directive; (ii) introduces requirements for Member States to provide for a system of environmental inspections of medium combustion plants covered by this Directive, or implement other measures to check compliance thereof; provides for the obligations of the operator and the competent authority in case of changes to a medium combustion plant; is concerned with the right of access to information and refers to Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on public access to environmental information; requires Member States to designate the competent authorities responsible for carrying out the obligations arising from this Directive; establishes a reporting mechanism. While Member States' first report to the Commission, due by 30 June 2019, shall contain a summary of data of key importance in implementing this Directive, the following reports shall contain qualitative and quantitative information on the implementation of this Directive; lays down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of the national provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 83/417/EEC provides for the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption. Since the entry into force of that Directive several changes have taken place, notably the development of a comprehensive legal framework in the area of food law and the adoption of an international standard by the Codex Alimentarius for edible casein products, which need to be taken into account. Directive 83/417/EEC confers powers on the Commission in order to implement some of its provisions. As a consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, those powers need to be aligned to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the Treaty) which allows the legislator to delegate to the Commission the power to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act. For the sake of clarity, Directive 83/417/EEC should therefore be repealed and replaced with a new Directive CONTENT: the proposal is aimed at designing the Commission's empowerment in the new legal context created by the Lisbon Treaty. It also takes account of the further development of legislation in the past years and of existing, updated international standards. The proposal: identifies the need for delegated power to be conferred on the Commission for the purpose of adopting amendments to Annexes I and II and establishes the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts in the new legal context determined by the entry into force of Articles 290 and 291 of the TFEU; adapts existing provisions to the further development of legislation notably in the field of food law; adjust, where appropriate, the composition requirements of edible caseins to the corresponding Codex standard . This adjustment results in two changes: the maximum moisture content of edible casein is increased from 10 to 12% and the maximum milk fat content of edible acid casein is decreased from 2.25 to 2%. With this change, the compositional requirements laid down in the proposal are fully in line with the international standard so as to avoid trade distortions. Moreover the proposal takes into consideration the need for the Member States to have some margin to adapt the implementation to the national legal and administrative environment, in particular with reference to the possible adoption of national measures in matters not specifically harmonised by the proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for the establishment and the implementation of the general budget of the European Union. In particular, it also contains rules on public procurement. Following the adoption of Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC and of Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on the award of concession contracts, provision should be made for the rules contained in these Directives to apply to contracts awarded by the European institutions on their own account. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU, EURATOM) No 966/2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union in order to take account of the new directives on public procurement and on the award of concession contracts awarded by the European institutions on their own account. The modifications brought about to the text of the Financial Regulation (FR) can be classified into three main groups. Alignment with the Directive : new provisions are introduced, such as market consultation, the new innovation partnership as a procedure, the introduction of compliance with environmental, social and labour law as a key requirement, evaluation of criteria in no particular order, award methodology based on the most economically advantageous tender. In addition, concessions for works and services are introduced for the first time in the FR and are subject to the same types of procedures as public contracts. Provisions on exclusion : the grounds for exclusion are clarified and aligned with the Directive as well as the possibility for the economic operator concerned to take remedial measures. Exclusion is clearly separated from the rejection from a given procedure to avoid confusion. A single system is set up for increasing the protection of the Union financial interests which takes into account the existing Central Exclusion Database. The aim of the system is to ensure the early detection and prevention of risk as well as the publication of information related to excluded economic operators. An exclusion panel is set up to take exclusion decisions after the analysis of the case and it guarantees the right of defence of economic operators. Clarifications of the text and simplifications : these concern publicity measures above and below thresholds, requirements for opening and evaluation, rejection of non-compliant tenders, bank guarantees for works and complex services contracts, the fact that Union institutions are considered central contracting authorities according to the Directive, the reference to applicable Directive thresholds, electronic procedures and the opening up of procurement by institutions to international organisations."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council (amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2013/36/EU and 2009/110/EC and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress and integration of retail payments in the EU have been achieved over the past 12 years, with the current regulatory and legislative acquis on payments. Moreover, the retail payments market is very dynamic and has experienced a significant innovation pace in the last few years. At the same time, important areas of the payments market, especially card payments and new means of payments, such as internet and mobile payments, are often still fragmented along national borders making it difficult for innovative and easy-to-use digital payment services to develop efficiently and to provide consumers and retailers with convenient and secure payment methods. The review of the European framework and notably Directive 2007/64/EC on the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the consultation on the Commission Green Paper ‘Towards an integrated European market for card, internet and mobile payments’ in 2012 have led to the conclusion that further measures and regulatory updates, including adjustments to the PSD, are required. In the Commission’s 2012 Communication “Single Market Act II – Together for new growth”, the modernisation of the legislative framework for retail payments has been identified as a key priority in view of its potential for new growth and innovation. The revision of the PSD and the preparation of a legislative proposal on multilateral interchange fees for card payments were defined as one of the key actions of the Commission for 2013. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that the best policy options to improve the existing situation by (i) reinforcing the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) project; (ii) facilitating standardisation through adequate governance framework; (iii) ensuring legal certainty in the field of interchange fees for card-based payments; (iv) abolishing restrictive business rules for card payments; (v) defining conditions of access to the information on the availability of funds for third party providers; (vi) adjusting the scope and improve the consistency of the legislative framework; (vii) reinforcing the rights of payment services users and safeguard the consumer rights in view of the regulatory changes. CONTENT: this proposal also incorporates and repeals Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Payment Services Directive which sets the basis for a harmonised legal framework for the creation of an integrated payments market. It aims to update and complement the current framework on payments services by providing for rules that enhance transparency, innovation and security in the field of retail payments and improving consistency between national rules, with an emphasis on the legitimate needs of consumers. More specifically, the proposed measures seek to: ensure a competitive level playing field between all categories of payment service providers, including new emerging providers, which in turn increases the choice, efficiency, transparency and security of retail payments; facilitate the provision of innovative card, internet and mobile payment services across borders by ensuring a Single Market for all retail payments; address standardisation and interoperability gaps for card, internet and mobile payments; eliminate hurdles for competition , in particular for card and internet payments; align charging and steering practices for payment services across the EU; ensure that emerging types of payment services and instruments are covered by the regulatory framework for retail payments in the EU; ensure a consistent application of the legislative framework (PSD) and align the practical operation of the licensing and supervisory rules for payment services across Member States; ensure adequate and consistent protection of consumer interests in the context of payment transactions, including extending regulatory protection to new channels and innovative payment services. The proposed measures seek to implement this reform in a technologically neutral manner that will remain relevant as payment services evolve further. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : the impact on the EU budget is estimated at EUR 609 000 for the period 2015-2020. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains measures empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

Improve transparency and certainty of Union law is the main aim of this Agreement. The Commission has carried out several exercises to remove obsolete legislation from the acquis, partly through the traditional repeal procedure, partly by declaring the relevant Commission acts obsolete. The Commission identified two Council acts related to the Common Agricultural Policy, which are based upon Article 42 and 43 of the Treaty (former Articles 36 and 37), which have exhausted all practical effects, but are formally still in force. CONTENT: for reasons of legal security and clarity, the Commission proposes to repeal two legal acts relating to the common agricultural policy which have become obsolete, even though formally they are still in force: Council Directive 76/621/EEC . The content of that Directive has been taken up by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1881/20063; Council Regulation (EC) No 320/2006 . The temporary scheme established by that Regulation was applicable only until the marketing year 2009/2010."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 allows Member States to adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use of authorised GMOs and GM food and feed only if they are able to demonstrate that the product in question is likely to pose risks to health and to the environment. The Regulation requires the Commission as risk manager to take a decision on an application for authorisation in a reasonable period of time (to grant an authorisation or refuse an authorisation). Since the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, there has never been a qualified majority amongst Member States in favour of or against a draft Commission Decision authorising Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and Genetically Modified (GM) food and feed. The result has always been a “no opinion” for all stages of the procedure. As a result, the authorisation decisions have been adopted by the Commission, in accordance with applicable legislation, without the support of the Member States’ committee opinion. Regarding cultivation of GMOs , Directive (EU) 2015/412 grants Member States more flexibility to decide whether or not they wish to cultivate GMOs on their territory without affecting the risk assessment provided in the system of Union authorisations of GMOs. However, that Directive does not cover GMOs and GM food and feed authorised under Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. In its Communication on the reviewing the decision-making process on genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the Communication concluded that the current legal framework should be amended, by extending the approach agreed in Directive (EU) 2015/412 to other products covered by the Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003. CONTENT: the Commission proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 to introduce new provisions allowing Member States to restrict or prohibit the use of GMOs and GM food and feed covered by the GMO legal framework, in part or all of their territory, in complement to the possibilities already offered to Member States with respect to GMOs for cultivation by Directive (EU) 2015/412. The proposal does not affect the Union procedure of authorisation based on risks which should remain harmonised at Union level in order to maintain a same level of safety throughout the EU. According to the proposed Regulation, Member States may adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use GMOs or GM food and feed products provided that such measures are: reasoned and based on compelling grounds in accordance with Union law which shall, in no case, conflict with the risk assessment carried out pursuant this Regulation; proportional and non-discriminatory . Where a Member State intends to adopt measures restricting or prohibiting the use of products, it shall first submit to the Commission a draft of those measures, and the corresponding justification. The Commission shall immediately notify to the other Member States the draft measures and the corresponding justification. During a period of 3 months from the date of submission to the Commission of the draft measures and various information: the Member State shall refrain from adopting and implementing those measures; the Commission and the Member States may make any comments they consider appropriate to the Member State which has submitted the draft measures. The proposal does not allow Member States to restrict or prohibit the use of products which do not have to be labelled under the GMO legal framework, even if they may contain a small proportion of GMOs or GM food and feed below the thresholds set out therein. Provisions are also established to protect the rights of economic operators which lawfully placed on the market a GMO or a GM food and feed before the Member State adopt measures pursuant to the proposal. Sufficient time should be given to operators to allow the phasing out of the product from the market."

PROPOSED ACT : Regulation of the European Council and of the Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : Union rules on novel foods were set out in Regulation (EC) n° 258/97 of the European Parliament and Council and Commission Regulation (EC) n° 1852/2001. Those rules need to be updated to simplify the current authorisation procedures and to take account of recent developments in Union law. In January 2008, the Commission adopted a proposal aiming to simplify the authorization procedure set out in Regulation (EC) 258/97 on novel foods. The legislative discussions under the ordinary legislative procedure mainly focused on the provisions applicable to: (i) nanomaterials; (ii) the cloning of animals for food production; (iii) traditional foods from third countries; (iv) the criteria to be examined for the risk assessment, and (v) risk management and to the procedure for the authorisation of novel foods in accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Lisbon Treaty). However, the proposal was not adopted after the Conciliation Committee failed to reach an agreement in March 2011. The Commission considers that issues related to cloning of farm animals should be addressed in a separate proposal, based on an impact assessment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the 2008 impact assessment is still valid, and the rationale for an in-depth revision of the current legislation remains unchanged (the length and cost of the current authorisation procedure, the need for a centralised risk assessment and risk management and for an adjusted procedure for the placing on the EU market of traditional foods from third countries). CONTENT : the proposal brings together and updates the provisions of the legislation currently in force, which will be repealed at the time of entry into application of the new legislation. It aims to streamline the authorisation procedure for novel foods, to improve its efficiency and transparency. It is limited to the safety of novel food and is based on the overall agreement achieved in conciliation. The main points are as follows: Subject matter, scope and definitions · novel foods will be subject to safety evaluation and authorisation through a fully harmonised procedure; · the definition of novel foods is clarified, bearing in mind new technologies which have an impact on food. · a simplified procedure is created for marketing of traditional foods from third countries; · nanomaterials which are intended for food uses and covered by the definition of ""engineered nanomaterials"", as laid down in Regulation (EU) n°1169/2011 on food information to consumers, shall be assessed and authorised under this Regulation before being placed on the EU market. Requirements for placing novel foods on the market within the Union: · all novel foods and their use must not present a danger to human health and their use should not mislead the consumer; · for every authorised novel food, specifications, labelling requirements, conditions of use and, where appropriate, a requirement of post-market monitoring may be laid down; · the current system of individual authorisations is replaced by a system of generic authorisation; · novel foods already authorised shall continue to be marketed and will be included in the Union list of novel foods. Authorisation procedure for a novel food · all applications for the authorisation of novel foods shall be submitted to the Commission which may then request a scientific opinion on risk assessment from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA); · the inclusion of a novel food in the Union list of novel foods will be considered by the Commission on the basis of the opinion from EFSA. For traditional foods from third countries, a safety assessment and a risk management, based on a history of safe food use, is introduced: · if the applicant has shown a history of safe food use in a third country for at least 25 years, and if the Member States or EFSA do not present reasoned safety objections based on scientific evidence, the food may be included in the Union list; · where reasoned safety objections are presented, an EFSA assessment followed by an EU authorisation procedure, similar to the standard authorisation procedure but with shorter deadlines, is required. Additional procedural rules and other requirements · the information provided by the applicant should be kept confidential where the disclosure of such information might significantly harm their competitive position. Data protection · in order to support innovation in the EU food industry and only in duly justified cases, individual authorisations with data protection may be granted for a maximum period of five years. Penalties and committee procedure · rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of the proposed Regulation will be laid down; · implementation of the measures proposed in the Regulation will be mainly adopted by the Commission. This relates to the conditions of use and labelling of a novel food as well as laying down specifications and, where appropriate post-market monitoring requirements. Transitional provisions · transitional measures are set out to ensure a smooth transition with on-going applications and notifications, pending the entry into application of this legislation; · to enhance legal certainty, a food that was legally placed on the market prior to the application of this Regulation, should be allowed to be continued to be marketed until the risk assessment and authorisation procedures have been concluded. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : operational resources necessary for implementation of the proposal will be covered by redeployment within the contribution granted to EFSA during the annual budgetary procedure. The estimated impact on appropriations of an administrative nature is EUR 2.750 million for the period 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 543/2014 amending Council Decision 2005/681/JHA, which entered into force on 29 May 2014 transferred the seat of CEPOL from Bramshill in the United Kingdom to Budapest in Hungary. On 27 March 2013, the Commission made a proposal for a Regulation updating the legal framework of the European Police Office (Europol). This proposal pursued several aims, one of which being merging CEPOL with Europol to create synergies between operational law enforcement work and training activities. The European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger of CEPOL with Europol. Instead, a regulation moving the seat of CEPOL as an independent agency to Budapest, Hungary, was adopted on 6 May 2014. Due to the opposition to the proposed merger, other parts of the Europol proposal relating to training were not discussed by the European Parliament and the Council in detail. This proposal for a Regulation draws – except as regards the question of merging CEPOL with Europol which has since been decided by the co-legislators – on preparatory work carried out in 2011 and 2012 by the Commission on the modernisation of CEPOL's legal basis. It therefore provides for a legal framework for a new CEPOL with broader objectives and modernised governance, which repeals and replaces CEPOL as established by Council Decision 2005/681/JHA. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted two impact assessments of policy alternatives concerning Europol and CEPOL. The impact assessment on CEPOL was based on the two policy objectives of: (i) ensuring better quality, more joined-up and more consistent training for a wider range of law enforcement officers in cross-border crime issues; (ii) establishing a framework to achieve this in line with the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. The analysis of the overall impact led, in the context of the Europol Regulation proposal, to a preferred policy option which was the merger of CEPOL into Europol. However, given that the European Parliament and the Council did not agree to the proposed merger in May 2014, this proposal for a regulation accordingly maintains CEPOL as an independent agency, with its seat in Budapest. Any other option would, at this point in time, generate additional costs and create uncertainty for the Agency's future and its staff which would adversely affect its ability to deliver on its objectives. CONTENT: this proposal aims to: give CEPOL the appropriate legal mandate and the necessary resources to implement the training effort set out in the Commission Communication on European Law Enforcement Training Scheme; improve the governance of CEPOL by seeking increased efficiency and aligning it with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies. (1) Implementation of a European approach to training : in line with the principles laid down in the Commission communication on the European Law Enforcement Training Scheme (LETS), the scope of CEPOL’s mandate is broadened so that it can support, develop, deliver and coordinate learning activities for law enforcement officials of all ranks (not only police officers of senior rank as is the case under the current CEPOL Decision ) as well as to officers of customs and of other relevant services dealing with cross-border issues. The proposal envisages that the Agency will remain network-based, bringing together the network of training institutes of the Member States for the law enforcement officials and liaising with a single National unit in each Member State. The objectives of CEPOL are updated and clarified so that the Agency may: improve awareness and knowledge of international and Union instruments, the institutions, agencies and bodies of the European Union; encourage the development of the regional or bilateral cooperation among the Member States; address specific criminal or policing thematic areas where training at EU level can add value in addition to the national level; provide appropriate and preliminary training sessions for the participation in civilian missions in third Countries. (2) Improved governance : the proposal improves the governance of CEPOL by streamlining procedures, notably with respect to the Management Board and the Executive Director, and by aligning CEPOL with the principles laid down in the Common Approach on EU decentralised agencies, keeping in mind that CEPOL, as a centre of EU learning activities, should continue to rely on the network of the training institutes of the Member States and liaise with a single National unit in each Member State. The Commission and the Member States are represented on the Management Board of CEPOL. Appointment procedure : in line with the mandate of the Agency, the members of the Management Board are appointed on the basis of their knowledge of training for law enforcement officers, taking into account relevant managerial, administrative and budgetary skills. The Management Board will be advised by a scientific committee on technical training issues (Scientific Committee for Training). Management Board tasks : the Management Board is given the necessary powers, in particular to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules and planning documents, establish transparent working procedures for decision-making by the Executive Director of CEPOL, adopt the annual activity report, and appoint an Executive Director. In order to ensure efficient day-to-day functioning of CEPOL, the Executive Director is its legal representative and manager. The Executive Director is completely independent in the performance of his/her tasks and ensures that CEPOL carries out the tasks foreseen in this Regulation. In particular, the Executive Director is responsible for preparing budgetary and planning documents submitted for the decision of the Management Board. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the adoption of this Regulation will have no additional financial implication. An estimated EUR 6.092 million of staff costs (excl. schooling fees) will be saved over the period 2016-2020 as a result of the relocation from Bramshill to Budapest and the difference in the correction coefficient between the United Kingdom and Hungary. Schooling fees for children of CEPOL’s staff will constitute an additional cost of EUR 1.868 million over the same period. An estimated EUR 0.658 million will be saved as a result of lower costs of building, equipment and management board expenses over the same period. The relocation of around 40 staff from CEPOL’s current site in Bramshill, United Kingdom, to the new site in Budapest, Hungary, will have taken place before this proposal for a Regulation enters into force. In total, therefore, the budgetary impact of the legislative proposal amounts to EUR 45.383 million for CEPOL, as an independent Agency established in Budapest, over the period 2016-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2008 global financial crisis revealed important regulatory gaps in the financial system. It also highlighted the need to improve transparency and monitoring not only in the traditional banking sector but also in areas where non-bank credit activities took place, called “shadow banking”. Confronted with new legislative developments in the banking sector, including structural measures, it is possible that banks will shift parts of their activity into less regulated areas as shadow banking. At the end of 2012 global shadow banking assets accounted for EUR 53 trillion, representing about half the size of the regulated banking system and mainly concentrated in Europe (around EUR 23 trillion) and in the United States (around EUR 19.3 trillion). On 19 March 2012, the Commission published a Green Paper on shadow banking, and on 4 September 2013, it published a Communication on the subject. It stressed that the complex and opaque nature of securities financing transactions (SFTs) makes it difficult to identify counterparties and monitor risk concentration. This also leads to the built-up of excessive leverage in the financial system. A High-Level Expert Group chaired by Erkki Liikanen adopted a report on reforming the structure of the Union banking sector in October 2012. The report recognised the risks of shadow banking activities such as high leverage and pro- cyclicality, and it called for a reduction of the interconnectedness between banks and the shadow banking system, which had been a source of contagion in a system-wide banking crisis. Actions regarding these matters have been international and coordinated through the G20 and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) which, in August 2013, adopted a policy framework consisting of eleven Recommendations addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repos. These Recommendations were subsequently endorsed in September 2013 by the G20 Leaders. In order to closely follow market trends regarding entities whose activities qualify as shadow banking, in particular in the area of securities financing transactions, the Commission feels it necessary to implement transparency requirements. The proposal regarding structural reforms of the EU banking sector, which is presented in a package with this proposal, is the final piece of the new regulatory framework, ensuring that even the largest banks in the EU become less complex and can be effectively resolved, with minimum implications for tax payers. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that a combination of different measures is necessary including reporting of SFTs to trade repositories, disclosure on the use of SFTs to fund investors, and the need for prior consent to rehypothecation of the financial instruments. The latter must be transferred to an account opened in the name of the receiving counterparty before rehypothecation can take place. This will ensure that the shadow banking activity of using SFTs is properly supervised and regulated. The use of SFTs as such will not be prohibited nor limited by specific restrictions but be more transparent. CONTENT: the Regulation aims at enhancing financial stability in the EU by means of increasing transparency of certain market activities, such as SFTs, rehypothecation and other financing structures having equivalent economic effect as SFTs. The Regulation introduces measures to improve the transparency in three main areas: (1) the monitoring of the build-up of systemic risks related to SFT transactions in the financial system; (2) the disclosure of the information on such transactions to the investors whose assets are employed in these or equivalent transactions; and (3) the contractual transparency of rehypothecation activities. In practice, the proposed measures will cover the FSB recommendations, these being: The obligation for competent authorities to collect additional data on the use of SFTs: the draft Regulation creates a Union framework under which financial or non-financial counterparties of a SFT will efficiently report the details of the transaction to trade repositories. This information will be centrally stored and easily and directly accessible to the relevant authorities, such as ESMA, ESRB, the ESCB, for the purpose of identification and monitoring of financial stability risks entailed by shadow banking activities of regulated and non-regulated entities. The requirement that requires fund managers be transparent towards their investors: in order to enable investors to become aware of the risks associated with the use of SFTs and other financing structures, fund managers should include detailed information on any recourse they have to these techniques in regular reporting intervals. The existing periodical reports that UCITS management or investment companies and AIF managers have to produce will be supplemented by this additional information on the use of SFTs and other financing structures. The requirement for financial intermediaries to provide sufficient disclosure to their clients in relation to re-hypothecation of assets : any rehypothecation should therefore take place only with the express knowledge of inherent risks and prior consent of the providing counterparty in a contractual agreement and should be appropriately reflected in the securities accounts. The counterparty receiving financial instruments as collateral will be allowed to rehypothecate them only with the express consent of the providing counterparty and only after having them transferred to its own account. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal involves the hiring of two new temporary agents at EBA from January 2016. The new tasks will be carried out with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation procedure, and in line with the financial programming for agencies. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 19 May 2010 on a Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), the Commission stressed that interoperability is essential to maximise the social and economic potential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is ensured. As mentioned in its 2013 annual growth survey, the Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services and the digitisation of European public administrations to be important contributors to growth and increased efficiency. To enable efficient and effective interaction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their administrations and provide interoperable digital services at national and European level. However, because it takes place at national level and lacks European-level interoperability, such change very often throws up electronic barriers (‘e-barriers’) that prevent citizens and businesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth functioning of the internal market. Activities under the programmes put in place by the Commission since 1995 (IDA, IDABC and ISA) have contributed significantly to ensuring interoperability in the electronic exchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution of 20 April 2012, the European Parliament recognised the contribution and overarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the implementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations. It also called for an increase in the financial allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public administrations for 2014-2020. With the ISA Programme coming to an end on 31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens is needed. On 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public administrations should continue, with the swift implementation of services, such as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on interoperability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the 2012 interim evaluation for the ISA Programme, the Commission considers that the adoption of the new programme will help reduce the cost and administrative burden of cross-border interaction for all concerned, further improve the internal market and freedom of movement in the EU without administrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT systems supporting EU legislation. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to establish, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (‘the ISA2 programme’). The proposed programme succeeds the ISA Programme and will consolidate, promote and expand its activities. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: improve, operate and re-use existing cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; develop, operate and re-use new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; assess the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union legislation and identify areas in which new legislation could promote interoperability; create a European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) to be used as the tool for building and assessing interoperability solutions; create an instrument to facilitate the re-use of existing interoperability solutions and to identify the areas in which such solutions are still missing; assess and promote existing common specifications and standards and develop new common specifications and standards; introduce a mechanism that will measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 19 May 2010 on a Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), the Commission stressed that interoperability is essential to maximise the social and economic potential of ICT and that, consequently, the Digital Agenda can take off only if interoperability is ensured. As mentioned in its 2013 annual growth survey, the Commission considers the cross-border interoperability of online services and the digitisation of European public administrations to be important contributors to growth and increased efficiency. To enable efficient and effective interaction with citizens and businesses, Member States should modernise their administrations and provide interoperable digital services at national and European level. However, because it takes place at national level and lacks European-level interoperability, such change very often throws up electronic barriers (‘e-barriers’) that prevent citizens and businesses from using public services efficiently and impede the smooth functioning of the internal market. Activities under the programmes put in place by the Commission since 1995 (IDA, IDABC and ISA) have contributed significantly to ensuring interoperability in the electronic exchange of information between European public administrations. In its Resolution of 20 April 2012, the European Parliament recognised the contribution and overarching role of the ISA Programme in defining, promoting and supporting the implementation of interoperability solutions and frameworks for European public administrations. It also called for an increase in the financial allocations for interoperability solutions between the EU public administrations for 2014-2020. With the ISA Programme coming to an end on 31 December 2015, a new EU programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens is needed. On 24 and 25 October 2013, the European Council adopted conclusions stressing that the modernisation of public administrations should continue, with the swift implementation of services, such as e-government, e-health, e-invoicing and e-procurement that rely on interoperability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the 2012 interim evaluation for the ISA Programme, the Commission considers that the adoption of the new programme will help reduce the cost and administrative burden of cross-border interaction for all concerned, further improve the internal market and freedom of movement in the EU without administrative e-barriers, and contribute to the swift implantation of ICT systems supporting EU legislation. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to establish, for 2016-2020, a programme on interoperability solutions for European public administrations, businesses and citizens (‘the ISA2 programme’). The proposed programme succeeds the ISA Programme and will consolidate, promote and expand its activities. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: improve, operate and re-use existing cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; develop, operate and re-use new cross-border or cross-sector interoperability solutions; assess the ICT implications of proposed or adopted Union legislation and identify areas in which new legislation could promote interoperability; create a European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) to be used as the tool for building and assessing interoperability solutions; create an instrument to facilitate the re-use of existing interoperability solutions and to identify the areas in which such solutions are still missing; assess and promote existing common specifications and standards and develop new common specifications and standards; introduce a mechanism that will measure and quantify the benefits of interoperability solutions. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for implementation of the new ISA2 Programme for the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2020 is EUR 130 928 000. The proposed envelope is consistent with the current Multiannual Financial Framework for the years 2014-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) is a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBF) throughout its distribution. The Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin tuna entered into force on 20 May 1994. The European Union has been a Cooperating Non-Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission since 2006. Cooperating Non-Members participate fully in the activities of the CCSBT but are not entitled to vote. On 1 December 2009, the Council authorised the European Commission to seek, on behalf of the European Union, an amendment to the rules of Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna in order for the European Union to become a Contracting Party. During its 20th meeting in October 2013, the CCSBT amended the Resolution governing the Extended Commission to allow the European Union to become a Member of the CCSBT Extended Commission through Exchange of Letters. Since vessels flying the flags of Member States of the Union fish resources in the area of distribution of Southern Bluefin Tuna, it is in the Union's interest to play an effective role in the implementation of the Convention. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to conclude the legal process launched with the signature and provisional application of the Exchange of Letters to obtain membership of the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee after having obtained the consent from the European Parliament. Upon completion of this procedure, the EU would be entitled to membership and vote in the CCSBT Extended Commission and Extended Scientific Committee."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/92/EC regulates the point of sale of insurance products so as to ensure the rights of the consumer. The Directive is a minimum harmonisation instrument containing high level principles and has been implemented in the 27 Member States in substantially different ways. The need to review IMD1 was already acknowledged during the implementation check carried out by the Commission in 2005-2008. During the discussions in the European Parliament on Directive 2009/138/EC on the risk-based approach to capitalisation and supervision of insurance undertakings (Solvency II), a specific request was furthermore made to review IMD1. Some Members of the Parliament and some consumer organisations considered that there was a need for improved policyholder protection in the aftermath of the financial crisis and that selling practices for different insurance products could be improved. In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency, the European Parliament requested that the revision of IMD1 should take into account the ongoing revision of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). In November 2010, the G20 asked the OECD, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and other relevant international organisations to develop common principles in the field of financial services in order to strengthen consumer protection. The current review of IMD1 should be seen in the light of these guidelines and related international initiatives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options discussed in the impact assessment were assessed against different criteria: (i) market integration for market players; (ii) customer protection and confidence; (iii) a level playing field for various market players, and cost-effectiveness. Overall, the estimate of the administrative burden on the basis of an external study and industry statistics is that in view of the large number of undertakings affected (about 1 million), the proposal will result in a relatively moderate cost of, on average, about EUR 730 per undertaking. The impact assessment work finished in 2012. The European Commission Impact Assessment Board's recommendations were taken on board especially concerning the impact on SME's. In general, proportional requirements have been introduced to take account of SME's concerns and to respect the principle 'less complex products, less rules'. These intermediaries will be subject to a light touch regime. LEGAL BASIS: Article 53(1) and 62 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal for a recast directive seeks to improve regulation in the retail insurance market in an efficient manner. It aims at ensuring a level playing field between all participants involved in the selling of insurance products and at strengthening policyholder protection. Most of the issues dealt with by the revision are already covered by the current IMD1 legal framework. In concrete terms, the IMD2 project should achieve the following improvements: ·  expand the scope of application of IMD1 to all distribution channels (e.g. direct writers, car rentals, etc.). The draft directive brings within its scope certain ancillary sellers and after-sales businesses such as loss adjusters and claims handlers; ·  clarify the exercise of the freedom of establishment , of the freedom to provide services, and the powers of supervisory authorities of home and host Member States in this regard; ·  identify, manage and mitigate conflicts of interest; ·  raise the level of harmonisation of administrative sanctions and measures for breach of key provisions of the current Directive; ·  enhance the suitability and objectiveness of advice to consumers; ·  ensure sellers' professional qualifications match the complexity of products sold; ·  simplify and approximate the procedure for cross-border entry to insurance markets across the EU. The proposal differentiates between the different selling channels for insurance products and imposes less burdensome registration and professional qualification requirements on those selling simple insurance products. For example, the sellers of ancillary insurance products of low risk, such as car rentals and travel agents are subject to a simplified declaration procedure instead of registration as insurance intermediaries. The proposal also differentiates between the life insurance products and the general insurance products in respect of the remuneration transparency requirements. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) should play a key role in the implementation of the new EU-wide framework and be granted specific competences in this regard. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to tasks allocated to EIOPA. The total operational expenditure (in commitment appropriations) amounts to EUR 0.844 millions for the period 2014-2016. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Dominica and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 11 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union andDominica on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Dominica when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Dominica to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Dominica may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Dominica remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Dominica reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Dominica to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations on the visa waiver agreement with Trinidad and Tobago and the four other Caribbean countries were opened on 12 November 2014 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 15 December 2014. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Trinidad and Tobago on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Trinidad and Tobago when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Trinidad and Tobago to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that Trinidad and Tobago may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Trinidad and Tobago remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and Trinidad and Tobago reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Trinidad and Tobago to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

A provision has been included in the agreement stating that the United Arab Emirates may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also the United Arab Emirates remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. The Member States and the United Arab Emirates reserve the right to refuse entry into and short stay in their territories if one or more of these conditions are not met. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of the United Arab Emirates to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in North East Atlantic Fisheries to which the European Union is a Contracting Party aims to ensure the long term conservation and optimum utilisation of the fishery resources of the North East Atlantic area, providing sustainable, environmental and social benefits. For the purpose of ensuring the application of this Convention and recommendations adopted by the North East Atlantic Commission (NEAFC), measures concerning control and enforcement relating to fisheries concerned may be adopted. Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 transposes into Union law the Scheme of control and enforcement adopted by the NEAFC. At its Annual Meetings in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015, NEAFC adopted: Recommendation 15:2013 amending the Scheme, concerning the communication of transhipments and of port of landing; Recommendation 9:2014 amending the Scheme, concerning, respectively, the definitions, a number of provisions applying to Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels and the infringement procedures; Recommendation 12:2015 amending Recommendation 9:2014 with respect to Articles 22 and 23 of the Scheme on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels. These Recommendations were adopted with the full support of the EU in NEAFC. It is in the EU's interest therefore that they be introduced in Union law by means of the proposed regulation. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) No 1236/2010 in order to incorporate it into Union law amendments to the Scheme as adopted in NEAFC Recommendations 15/2013 and 9/2014 as amended by Recommendation 12/2015 which have become binding for the Contracting Parties to NEAFC and consequently for the EU. The main change, operated by Recommendation 9/2014, is the alignment of the Scheme with the FAO Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate IUU, approved by the EU in 2011. Contracting Parties have agreed that this recommendation will enter into force on 1 July 2015. The other change, made through Recommendation 15/2013, clarifies that vessels involved in a transhipment operation in the Regulatory Area as receiving vessel shall communicate the port of landing regardless of whether the landing is to take place in a port inside or outside the Convention Area. Recommendation 12/2015 amended Recommendation 9/2014 with respect to notification procedures on Port State Control of foreign fishing vessels with the aim to adapt them for the switch-over from a paper based system to a modern web-based ICT application, operated by the NEAFC Secretary."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. CONTENT: the EU's policy towards the countries of the Western Balkans is defined within the Stabilisation and Association Process launched in May 1999. At its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council concluded that Stabilisation and Association Agreements with Western Balkan countries should be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 introduced exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the Stabilisation and Association process. Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 applies until 31 December 2015. Bosnia and Herzegovina: since the launch of the Stabilisation and Association Process, Stabilisation and Association Agreements have been concluded between the Union and all concerned Western Balkan countries, with the exception of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. Bosnia and Herzegovina was recognised as a potential candidate country for EU accession in 2003 and signed a Stabilisation and Association Agreement in 2008, agreeing to the EU’s conditions for membership. Since then, an Interim Agreement on trade and trade-related matters with Bosnia and Herzegovina applies, pending the finalisation of the ratification process of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Having regard to differences in the scope of the tariff liberalisation under the contractual regimes which have been developed between the Union and all participants to the Stabilisation and Association process and the preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, it is suggested to prolong the duration of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2020, so as to give the beneficiaries of the exceptional trade measures and the European Union sufficient time to align, where appropriate, preferences granted under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 with those provided for under the Stabilisation and Association Agreements. Consequences of the enlargement of the EU to Croatia: Bosnia and Herzegovina have not yet accepted to adapt trade concessions granted under the Interim Agreement in order to take into account the preferential traditional trade between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina under the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA). In case Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union do not find an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions, preferences granted to Bosnia and Herzegovina under Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 should be suspended as of 1 January 2016. Once Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union have signed and applied provisionally an agreement on the adaptation of trade concessions in the Interim Agreement, these preferences will be reestablished. Human Rights : Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 does not provide any possibility to temporarily suspend the grant of exceptional trade measures in case of serious and systematic violations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law by its beneficiaries. It is appropriate to introduce such possibility, so as to ensure that swift action can be taken in case serious and systematic violations of the fundamental principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law would occur in one of the countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process. Wine originating in Montenegro : lastly, a technical adjustment regarding Montenegro's access to the additional global quota for wine imports is included."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Vietnam, based on the November 2004 authorisation for negotiations with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with Vietnam were launched in Hanoi in November 2007. The PCA was signed in Brussels on 27 June 2012. The PCA with Vietnam will supersede the current legal framework of the 1995 Agreement between the European Community and Vietnam and the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which was extended in 1999 to include Vietnam. It is now necessary to approve the PCA on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: the Commission notes that Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines is the subject of Court Case C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul this Decision insofar as the Council had added legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100 TFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4) TFEU). Council Decision No 2012/279/EU on the signature of the PCA Vietnam raises, mutatis mutandis, the same legal issues as Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA Philippines. Court Case C-377/12 is therefore of relevance to the proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA with Vietnam too. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA Vietnam is based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6). The PCA draws the attention of the Council to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The addition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on the outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice, this recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The Commission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure for conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Framework Agreement on Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Viet Nam, of the other part. General principles and political dialogue: the PCA with Vietnam constitutes an important step towards enhanced political and economic involvement of the EU in South-East Asia. Foreign policy: the draft PCA covers the EU’s standard political clauses on: It also addresses legal cooperation, money laundering and terrorist financing, organised crime and corruption, and covers areas of particular interest to Vietnam such as cooperation on human rights and the rule of law, remnants of war and natural disaster prevention. Economic and trade cooperation: the draft PCA provides the basis for more effective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Vietnam in the development, trade and economic fields and will facilitate the conclusion of a Free Trade Agreement with Vietnam. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries. Sectoral cooperation: the PCA strengthens the sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as: Institutional framework: the draft Agreement also includes institutional provisions to put in place a joint committee composed of representatives of the two Parties with the aim of ensuring the correct application of the Agreement and resolving conflicts."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council invited the Commission to consider establishing minimum procedural rights for suspects or accused persons, and to address the issue of presumption of innocence, in order to promote better cooperation in that area. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant proceedings; (ii) a directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings Moreover, on 14 June 2011, the Commission published a Green Paper on the application of EU criminal justice legislation in the field of detention to reflect on ways to strengthen the application of the principle of mutual recognition in the area of detention, within the limits of the EU's competence. The principle of presumption of innocence has been developed over the years. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has held that Article 6(2) of the ECHR encompasses three key requirements: (i) the right not to be publicly presented as convicted by public authorities before the final judgment; (ii) the fact that the burden of proof is on prosecution and that any reasonable doubts on guilt should benefit the accused; and (iii) the right of the accused to be informed of the accusation against him. The right to be present at trial is also an essential right of defence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission’s analysis considers that there exist points in which legal safeguards should be improved with regard to certain aspects the presumption of innocence to strengthen this fundamental right. CONTENT: the draft directive aims to lay down minimum rules concerning certain aspects of the right of suspects and accused persons to be presumed innocent unless proven guilty by a final judgment. The proposal covers the following rights: 1) The right not to be presented guilty by public authorities before the final judgment : the ECtHR established as one of the basic aspects of the principle of presumption of innocence the fact that a court or public official may not publicly present the suspects or accused persons as if they were guilty of an offence if they have not been tried and convicted of it by a final judgment. 2) The burden of proof is on prosecution and any reasonable doubts on the guilt should benefit the accused: this presupposes that a court's judgment must be based on evidence as put before it and not on mere allegations or assumptions. 3) The right not to incriminate one-self and not to cooperate and the right to remain silent: these rights lie at the heart of the notion of a fair trial under Article 6 of the ECHR. ·  the right not to incriminate oneself presupposes that the prosecution in a criminal case seeks to prove the case against the accused without resort to evidence obtained through methods of coercion or oppression; ·  the right to remain silent must be ensured and any inferences drawn from the fact that suspects make use of this right should be excluded. Suspects should be promptly informed of their right to remain silent. Such information should also refer to the content of the right to remain silent and of the consequences of renouncing to it and of invoking it. 4) Right to be present at one's trial : the proposal lays down this right, established by the ECtHR, of an accused to be present at the trial and also establishes limited exceptions to this right, in line with the Charter, the ECHR and EU law. It provides that Member States must ensure that the right to be present applies to any trial aiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and acquittal decisions). Non-regression clause : the proposal aims to ensure that setting common minimum standards does not have the effect of lowering standards in certain Member States and that the standards set in the Charter and in the ECHR are maintained."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment was adopted on 21 December 1989 and became fully applicable as from 1 July 1995. It sets out basic requirements that PPE must comply with in order to be made available on the EU market. The PPE Directive applies to PPE that is defined as “any device or appliance designed to be worn or held by an individual for protection against one or more health and safety hazards”. While the directive has successfully achieved its objectives in creating a single market and ensuring a high level of protection for users of PPE, certain problems have been encountered in its implementation. These concern products on the market that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, diverging approaches of the notified bodies, the effectiveness of the market surveillance as well as risks related to protective equipment which is currently not covered by the PPE Directive. The proposal modifies and clarifies a number of the provisions of the existing Directive and aligns it with the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine Directives to the NLF Decision within an NLF implementation package adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option consists of amending the PPE Directive as it: (i) lead to an improved level of protection of the health and safety of the users; (ii) ensures a more effective work of the market surveillance authorities and consequently reduces the non-compliant products; (iii) does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies. CONTENT: this proposal intends to replace Directive 89/686/EEC on personal protective equipment by a Regulation. Its general objectives are to ensure a high level of protection of human health and safety whilst guaranteeing fair competition for economic operators on the Union market and simplifying the regulatory environment in this area. The proposal also clarifies a number of provisions of the existing Directive and aligns it with those of the Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (decision on the new legislative framework). Scope : the Commission proposes to enlarge the scope of the current PPE Directive by deleting the exclusions of PPE designed and manufactured for private use against heat, damp and water. The proposal keeps the other existing exclusions and clarifies that it does not apply to PPE for head, face or eye protection, subject to the relevant UNECE Regulation, of users of two- or three-wheeled motor vehicles. Two PPE specific definitions have been added in order to clarify the applicable conformity assessment procedures: “Individually adapted PPE” and “Made-to-measure PPE”. Making available on the market, free movement, obligations of economic operators, CE marking : the proposal: contains the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision; obliges the manufacturer of PPE to draw up a technical documentation and to ensure that the PPE is accompanied by a copy of the EU declaration of conformity or a simplified EU declaration of conformity. Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for conformity assessment bodies (notified bodies). It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies with the individual Member State. Categories and Conformity assessment : the proposal simplifies the definition of the categories of PPE. The category only depends on the risk against which the PPE is intended to protect. Provisions are set out for made-to-measure PPE. PPE intended to protect the user against drowning, cuts by hand-held chain-saws, high-pressure cutting, bullet wounds or knife stabs, and harmful noise are subject to the most stringent conformity assessment procedure. Minor amendments have been made which change marginally three essential health and safety requirements (EHSR) in order to remove requirements shown to be impracticable or that create confusion. Application : the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements. However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation. Transitional provisions are foreseen for products manufactured and the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 89/686/EEC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements. DELEGATED ACTS: this proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

Experience from the implementation of Directive 2009/142/EC has shown the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty as regards the definitions relating to its scope, the content of the Member States' communications of their gas types and supply pressures and certain essential requirements. The Commission proposes to replace Directive 2009/142/EC with a Regulation, so as to impose clear and detailed rules which do not give room for divergent transposition by Member States and ensure a uniform implementation throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option of modifying Directive 2009/142/EC was found to be the preferred option because: (i) it is considered more effective since it will be enforceable in law ; (ii) it does not entail significant costs for economic operators and notified bodies; (iii) no significant economic or social impacts could be identified. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation does not change the current scope of Directive 2009/142/EC. However, it modifies some of its provisions in order to clarify and update their content. The proposed Regulation is also aligned to the provisions of Decision No 768/2008/EC establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). · the removal of the outdated temperature limit of 105°C from the definition of the scope; · the introduction of currently missing definitions for the sector specific terminology under Directive 2009/142/EC; · the introduction of a harmonised content and form of the communications of Member States on the types of gas and corresponding supply pressures used on their territory; · the clarification of the relationship between Directive 2009/142/EC and other EU harmonisation legislation, including Ecodesign implementing measures under Directive 2009/125/EC and other Union energy policy instruments; · the improvement of the readability of some of the provisions of Directive 2009/142/EC. The modification also includes the following points: Making available on the market of gas appliances and fittings, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement : the proposal contains the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. The proposed Regulation keeps the existing provision according to which fittings do not bear the CE marking. However, in order to improve clarity, the certificate accompanying fittings under Directive 2009/142/EC has been qualified as “Fitting conformity certificate”, in order to better define its content and clarify its relationship with the EU declaration of conformity requirement under other possibly applicable Union harmonisation legislation. Notified bodies: in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. Conformity assessment: the proposal keeps the conformity assessment procedures provided for under Directive 2009/142/EC. However, it updates the corresponding modules in line with the NLF Decision. In particular, it keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all appliances and fittings. Furthermore, it keeps the current approach for the design phase, according to which the type examination of the product by the notified body takes the form of examination of the complete appliance or fitting. Therefore, in accordance with the NLF Decision, it provides only for the EU-type examination – production type. ENTRY INRO FORCE: the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies, Member States and European Standardisation Bodies, time to adapt to the new requirements. A transitional provision is envisaged for the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2009/142/EC so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2000/9/EC relating to cableway installations designed to carry persons became applicable on 3 May 2002. It sets out essential requirements with which cableway installations, their infrastructure, subsystems and safety components must comply in order to be safe. The main types of cableway installations covered by Directive 2000/9/EC are funiculars, gondolas, detachable chair lifts, fixed-grip chair lifts, aerial tramways, funitels, combined installations (made of several cableway types, such as those of gondolas and chairlifts) and drag lifts. Experience from the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC showed the need to modify some of its provisions in order to clarify and update them and ensure thus legal certainty mainly as regards the: (i) scope, in particular with regard to new types of cableway installations; (ii) lack of an appropriate range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems, which has led to divergent interpretations and implementation of the conformity assessment of subsystems. It is also necessary to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the “goods package” adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008 establishing a common framework for the marketing of products (NLF Decision). The Commission has already proposed the alignment of nine other Directives to the NLF Decision within an “alignment package” adopted on 21 November 2011. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred solution consists of combining two options: (i) amending Directive 2000/9/EC; (ii) providing more extensive guidance on the implementation of Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to its scope and of recommending the application of specific conformity assessment procedures for the assessment of subsystems. CONTENT: the proposal intends to replace Directive 2000/9/EC on cableway installations designed to carry persons by a Regulation. It lays down rules on the design and construction of cableway installations designed to transport persons and on the making available on the market and the free movement of subsystems and safety components for such installations. The proposal intends to align Directive 2000/9/EC to the “goods package” adopted in 2008 and in particular to the NLF Decision EC No 768/2008. Scope : the proposal clarifies and updates the existing scope: in light of the development of new types of cableway installations, it is clarified that the exclusion of cableway installations used for leisure purposes in fairgrounds or amusement parks does not apply to cableway installations that are intended for a dual function, namely of transporting persons and for leisure activities; the exclusion of certain cableway installations intended for agricultural or industrial purposes is maintained, but it clarifies that it also covers cableway installations intended for the service of mountain shelters or huts that are not intended for the transport of the public; the current exclusion of cable-operated ferries is also updated to all cable-operated installations where the users or carriers are water-borne, such as cable-operated water ski installations; the exclusions provided for in Directive 2000/9/EC relating to rack-and-pinion railways and chain-driven installations are not reintroduced. Obligations of economic operators : the proposal contains, with regard to subsystems and safety components, the typical provisions for product-related Union harmonisation legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives, importers and distributors), in accordance with the NLF Decision. Harmonised standards : Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 sets out a horizontal legal framework for European standardisation. Consequently the provisions of Directive 2000/9/EC which cover the same aspects have not been reintroduced in this proposal for reasons of legal certainty. Conformity assessment : the proposal keeps the requirement for a notified body intervention in the design and production phase of all subsystems and safety components. It introduces a range of conformity assessment procedures for subsystems based on the conformity assessment modules of the NLF Decision. In this framework, it also introduces the CE marking for subsystems. Notified bodies : in line with the NLF Decision, the proposal reinforces the notification criteria for notified bodies and introduces specific requirements for notifying authorities. Application : the proposed Regulation will become applicable two years after its entry into force to allow manufacturers, notified bodies and Member States time to adapt to the new requirements. However, the designation of notified bodies pursuant to the new requirements and process needs to start shortly after the entry into force of this Regulation. A transitional provision is foreseen for the certificates issued by notified bodies under Directive 2000/9/EC with regard to subsystems and safety components so as to allow stocks to be absorbed and ensure a smooth transition to the new requirements."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in June 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Kosovo on an EU-only Stabilisation and Association Agreement and adopted negotiating directives. The negotiations resulted in the initialling of the draft text of the agreement on 25 July 2014 which is the subject of this proposal. CONTENT: in this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and of Kosovo, of the other part, on behalf of the European Union, for the parts falling under the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Characteristics of the agreement: the Agreement is based on similar agreement signed with countries in the region, while taking into account that this is an EU-only agreement, as well as Kosovo’s particular situation. Legal basis: a ‘First agreement on principles governing the normalisation of relations’ was reached on 19 April 2013 in the framework of the EU-facilitated dialogue. The Agreement as signed provides for the establishment of an association between the EU and Kosovo involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common actions and special procedure. The decision to conclude this Agreement should therefore be based on the legal basis providing for the establishment of an association allowing the Union to enter into commitments in all areas covered by the Treaties. Main objectives of the Agreement: the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Kosovo provides for wide-ranging cooperation: Overall, the cooperation is underpinned by EU financial and technical assistance, which provides Kosovo with the necessary support and assistance in the implementation of certain aspects of the agreement. Recognition of Kosovo’s international status: it is important to note that the conclusion of the future agreement is without prejudice to Member States' position on the status of Kosovo, which will be decided in accordance with their national practice and international law. None of the terms, wording or definitions used in this proposal and the attached text of the Agreement, nor any recourse to all the necessary legal bases for the conclusion of the Agreement constitute recognition of Kosovo by the Union as an independent State nor does it constitute recognition by individual Member States of Kosovo in that capacity where they have not taken such a step."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council has been substantially amended several times. It is recalled that on 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the December 1992 Edinburgh European Council confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code). The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Main codified provisions : Purpose, scope and application : this Regulation provides for the absence of border control of persons crossing the internal borders between the Member States of the European Union. It lays down rules governing border control of persons crossing the external borders of the Member States of the European Union. In addition, it establishes the list of persons to which it the absence of control to internal borders applies. Border checks should be carried out in such a way as to fully respect human dignity. Border control should be carried out in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued. Types of controls : the Regulation provides that border control comprises not only checks on persons at border crossing points and surveillance between those border crossing points, but also an analysis of the risks for internal security and of the threats that may affect the security of external borders. Therefore, the Regulation sets out the conditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing points and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen Information System (SIS). Since only a verification of fingerprints can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the Schengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provisions have been made for the use at external borders of the Visa Information System (VIS). Exceptional circumstances and controls : the Regulations stipulates that it should be possible to have checks at external borders relaxed in the event of exceptional and unforeseeable circumstances in order to avoid excessive waiting time at border crossing points. The systematic stamping of the documents of third-country nationals remains an obligation in the event of border checks being relaxed. Stamping makes it possible to establish, with certainty, the date on which, and where, the border was crossed. In order to reduce the waiting times of persons enjoying the Union right of free movement, separate lanes, indicated by uniform signs in all Member States, should, where circumstances allow, be provided at border crossing points. Separate lanes should be provided in international airports. Where it is deemed appropriate and if local circumstances so allow, Member States should consider installing separate lanes at sea and land border crossing points. Exceptional reintroduction of controls and serious threats : the reintroduction of internal border control should remain exceptional. In an area without internal border control, it is necessary to have a common response to situations seriously affecting the public policy or internal security of that area, of parts thereof, or of one or more Member States, by allowing for the temporary reintroduction of internal border control in exceptional circumstances, but without jeopardising the principle of the free movement of persons. Given the impact that such measures of last resort may have on all persons having the right to move within the area without internal border control, the conditions and procedures for reintroducing such measures should be provided for, in order to ensure that they are exceptional and that the principle of proportionality is respected. In any case, the reintroduction of internal border control should remain an exception and should only be effected as a measure of last resort, for a strictly limited scope and period of time, based on specific objective criteria and on an assessment of its necessity which should be monitored at Union level. Where a serious threat to public policy or internal security requires immediate action, a Member State should be able to reintroduce border control at its internal borders for a period not exceeding ten days. Any prolongation of that period needs to be monitored at Union level. Conditions for the reintroduction of internal border control : the reintroduction of internal border control might exceptionally be necessary in the case of terrorist incidents or threats, or because of threats posed by organised crime. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders may only be justified under a specific Union-level procedure. The temporary reintroduction of border control at certain internal borders could also be justified in the case of exceptional circumstances and as a measure of last resort where the overall functioning of the area without internal border control is put at risk as a result of persistent serious deficiencies relating to external border control identified in the context of a rigorous evaluation process in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1053/2013."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union is a Party to the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution following its approval in 1981. The Convention is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to limit and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution and its adverse effects upon human health and the environment in the UNECE region. To date, the Convention has been extended by eight Protocols, including the 1998 Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants which aims to control, reduce or eliminate discharges, emissions and losses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Parties present at the 31st session of the Executive Body of the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution adopted by consensus Decisions 2012/5 and 2012/6 amending the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals.

CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the Protocol to the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Heavy Metals. This Protocol aims to reduce and control anthropogenic emissions into the air of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), as harmful heavy metals subject to long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, with a view to further protecting human health and the environment. In this respect, it requires Parties to reduce their total annual emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury below their levels in 1990 (or an alternative year between 1985 and 1995). The amended Protocol sets out, in particular, stricter emission limit values for dust emissions from certain major stationary sources as well as flexible transitional arrangements that shall benefit those Parties that will accede the Protocol, as amended, between 1st January 2014 and 31 December 2019. The amendment to the Protocol is largely covered by current EU law notably via existing emission source control legislation, including above-mentioned Directive 2010/75/EU and the Commission Implementing Decisions adopted in accordance with this Directive and which establish the applicable BAT conclusions for various industrial sectors, such as the manufacture of glass and the production of iron and steel, cement, lime and magnesium oxide and chlor-alkali. This amendment shall be further transposed in particular via a new Directive setting updated national emission ceilings for certain atmopsheric pollutants and providing for annual national emission inventories that shall cover, among others, emissions of lead, cadmium and mercury."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the draft decision notes that undeclared work has serious budgetary implications through decreased tax and social security revenues. It has negative impacts on employment, productivity and working conditions, skills development and life-long learning. It results in lower pension rights and less access to health care and causes unfair competition between undertakings. A closely related phenomenon is falsely declared work, or bogus self-employment, which also has negative consequences in terms of health and safety and social security coverage of the workers concerned. The European Parliament in its resolution of 14 January 2014 called for stronger cooperation and reinforcement of labour inspectorates to fight undeclared work. The main responsibility for tackling undeclared work lies with Member States and relies mostly on three types of enforcement bodies: labour inspectorates, social security inspectorates fighting fraud on social insurance contributions, and tax authorities. In some Member States, social partners, customs authorities, migration bodies, the police and the public prosecutor's office are involved. It has, however, been noticed that, in some cases, cooperation between these different bodies at national level is not as structured or effective as necessary. As the challenges are common to Member States, and as undeclared work often has a cross-border dimension, EU level action can play an important role by reinforcing cooperation between enforcement authorities within and between different Member States in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work. At the moment, there is no formal mechanism in place for all relevant authorities from Member States to address issues related to cross-border aspects of undeclared work. The Communication of 2012 ""Towards a job-rich recovery"" highlighted the need for improved cooperation among Member States and announced the launch of consultations on setting up an EU-level platform between labour inspectorates and other enforcement bodies to combat undeclared work, aimed at improving cooperation, sharing best practices and identifying common principles for inspections. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this included several options for enhancing EU cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work, and concluded that the preferred option would be the establishment of a European Platform with mandatory membership. LEGAL BASIS: Article 153(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft decision establishes a Platform to enhance EU cooperation in the prevention and deterrence of undeclared work, composed of national enforcement authorities as nominated by all the Member States and the Commission. Observers: representatives of the social partners at cross-industry level, as well as from sectors with high incidence of undeclared work may attend meetings of the Platform as observers. Other observers include Eurofound, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the ILO. Objectives : the Platform will contribute to better enforcement of EU and national law, to the reduction of undeclared work and the emergence of formal jobs, by: improving cooperation between Member States' different enforcement authorities at EU level to prevent and deter undeclared work, including bogus self-employment, more efficiently and effectively ; improving Member States' different enforcement authorities' technical capacity to tackle cross-border aspects of undeclared work, increasing public awareness on the urgency of action and encouraging Member States to step up their efforts in dealing with undeclared work. To achieve these objectives, the Platform will: (i) exchange best practices and information, (ii) develop expertise and analysis, (iii) coordinate cross-border operational actions. Tasks: the draft decision sets out a list of tasks that the Platform should carry out for the execution of its mission. These include : establishing a knowledge bank of different practices/measures, including bilateral agreements used in Member States to deter undeclared work ; adopting non-binding guidelines for inspectors, handbooks of good practice and common principles of inspections ; developing permanent training capacity for enforcement authorities and adopting a common framework for carrying out joint trainings ; and organising peer reviews to follow Member States progress, including support for the implementation of country-specific recommendations. Single Pint of Contact : to achieve its objectives, the Platform will be supported by a 'Single point of contact' in each Member State who should have the necessary authority to liaise with national authorities dealing with the multifaceted aspects of undeclared work. Operation : the Commission will coordinate the work of the Platform and chair its meetings. The Platform shall adopt by majority decision, the rules of procedure, a two-year work programme, and the establishment of working groups to examine issues specified in work Programmes. Review: four years after its entry into force, the Commission must submit a report on the application of the decision and assess to what extent the Platform has contributed to the achievement of its objectives. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: Regulation (EU) No 1296/2013 establishes an EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (""EaSI"") for the period 2014-2020. Funding for the Platform will come from the PROGRESS axis. An indicative amount of 2.1 million EUR per year is provided for carrying out the tasks, such as the establishment of practical tools, support by service providers, publishing of common guidelines and principles, and handbooks, developing a permanent training capacity and a common framework for carrying out joint trainings, organising peer reviews and European Campaigns. In addition, grants to finance projects supporting the achievement of the objectives of the Platform will be covered. Up to 224 000 EUR per year will be used to reimburse the costs related to participation in the Platform meetings. It is also recalled that the European Social Fund (ESF) supports Member States' efforts to improve the quality of public administration. Financing is envisaged within the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. The legislative proposal is budget-neutral and does not require additional staff resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU-Moldova Association Agreement was signed on 24 June 2014 and has been provisionally applied from 1 September 2014. This Agreement includes: a bilateral safeguard clause which allows for the temporary suspension of preferences in case their application would result in an unexpected and significant increase of imports causing economic damage to the domestic industry of the importing party. In concrete terms, this instrument makes it possible to either suspend the further tariff liberalization or reintroduce the most favoured nation (MFN) customs duty rate; a so-called anti-circumvention mechanism, which provides for the possibility to reintroduce the MFN customs duty rate when imports of certain agricultural goods from Moldova exceed a given threshold without due justification of their exact origin. The Commission considered it necessary to lay down the procedures to guarantee the effective application of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism. An implementing regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council is necessary to put in place in the EU’s internal legislation the necessary instrument to be able to apply the bilateral safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation constitutes the legal instrument for the implementation of the safeguard clause and the anti-circumvention mechanism of the Agreement already concluded with the Republic of Moldova. Safeguard measures : safeguard measures may be considered only if the product in question is imported into the Union in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to Union production, and under such conditions as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to Union producers of like or directly competing products. The maximum duration of safeguard measures is determined and specific provisions regarding extension and review of such measures are laid down. Initiating an investigation : the tasks of following up and reviewing the Agreement, carrying out investigations and, if necessary, imposing safeguard measures should be carried out in the most transparent manner possible. The Commission should receive information including available evidence from the Member States of any trends in imports which might call for the application of safeguard measures. If there is sufficient prima facie evidence to justify the initiation of proceedings, the Commission should publish a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union. Investigations : the proposal provides that there should be detailed provisions on the initiation of investigations, access to and inspections by interested parties of the information gathered, hearings for the interested parties involved and the opportunities for those parties to submit their views. It also sets time limits for the initiation of an investigation and for determinations as to whether or not safeguard measures are appropriate, with a view to ensuring that such determinations are made quickly, in order to increase legal certainty for the economic operators concerned. An investigation should precede the application of any safeguard measure. Anti-circumvention mechanism : the proposed Regulation provides for the possibility to suspend the preferential customs duties for a maximum period of six months when the imports of certain agricultural products and processed agricultural products reach the annual import volumes defined in the Association Agreement. Implementation : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the adoption of provisional and definitive safeguard measures, for the imposition of prior surveillance measures and for the termination of an investigation without measures provided for in the Agreement, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. The Commission should adopt immediately applicable implementing acts where, in duly justified cases a delay in the imposition of provisional safeguard measures would cause damage which would be difficult to repair or in order to prevent a negative impact on the Union market as a result of an increase in imports."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters seeks to simplify the method of transmission of judicial and extrajudicial documents between the Contracting States. It thus facilitates judicial cooperation in cross-border civil and commercial litigation. The EU in its external relations has been promoting the accession of third countries to the Hague Service Convention. The Hague Service Convention is not open to participation by regional organisations. As a result, the European Union is not in a position to accede to the Convention. Given that the Hague Service Convention is important for the European Union interests, the Council should authorise the Member States which had not concluded the Hague Service Convention before adoption of the Union measures to accede to the Convention in the interest of the European Union, subject to certain conditions. The Member States to which this decision is addressed are Austria and Malta. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 81(2) and 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal for a Council Decision, Austria and Malta would accede to the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters in the interest of the European Union. Purpose of the Convention: the Convention indicates the channels to be used for the transmission from one Contracting State to another in the event of service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial act. The main channel of transmission, in lieu of consular and diplomatic channels, is through a Central Authority, who shall serve the documents or shall arrange to have them served. The Convention also provides for several other modes of transmission (for example, by post). It seeks to establish a system which, as far as possible, brings actual notice of the document to be served to the recipient in sufficient time to enable him to defend himself. Lastly, the Convention facilitates proof that the service has been affected abroad, by means of certificates contained in a uniform model. EU competences: this field falls into the exclusive external competence of the European Union, because of the adoption of internal Union legislation by means of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. As a result, Member States cannot sign this Convention without being authorised to do so. 24 Member States were Parties to the Convention before the EU legislation was adopted. Austria and Malta remain to be authorised to accede to the Convention. The Commission therefore proposes that the Council authorises Austria and Malta to accede to the Convention in the interest of the European Union. The Convention does not contain any provisions allowing the European Union itself to accede to the Convention. Declarations of the Contracting States: the Convention provides for a possibility for the Contracting States to make declarations with regard to a number of its provisions. The EU Member States, Contracting States to the Convention, entered various declarations. The situation is not uniform, however. Against this backdrop, it is not reasonable to require the Member States concerned to make uniform declaration(s), if any. In conclusion, Austria and Malta should, when acceding to the Convention, make all appropriate declarations allowed under its provisions that they deem necessary. The text of such declarations should be attached to the Council decision. Entry into force: Austria and Malta will take the necessary measures to deposit their instruments of accession before 31 December 2014. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implications for the European Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the free movement of workers is a fundamental freedom of Union citizens and one of the pillars of the internal market in the Union enshrined in Article 45 of the TFEU. Article 46 sets out the measures to bring about this freedom, in particular by ensuring close cooperation between the Public Employment Services ('PES'). The free movement of workers is a key element to the development of a more integrated Union labour market which allows worker mobility from high unemployment areas to areas characterised by labour shortages. It also contributes to finding the right skills for vacant positions and overcoming bottlenecks in the labour market. Only approximately 7.5 million of the European labour force of around 241 million (i.e. 3.1%) is economically active in another Member State. At present, high unemployment rates in some Member States coexist with high numbers of open job vacancies in others. There are many reasons why the potential for intra-EU labour mobility remains untapped and individual citizens do not realise their intentions to become mobile workers. The most common practical difficulties expected or encountered are the lack of relevant language knowledge and the difficulties in finding a job. The EU can contribute to addressing the latter by raising awareness on employment opportunities across the Union and developing appropriate support services to encourage intra-EU recruitments. The provisions of Regulation 492/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on freedom of movement for workers within the Union (codification) established mechanisms for clearance and for information exchange and the Commission Implementing Decision 2012/733/EU has laid down provisions on the functioning of a network entitled EURES (European Employment Services) in accordance with that Regulation. Whereas the functioning of the EURES network was subject to some changes at the initiative of the Commission through its 2012 Decision, the Chapter II of Regulation 492/2011 which constitutes the European regulatory framework for the clearance and information exchange between Member States on intra-EU labour mobility has not been amended since 1992. This regulatory framework needs to be revised to reflect new mobility patterns, enhanced requirements for fair mobility, changes in the technology for sharing job vacancy data, the use of a variety of recruitment channels by job seekers and employers and the increasing role of other labour market brokers next to the Public Employment Services ('PES') in the provision of recruitment services. A common framework for cooperation should be established between Member States and the Commission on labour mobility within the Union. This framework should bring together job vacancies from across the Union and the possibility of applying for those job vacancies ('clearance'), define the provision of related support services to workers and employers and provide for a common approach to share information necessary to facilitate said co-operation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives to address shortcomings: Option 1 : no new options, Option 2 : amending Regulation 492/2011 as regards the powers of the Commission on the implementation of its provisions (Lisbonisation), Option 3 : introducing a new Regulation with new provisions altogether (modernisation of EURES) , Option 4 : introducing a new Regulation with a specific Commission mandate to increase the co-operation between public and private employment services. Option 3 is the preferred option which should replace Regulation 492/2011 and the 2012 Decision with a stand-alone instrument combining the provisions of the two instruments. Within this option, a number of specific alternatives were discarded as not being proportionate to the specific objectives. LEGAL BASIS: Article 46 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to enhance access of workers to intra-EU labour mobility support services, thus supporting fair mobility and increasing access to employment opportunities throughout the Union. It replaces the provisions on the exchange of information on job vacancies, job applications and CV’s across Member States (“clearance”) found currently in Regulation 492/2011. It also (re)establishes the European network of Employment Services, called EURES, the purpose of which will be to provide assistance with job search and recruitment across Member States. A similar network is active today on the basis of the 2012 Commission Decision. Therefore, upon adoption of this Regulation, the Commission will repeal the above Decision on the functioning of the current EURES network. In this context, the Commission recently introduced a proposal to establish a network of PES to deepen cooperation and mutual learning. That network will cover a wider range of objectives and initiatives in the form of incentives and is complementary to this proposal. Objectives : the general objective is to make the EURES network an effective instrument for any job seeker or employer interested in intra-EU labour mobility. Shortcomings have been identified in the functioning of the EURES network (such as an incomplete pool of job vacancies and CVs; limited automated matching potential; insufficient support services and cross-border information on labour). The specific objectives of the proposal address these shortcomings: to achieve on the EURES portal a nearly complete supply of job vacancies, with job seekers all over Europe having instant access to the same vacancies, in combination with an extensive pool of CV’s available from which registered employers can recruit; to enable the EURES portal to carry out a good automated matching between job vacancies and CV’s across Member States, translating in all EU languages and understanding skills, competences, qualifications and occupations acquired at national and sectoral level; to make available basic information about the EURES network throughout the Union to any job seeker or employer seeking client services for recruitment and to consistently offer any person interested access to the EURES network; to assist any such person interested with matching, placement and recruitment through the EURES network; to support the functioning of the EURES network through information exchange on national labour shortages and surpluses and the coordination of actions across Member States. More specifically, the proposal seeks to: integrate into a single framework the provisions of chapter II and Article 38 of Regulation 492/2011 and the Commission Decision 733/2012/EU on the EURES network. There may also be a possibility to extend the scope of the EURES network to cover apprenticeships and traineeships; re-establish the EURES network as well as laying down the new terms and conditions as regards its composition and membership. A single governance body to facilitate practical co-operation between Commission and Member States for this Regulation shall be set up; introduce specific measures on transparency and automated matching; introduce the specific measures on mainstreaming and support services. The proposal explicitly supports the extension of the delivery of support services by organisations other than the PES, in principle through the voluntary participation in the EURES network by EURES Partners. In addition, PES are encouraged to develop partnerships to promote a coherent service package to employers as regards intra-EU labour mobility. One specific form of these support structures are cross-border partnerships; reinforce the existing arrangements for sharing information in the EURES network where it benefits the quality of concrete collective outputs or the coordination of policies of Member States. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not result in any specific budgetary impact for the EU budget. Any activities to be carried out by the European Commission for the EURES network which will result in the need for human and/or financial resources fall under the scope of the Regulation establishing the Programme for Employment and Social Innovation (""EaSI"") (2014-2020) and will be covered within the annual budgetary allocation of this programme. For the period 2014-2020, this EU programme will pay for horizontal measures such as the EURES portal, the common training programme, targeted mobility schemes like Your first EURES Job and the development of the European classification for skills/competences, qualifications and occupations (ESCO). For the same period, activities in Member States on intra-EU labour mobility are eligible under the European Social Fund. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current framework for trade relations between the EU and Tunisia is provided by the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, signed in 1995. The Agreement entered into force in 1998 and laid the foundation for the establishment of a Free Trade Area, including a progressive liberalisation on agriculture. Tunisia and the EU are on the verge of engaging in negotiations for establishing a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) that will notably provide for further liberalisation of trade in agriculture. The terrorist attack of 26 June 2015 in Sousse prompted a reaction from the EU on the need to further assist Tunisia in its political and economic transition, in a concrete and targeted manner, through actions that can be effective in the short-term. On 20 July 2015, the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation in Tunisia and concrete measures which the EU could take to support it. It is within this context that the following trade measures are proposed. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to offer a temporary, unilateral duty free tariff rate quota of 35 000 tons annually for Tunisia's exports of olive oil to the Union, under the form of autonomous trade measure. Such quota will be made available for a period of two years, from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2017. This additional volume will be opened once the existing duty free tariff rate quota of 56 700 tonnes, enshrined in the Agreement, is exhausted. Olive oil is Tunisia’s main agricultural export to the EU, and the olive oil industry is an important part of the country’s economy, providing direct and indirect employment to more than one million people and representing one-fifth of the country’s total agricultural employment. Rule of origin : the proposed autonomous trade measures should be subject to compliance by Tunisia with the Union’s relevant rules regarding the origin of products and the procedures related thereto, as well as to Tunisia’s effective administrative cooperation with the Union. Powers shall be conferred on the Commission as regards the respect of the conditions subject to which the preferential arrangements are provided for. Temporary suspension : where the Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence of a failure by Tunisia to comply with the conditions set out in the Regulation, it may adopt an implementing act suspending in whole or in part the preferential arrangements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the measures might lead to a modest net increase on imports as most of the quota increase will probably replace current inward processing trade (about 50 000 tonnes of olive oil a year under the Inward Processing regime), resulting in a reduction of the imports under this regime. The budgetary implications (of duty collections) cannot be quantified precisely at present, but are assumed to be insignificant."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the School Milk Scheme and the School Fruit Scheme have developed independently and in different time periods: the School Milk Scheme has been implemented since 1977, and the School Fruit Scheme came out of a political commitment in the context of the 2007 reform of the Common Market Organisation for fruit and vegetables. The current schemes operate within different legal and financial frameworks, and have some important differences in their design and functioning. The Commission proposes changes to the programmes in order to make them more efficient, and better respond to the overarching problems of declining fruit and vegetable and milk consumption and rising obesity. Furthermore, the Commission made a commitment in the context of the adoption of Council Regulation (EU) No 1370/2013 to review the financing arrangements of the current schemes, namely aid for the distribution of milk as well as the co-financing of the school fruit scheme costs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three options considered, the option chosen is the ""new framework"" scenario that entails a considerable policy change in the form of a common legal and financing framework for the distribution of a restricted number of products, complemented by an orientation towards the long-term objectives through a strengthened educational dimension of the scheme. CONTENT: it is proposed to establish a common legal and financial framework for the distribution of fruit and vegetables and milk to children in schools, supported by strengthened educational measures to reaffirm the link with agriculture, as well as wider issues such as public health and environmental matters. The proposal sets out the key elements of the new scheme. 1) Distribution : it is proposed to focus the distribution of products in schools to two ""core products"": fresh fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and drinking milk only, with the fat content of drinking milk to be decided upon by national health authorities. The distribution will take place within a fixed budget, and will help reverse the declining consumption trends for these two groups of products. 2) Unify the financial provisions and improve financing conditions : in view of the differences between the products and their supply chains, as well as different consumption situation across the Member States, separate ""envelopes"" would be allocated to Member States for fruit and vegetables (including bananas) and milk. The envelope for fruit and vegetables is EUR 150 million and the envelope for milk is EUR 80 million. Certain flexibility is provided for, where Member States can transfer limited shares of their allocations between the envelopes based on their needs. Accordingly, without exceeding the global ceiling of EUR 230 million Member States may transfer up to 15% of their indicative allocations for fruit and vegetables including bananas or for milk to the other sector under conditions to be specified by the Commission by means of delegated acts Within the envelopes, thresholds are established for supporting measures and other eligible measures, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication. Based on experience gained so far, the level of EU contribution towards the price of products is limited through a maximum EU aid per portion for fruit and vegetables and for milk, and not through the EU co-financing levels, as was the case for the School Fruit Scheme. This would be a new element for fruit and vegetables, which would help alleviate the huge disparities in price for products distributed and would imply a simplification in terms of a management. The level of EU subsidy for milk is increased. Member States will be allowed to continue providing national top-ups or attract private funding in order to enlarge the scope and/or the intensity of their intervention of the school schemes. The aid will be allocated to each Member State taking into account certain criteria including (i) the number of six- to ten-year old children as a proportion of the population, (ii) the degree of development of the regions within a Member State so to ensure higher aid to less developed regions and (iii) for milk, the historical use of funds. Reinforce the educational dimension : supporting educational measures will also become a requirement for milk distribution, thus bridging the gap between the current schemes. These measures will have a focus on agricultural issues, nutrition/health (balanced diets) and environmental matters and aim to connect children with food, agricultural production and farmers. Member States could choose thematic educational measures that could occasionally include agricultural products, other than the two core products, such as yoghurts, processed fruit and vegetables, honey, or olive oil. The list of all products supplied under the scheme and their nutritional aspects have to be approved by national health authorities. Supporting educational measures would have to be directly linked to the agricultural objectives of the scheme and be in line with the objective of promoting healthy diets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact of the proposal is budgetary neutral compared to the current situation. For fruit and vegetables , the budgetary ceiling currently set in Regulation No 1308/2013 (EUR 150 million per school year) is maintained in this proposal. For milk , the proposal includes an envelope of EUR 80 million per school year, corresponding to the expected budget execution and in line with the overall amounts for market-related expenditure and direct aids taken into account in the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020. As regards distribution of expenditure, the greatest support will be given to the distribution and supporting educational measures. Other costs, such as evaluation, monitoring and communication, will also be eligible to a more limited extent. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) are designed to measure inflation in a harmonised manner across Member States. The Commission and the European Central Bank use the HICP in their assessment of price stability in Member States under Article 140 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Harmonised consumer price indices are essential for assessing and measuring: (i) convergence in terms of price stability within the EU; and (ii) the results of euro area monetary policy, in terms of achieving the objective of price stability. In October 1995, a Council Regulation on harmonised indices of consumer prices (HICP) was drafted and adopted, followed by 20 implementing regulations in the following 17 years. Certain parameters have changed since the adoption of the original framework: (i) the development of the European Statistical System (ESS); (ii) the technical aspects of data collection and index compilation have changed dramatically due to the rapid rate of technological progress in recent years; (iii) the Lisbon Treaty established a new comitology set-up. These various changes all necessitate redrafting of the legislation on HICP so as to modernise and rationalise the legal basis and adapt it to today’s needs, both actual and potential. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish a common legal framework for the production of harmonised indices by Member States, which involves collecting, compiling, processing and submitting harmonised consumer price indices. The proposal for a revised HICP Regulation seeks to create a single legal measure covering all uniform conditions. It would combine the different implementing regulations into a single one, which would give stakeholders and Member States greater clarity and make administration easier and more effective. This proposal simplifies and clarifies the requirements for the compilation of these indices. It enshrines the principles of the European Statistics Code of Practice relating to commitment to quality, sound methodology, cost-effectiveness, relevance, accuracy, reliability, coherence and comparability. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 1999/32/EC has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 1999/32/EC of 26 April 1999 relating to a reduction in the sulphur content of certain liquid fuels and amending Directive 93/12/EEC. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive seeks to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide resulting from the combustion of certain types of liquid fuels and thereby to reduce the harmful effects of such emissions on man and the environment. This Directive lays down the maximum permitted sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, gas oil, marine gas oil and marine diesel oil used in the Union. With regard to the limit on the sulphur content of heavy fuel oil, the proposal provides for: (i) derogations in Member States and regions where the environmental conditions allow; (ii) derogations for their use in combustion plants which comply with the emission limit values laid down in Directive 2001/80/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, or in Annex V to Directive 2010/75/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. To recall, in 2008, the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) adopted a resolution to amend Annex VI to the Protocol of 1997 to amend the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL), containing regulations for the prevention of air pollution from ships. The revised Annex VI to MARPOL entered into force on 1 July 2010. In order to ensure coherence with international law as well as to secure proper enforcement of new globally established sulphur standards in the Union, the codified Directive should be in line with the revised Annex VI to MARPOL."

The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it ; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Price segmentation between developed country markets and the poorest developing country markets is necessary to ensure that the poorest developing countries are supplied with essential pharmaceutical products at heavily reduced prices. Therefore, those heavily reduced prices cannot be understood as a reference for the price to be paid for the same products in developed country markets. The proposed codified Regulation serves the purpose of preventing tiered priced products from being imported into the Union. Exemptions are laid down for certain situations under the strict provision that it is ensured that the final destination of the products in question is one of the countries listed in Annex II. More specifically, the proposed Regulation lays down: the criteria for establishing what is a tiered priced product; the conditions under which the customs authorities shall take action; the measures which shall be taken by the competent authorities in the Member States."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals setting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and accused persons. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings; (ii) a directive on provisional legal aid for suspects or accused persons deprived of liberty and legal aid in European arrest warrant proceedings. This measure also forms part of the EU Agenda for the Rights of the Child to which the European Parliament, the Council of Europe and UNICEF have contributed. It is presented together with a Commission Recommendation on procedural safeguards for vulnerable persons suspected or accused in criminal proceedings and vulnerable persons subject to European arrest warrant proceedings. By establishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the trust of Member States in the criminal justice systems of other Member States and can thus help improve mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment to support this proposal. CONTENT : the draft directive aims to: ·  establish procedural safeguards to ensure that children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings are able to understand and follow those proceedings; ·  enable such children to exercise their right to a fair trial and to prevent re-offending by children and foster their social integration. The directive will apply to children, meaning persons under the age of 18, subject to criminal proceedings from the time when they become suspected or accused of having committed an offence and until the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. Children will have the following procedural guarantees : Right to information : the child should be informed promptly of the rights under the Directive. In proceedings involving children, the urgency principle should be applied to provide a rapid response and protect the best interests of the child. Right to information of the holder of parental responsibility : further complementary safeguards are provided with regard to the information of the holder of parental responsibility or an appropriate adult in order the take into account the specific needs of children provided that this does not prejudice the due course of the criminal proceedings. Right to an individual assessment : such an individual assessment is needed in order to identify the child's specific needs in terms of protection, education, training and re-integration into society, to determine to what extent he or she would need special measures during criminal proceedings. The individual assessment should be carried out at the latest before the indictment. Right to a lawyer : the directive aims to ensure mandatory access to a lawyer for children who are suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. It also provides that children may not waive this right. However, there are exceptions that include certain minor offences in relation to general municipal regulations and minor public order offences. Right to medical examination : if the child is deprived of liberty, the child should have the right to medical examination upon request by the holder of parental responsibility, the appropriate adult or the child's lawyer. If the medical examination of a child leads to the conclusion that the measures envisaged during the criminal proceedings against the child (e.g. questioning of the child, detention) are incompatible with the general mental and physical condition of the child, the competent authorities should take appropriate measures in accordance with national law. Questioning of children: if a child is deprived of liberty, questioning should always be recorded. Such records must be accessible only to the judicial authorities and the parties of the proceedings to ensure their content and context. Right to liberty : in accordance with United Nation’s rules on the rights of the child, any form of deprivation of liberty of children should be a measure of last resort and be for the shortest appropriate period of time. Taking into account these international standards, this Directive sets minimum rules as regards detention. In order to avoid deprivation of liberty for children, competent authorities should take any alternative measures to deprivation of liberty whenever this is in the best interests of the child. Right to specific treatment in case of deprivation of liberty: children in particular should have the right to: (i) maintain regular and meaningful contact with parents, family and friends; (ii) receive appropriate education, guidance and training; (iii) receive medical care; (iv) be kept separately from adults in order to take into account their vulnerability. Right to protection of privacy: children should be judged in the absence of public. In exceptional cases the court may decide that a hearing is held publicly after it has taken due account of the best interests of the child. In order to ensure proper assistance and support of the child during court hearings, the holder of parental responsibility should be present. Right of children to appear in person at the trial: the right to be present at trial applies to any trial aiming at assessing the question of the guilt of the accused person (both conviction and acquittal decisions). European arrest warrant proceedings : the proposal applies to children subject to proceedings pursuant to Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA from the time they are arrested in the executing State. The competent authorities in executing Member States shall apply the rights set out in the directive, which will promote mutual trust and mutual recognition."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current framework for trade relations between the EU and Tunisia is provided by the Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreement, signed in 1995. The Agreement entered into force in 1998 and laid the foundation for the establishment of a Free Trade Area, including a progressive liberalisation on agriculture. Tunisia and the EU are on the verge of engaging in negotiations for establishing a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) that will notably provide for further liberalisation of trade in agriculture. The terrorist attack of 26 June 2015 in Sousse prompted a reaction from the EU on the need to further assist Tunisia in its political and economic transition, in a concrete and targeted manner, through actions that can be effective in the short-term. On 20 July 2015, the Foreign Affairs Council discussed the situation in Tunisia and concrete measures which the EU could take to support it. It is within this context that the following trade measures are proposed. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to offer a temporary, unilateral duty free tariff rate quota of 35 000 tons annually for Tunisia's exports of olive oil to the Union, under the form of autonomous trade measure. Such quota will be made available for a period of two years, from 1 January 2016 until 31 December 2017. This additional volume will be opened once the existing duty free tariff rate quota of 56 700 tonnes, enshrined in the Agreement, is exhausted. Olive oil is Tunisia’s main agricultural export to the EU, and the olive oil industry is an important part of the country’s economy, providing direct and indirect employment to more than one million people and representing one-fifth of the country’s total agricultural employment. Rule of origin : the proposed autonomous trade measures should be subject to compliance by Tunisia with the Union’s relevant rules regarding the origin of products and the procedures related thereto, as well as to Tunisia’s effective administrative cooperation with the Union. Powers shall be conferred on the Commission as regards the respect of the conditions subject to which the preferential arrangements are provided for. Temporary suspension : where the Commission finds that there is sufficient evidence of a failure by Tunisia to comply with the conditions set out in the Regulation, it may adopt an implementing act suspending in whole or in part the preferential arrangements. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the measures might lead to a modest net increase on imports as most of the quota increase will probably replace current inward processing trade (about 50 000 tonnes of olive oil a year under the Inward Processing regime), resulting in a reduction of the imports under this regime. The budgetary implications (of duty collections) cannot be quantified precisely at present, but are assumed to be insignificant."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in 2001, all the rules on production, marketing, distribution and use were consolidated in a veterinary medicines code (Directive 2001/82/EC); this was followed by Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The current EU legislation on veterinary medicinal products provides the legal environment on authorisation, production, marketing, distribution and use of veterinary medicinal products. It brought some harmonisation to the procedures and rules required to place veterinary medicinal products on the EU market. However, the Commission considers that there is evidence that the existing provisions do not deliver a functioning internal market: diverging or incomplete transposition of the rules and the existence of numerous national requirements imply that companies are confronted with different rules and interpretation in countries and have also led to different levels of public and animal health protection; that needs of the veterinary sector differ substantially from those of the human sector in relation to medicines: in the veterinary sector there are many different animal species, which creates both a fragmented market and the need for major investments in order to extend the authorisation of medicines existing for one animal species to another; the price-setting mechanisms in the veterinary sector follow a completely different logic. Consequently, prices for veterinary medicines are typically substantially lower than for medicinal products for human use; the size of the animal pharmaceutical industry is only a small fraction of the size of the pharmaceutical industry for human medicines. The Commission considers that it is critically important to have a single market for veterinary medicinal products. The current confined and fragmented markets do not allow the pharmaceutical sector to have a positive return on investments for developing new products for certain animal species. The ambition to improve the availability of medicines in the Union and the functioning of the internal market and market competition can only be carried out at EU level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission’s Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the revision of Directive 2001/82/EC and other legislation on veterinary medicinal products seek to put in place, while safeguarding public health, animal health, food safety and the environment, an up-to-date, proportionate body of legislation tailored to the specificities of the veterinary sector. Specific objectives aim to: expand the market beyond the top four animal species, simplify procedures for obtaining a marketing authorisation in multiple national markets, review data requirements in marketing authorisation procedures, simplify post authorisation requirements, review incentives for breakthrough medicines. The proposal also tackles the issue of antimicrobial resistance and introduces provisions to minimise risks to public health arising from the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. The additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council constituted the Union regulatory framework for the manufacture, authorisation and distribution of veterinary medicinal products. In the light of the experience acquired and following the assessment by the Commission of the functioning of the internal market for veterinary medicinal products, the Commission has presented a proposal that will repeal and replace Directive 2001/82/EC on veterinary medicinal products. This proposal lays down procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to take account of the fact that centralised marketing authorisation for veterinary products is being decoupled from that for medicines for humans. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the consultation and a study, An assessment of the impact of the revision of veterinary pharmaceutical legislation, formed the basis of an impact assessment carried out for the Commission between November 2009 and June 2011. The Commission’s Impact Assessment Board (IAB) released its final opinion in September 2013. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 so as to: delete from Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 the provisions regarding granting and maintaining marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products . The rules on marketing authorisations valid in all EU Member States are part of the proposal for a Regulation on veterinary medicinal products. The new Regulation on veterinary medicinal products will cover all routes granting marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products in the Union – both at centralised and national level; establish certain principles applicable to fees payable to the Agency , including the need to take into account, as appropriate, the specific needs for SMEs. The provisions regulating fees should be brought into line with the Treaty of Lisbon; align the powers conferred on the Commission under Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 to Articles 290 and 291 (delegated and implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the costs for the EMA for implementing and applying the new rules are entirely covered by fees charged to industry. Therefore, the proposal is not expected to have any financial impact on the budget of the EU. As set out in the legislative financial statement the additional resource needs for EMA are approximately 8 staff plus expenditure for meetings, translation, IT, etc. The level of fees, their structure and modalities and exceptions will be set at a later stage by the Commission by way of implementing acts. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/20076 has been substantially amended several times. Since further amendments are to be made, that Regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity. A codification of rules that have frequently been amended is also essential if the law is to be clear and transparent. CONTENT: the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1528/2007 of 20 December 2007. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it, fully preserving the content of the acts being codified. At the same time, it is also necessary to make certain substantive amendments to that Regulation in order to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts and to adapt the rules on the exceptional measures with limited territorial application. Therefore, the proposal is being presented in the form of a recast. Purpose of the Regulation : to recall, this Regulation applies the arrangements for products originating in certain states which are part of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States provided for in agreements establishing, or leading to the establishment of, Economic Partnership Agreements. It shall apply to products originating in the regions and states listed in Annex I. It calls for more favourable access to the EU market rules for a number of products defined in the Regulation (notably the elimination of import duties on the Community market if they originate from regions or states listed in Annex I of the Regulation). Such elimination shall be subject to the general safeguards mechanisms. The Regulation also sets the rules for defining the origin of the products from the regions or States concerned. However, these measures are subject to changes under the present proposal. Exceptional measures with limited territorial application : the Commission may, after having examined alternative solutions, authorise the application of surveillance or safeguard measures restricted to the Member State or Member States concerned if it considers that such measures applied at that level are more appropriate than measures applied throughout the Union. Those measures must be strictly limited in time and must disrupt the operation of the internal market as little as possible. Delegated acts : according to the proposal, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of adding an Annex to this Regulation which sets out the regime applicable to products originating in South Africa once the relevant trade provisions of the TDCA have been superseded by the relevant provisions of an agreement establishing, or leading to the establishment of, an Economic Partnership Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of a mandate granted to it by the Council, the European Commission on behalf of the Union negotiated with the Government of Denmark and Government of Greenland in view of renewing the Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and these two territorial entities. Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 20 March 2015. The new Protocol is in line with the objectives of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, strengthens the cooperation between the Union and Greenland and promotes a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Greenlandic fishing zone in the interest of both Parties. CONTENT: with this proposal for a Decision, the Commission proposes the conclusion of a protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community on the one hand, and the Government of Denmark and the Home Rule Government of Greenland, on the other. Period of application: the Fishing Protocol would cover a period of five years from the date of provisional application – i.e. from the date of its signature and from 1 January 2016 at the earliest. Fishing opportunities: the Protocol grants fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the fishing zone of Greenland, in line with relevant conservation and management measures and within the limits of the available surplus. To this effect, the protocol sets an indicative annual level of fishing opportunities granted by Greenland (in tonnes) to Union vessels by species: Following results to be assessed by the ICES Advisory Committee on the ongoing investigations and surveys at sea carried out on the different components of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in Greenland waters and more particularly on spawners located West Greenland inshore, West Greenland offshore and East Greenland offshore, the Joint Committee may revise or adjust the indicative fishing opportunities for cod. Financial contribution: the Protocol provides for a total annual financial contribution of EUR 17.799.978 per year for its duration. This amount corresponds to: The two Parties have agreed to cooperate to implement Greenlandic sectorial fisheries policy and to that end shall continue the policy dialogue on the relevant programming. Specific provisions: provision is made for the setting of principles for responsible fisheries management. Provision is also made for an experimental fisheries programme for species not included in the protocol, as well as scientific cooperation on sustainable fishery exploitation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called “Open Skies” cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council granted the Commission a mandate to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing agreements with an agreement at Union level (the “horizontal mandate”). The objectives of such agreements are to give all European Union air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and to bring bilateral air service agreements between Member States and third countries in line with the law of the Union. In accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ”horizontal mandate”, the Commission has negotiated an agreement with the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: Member States as well as the industry were consulted throughout the negotiations. LEGAL BASIS: Article 100(2), in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and 218 (8) first paragraph of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: in accordance with the standard procedure for the signature and conclusion of international agreements, the Council is asked to approve the decisions on the signature and on the conclusion of the Agreement on certain aspects of air services between the European Union and the Macao Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China and to designate the persons authorised to sign the Agreement on behalf of the Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the breeding of domestic animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species, and to a lesser extent the breeding of animals of other species, occupy an important place in Union agriculture and is a source of income for the agricultural community. The breeding of animals of those species is best encouraged if purebred breeding animals or hybrid breeding pigs of recorded high genetic quality are used. Member States have thus consistently endeavoured, as part of their agricultural policy, to promote, sometimes through public investment, the production of livestock of particular genetic characteristic that meets defined performance standards. Disparities between those standards have the potential to create technical barriers to trade in breeding animals and their germinal products and their imports into the Union. At present Union zootechnical legislation consists of four species specific (vertical) basic acts laying down the fundamental principles, concerning breeding animals of the bovine, porcine, ovine, caprine and equine species. Technical requirements of identical nature for acceptance of breeding animals for breeding are currently regulated in three Council Directives and a Commission Decision. A horizontal Directive, complemented by implementing measures, provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals and their germinal products. Lastly, a specific Council Decision provides rules on the designation of a reference centre for breeding of bovine animals. CONTENT: the proposed regulation provides in a single legal framework the principles relating to: the approval or recognition and listing of breeding organisations, breeders associations and private undertakings, the registration and classification of animals in herd-books, flock-books, studbooks and, in the case of hybrid breeding pigs in registers, performance testing and genetic evaluation, the content and format of zootechnical certificates for breeding animals and their semen, ova and embryos. In addition, the proposal provides rules on imports from third countries of breeding animals, their semen, ova and embryos, and the designation of reference centres for breeding of animals. Provisions are laid down in this Regulation to carry out official controls and zootechnical checks and to resolve disputes arising where zootechnical checks disclose non-compliance with zootechnical requirements. However, the rules hereby proposed mirror those laid down in the Commission proposal for a new Regulation on official controls that is currently discussed in the European Parliament and in the Council. The Commission will closely follow the evolution of the discussions on the two texts, and will make the necessary proposals in due time in order to ensure that the provisions on official controls in the field of zootechnics are included in the forthcoming Regulation on official controls. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Commission adopted, on Tuesday 6 November, a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. This proposal has been subject to in-depth discussions with the Working Groups in the Council and the “Justice and Home Affairs” Council reviewed, in January, July and November 2008, the work carried out on this issue. The discussions enable a consensus to be reached on many of the provisions. Following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the 1 December 2009, the 2007 draft framework proposal, which had not yet been adopted by the Council, became obsolete. This new proposal replaces it and is based on the provisions of the TFEU. It takes into account the views expressed by Member States in Council discussions on the draft Framework decision, as well as the recommendations of the European Parliament as stated in its Resolution of 20 November 2008 and the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Over the last decade the EU and other parts of the world have seen an increase in serious and organised crime, such as trafficking in human beings and drugs. This proposal responds to a request for increased cooperation on organised crime and terrorism. As a response to the threat posed by serious crime and terrorism, and the abolition of internal border controls under the Schengen Convention, the EU adopted measures such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), and the anticipated Entry/Exit System are examples of such measures. The ‘Stockholm Programme’ also calls on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of PNR data to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorism and serious crime. PNR data is unverified information provided by passengers, and collected by and held in the carriers’ reservation and departure control systems for their own commercial purposes. It contains several different types of information, such as travel dates, travel itinerary, ticket information, contact details, the travel agent at which the flight was booked, means of payment used, seat number and baggage information. More systematic collection, use and retention of PNR data with respect to international flights, subject to strict data protection guarantees, would strengthen the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and is necessary to meet those threats to security and reduce the harm they cause. Given that the use of PNR data is not currently regulated at EU level, it is necessary to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal does not require air carriers to collect any additional information from passengers or to retain any data, nor does it require passengers to provide any data in addition to that already being provided to air carriers. In order to ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal is therefore carefully limited in scope and contains strict data protection guarantees. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four main options were examined in the Impact Assessment, each containing two variables: Option A : refraining from addressing the issue at EU level and maintaining the status quo. Option B : addressing the structure of a system for collecting and processing PNR data: with option B.1: Decentralised collection and processing of data by Member States; with option B.2: Centralised collection and processing of data at EU level. Option C : addressing limitation of the purpose of the proposed measures: with option C.1: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime only; with option C.2: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and other policy objectives. Option D : addressing the modes of transport to be covered by the proposed measures: with option D.1: Air carriers only; with option D.2: Air, sea and rail carriers. The options were assessed against the following criteria: security in the EU, protection of personal data, costs to public authorities, costs for carriers/competition in the internal market and encouraging a global approach. The Impact Assessment concluded that a legislative proposal applicable to travel by air with decentralised collection of PNR data for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and other serious crime was the best policy option (combination of B1, C1 and D1). This would enhance security in the EU, while limiting the impact on the protection of personal data to the minimum and keeping costs at an acceptable level. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive contains several chapters which may be summarised as follows: Chapter I - General provisions : t he proposal aims to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Passenger Name Record data as set out in the annex of the proposal include, inter alia: PNR record locator; date of reservation/issue of ticket; date(s) of intended travel; name(s); addresses; billing information; seat numbers; etc. Other general remarks are also made including all available information on unaccompanied minors under 18 years, such as name and gender of the minor, age, name and contact details of guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, name and contact details of guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent). Chapter II - Responsibilities : On Member States :e ach Member State shall set up or designate an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime or a branch of such an authority to act as its ‘Passenger Information Unit’ responsible for collecting PNR data from the air carriers, storing them, analysing them and transmitting the result of the analysis to the competent authorities. The PNR data transferred by the air carriers in relation to international flights which land on or depart from the territory of each Member State shall be collected by the Passenger Information Unit of the relevant Member State. Should the PNR data transferred by air carriers include data beyond those listed in the Annex, the Passenger Information Unit shall delete such data immediately upon receipt. Member States shall ensure that the assessment criteria are set by the Passenger Information Units, in cooperation with the competent authorities. The assessment criteria shall in no circumstances be based on a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. The Passenger Information Unit of a Member State shall transfer the PNR data or the results of the processing of PNR data of the persons identified for the purpose of further examination to the relevant competent authorities of the same Member State. Such transfers shall only be made on a case-by- case basis. Obligations on air carriers :M ember States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that air carriers transfer ('push') the PNR data to the extent that such data are already collected by them, to the database of the national Passenger Information Unit of the Member State on the territory of which the international flight will land or from the territory of which the flight will depart. Air carriers shall transfer PNR data by electronic means using the common protocols and supported data formats to be adopted, or in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means ensuring an appropriate level of data security: (a) 24 to 48 hours before the scheduled time for flight departure; and (b) immediately after flight closure, that is once the passengers have boarded the aircraft in preparation for departure and it is no longer possible for further passengers to board. Member States may permit air carriers to limit the transfer to updates of the transfers. On a case-by-case basis, upon request from a Passenger Information Unit in accordance with national law, air carriers shall transfer PNR data where access earlier than that mentioned is necessary to assist in responding to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or serious crime. Transfer of data to third countries : it is explicitly stated that a Member State may transfer PNR data to a third country under strict and limited conditions and with express authorisation from the Member States for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. Period of data retention : Member States shall ensure that the PNR data provided by the air carriers to the Passenger Information Unit are retained in a database at the Passenger Information Unit for a period of 30 days after their transfer to the Passenger Information Unit of the first Member State on whose territory the international flight is landing or departing. Upon expiry of the period of 30 days after the transfer of the PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the data shall be retained at the Passenger Information Unit for a further period of five years. During this period, all data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate shall be masked out. Access to the full PNR data shall be permitted only by the Head of the Passenger Information Unit for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of a terrorist offence or serious crime, and to provide the competent authorities with the results of such processing; and where it could be reasonably believed that it is necessary to carry out an investigation or prosecution. Penalties against air carriers : penalties are provided for against air carriers which, do not transmit the data required under this Directive, to the extent that they are already collected by the them, or do not do so in the required format or otherwise infringe the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Protection of personal data : the proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Each Member State shall provide that, in respect of all processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive, every passenger shall have the same right to access, the right to rectification, erasure and blocking, the right to compensation and the right to judicial redress as those adopted under national law in implementation of Articles 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. The draft Decision lays down a number of provisions which aim to: prohibit any processing of PNR data revealing a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life; ensure the traceability of all processing of PNR data by air carriers, all transfers of PNR data by Passenger Information Units and all requests by competent authorities or Passenger Information Units of other Member States and third countries; ensure that air carriers, their agents or other ticket sellers for the carriage of passengers on air service inform passengers of international flights at the time of booking a flight and at the time of purchase of a ticket in a clear and precise manner about the provision of PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the purposes of their processing, the period of data retention, their possible use to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime, the possibility of exchanging and sharing such data and their data protection rights, in particular the right to complain to a national data protection supervisory authority of their choice; lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be imposed in case of infringements of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Chapter IV - Implementing measures : this chapter concerns common protocols and supported data formats. All transfers of PNR data by air carriers to the Passenger Information Units for the purposes of this Directive shall be made by electronic means or, in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means, for a period of one year following the adoption of the common protocols and supported data formats. The technical provisions of comitology are also provided to this effect. Chapter V - Final provisions : Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest two years after the entry into force of this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. There will be a transitional period for the proposal in the form of a two year implementation period. There will also be a transitional collection of PNR data, aiming to achieve collection of data on all flights within 6 years from the entry into force of the Directive. The proposal includes a review clause providing for a review of the operation of the Directive four years after its transposition date and a special review of the potential extension of the scope of the Directive to cover PNR data of passengers on flights internal to the EU. Member States shall prepare a set of statistical information on PNR data provided to the Passenger Information Units. Territorial application : the application of the Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols Nos 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Commission adopted, on Tuesday 6 November, a proposal for a Council Framework Decision on the use of Passenger Name Record (PNR) for law enforcement purposes. This proposal has been subject to in-depth discussions with the Working Groups in the Council and the “Justice and Home Affairs” Council reviewed, in January, July and November 2008, the work carried out on this issue. The discussions enable a consensus to be reached on many of the provisions. Following the entry into force of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on the 1 December 2009, the 2007 draft framework proposal, which had not yet been adopted by the Council, became obsolete. This new proposal replaces it and is based on the provisions of the TFEU. It takes into account the views expressed by Member States in Council discussions on the draft Framework decision, as well as the recommendations of the European Parliament as stated in its Resolution of 20 November 2008 and the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor. Over the last decade the EU and other parts of the world have seen an increase in serious and organised crime, such as trafficking in human beings and drugs. This proposal responds to a request for increased cooperation on organised crime and terrorism. As a response to the threat posed by serious crime and terrorism, and the abolition of internal border controls under the Schengen Convention, the EU adopted measures such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the Visa Information System (VIS), and the anticipated Entry/Exit System are examples of such measures. The ‘Stockholm Programme’ also calls on the Commission to present a proposal for the use of PNR data to prevent, detect, investigate and prosecute terrorism and serious crime. PNR data is unverified information provided by passengers, and collected by and held in the carriers’ reservation and departure control systems for their own commercial purposes. It contains several different types of information, such as travel dates, travel itinerary, ticket information, contact details, the travel agent at which the flight was booked, means of payment used, seat number and baggage information. More systematic collection, use and retention of PNR data with respect to international flights, subject to strict data protection guarantees, would strengthen the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and is necessary to meet those threats to security and reduce the harm they cause. Given that the use of PNR data is not currently regulated at EU level, it is necessary to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal does not require air carriers to collect any additional information from passengers or to retain any data, nor does it require passengers to provide any data in addition to that already being provided to air carriers. In order to ensure compliance with the principle of proportionality, the proposal is therefore carefully limited in scope and contains strict data protection guarantees. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four main options were examined in the Impact Assessment, each containing two variables: Option A : refraining from addressing the issue at EU level and maintaining the status quo. Option B : addressing the structure of a system for collecting and processing PNR data: with option B.1: Decentralised collection and processing of data by Member States; with option B.2: Centralised collection and processing of data at EU level. Option C : addressing limitation of the purpose of the proposed measures: with option C.1: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime only; with option C.2: Access for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime and other policy objectives. Option D : addressing the modes of transport to be covered by the proposed measures: with option D.1: Air carriers only; with option D.2: Air, sea and rail carriers. The options were assessed against the following criteria: security in the EU, protection of personal data, costs to public authorities, costs for carriers/competition in the internal market and encouraging a global approach. The Impact Assessment concluded that a legislative proposal applicable to travel by air with decentralised collection of PNR data for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and other serious crime was the best policy option (combination of B1, C1 and D1). This would enhance security in the EU, while limiting the impact on the protection of personal data to the minimum and keeping costs at an acceptable level. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the draft Directive contains several chapters which may be summarised as follows: Chapter I - General provisions : t he proposal aims to harmonise Member States’ provisions on obligations for air carriers, operating flights between a third country and the territory of at least one Member State, to transmit PNR data to the competent authorities for the purpose of preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious crime. The proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. Passenger Name Record data as set out in the annex of the proposal include, inter alia: PNR record locator; date of reservation/issue of ticket; date(s) of intended travel; name(s); addresses; billing information; seat numbers; etc. Other general remarks are also made including all available information on unaccompanied minors under 18 years, such as name and gender of the minor, age, name and contact details of guardian on departure and relationship to the minor, name and contact details of guardian on arrival and relationship to the minor, departure and arrival agent). Chapter II - Responsibilities : On Member States :e ach Member State shall set up or designate an authority competent for the prevention, detection, investigation or prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime or a branch of such an authority to act as its ‘Passenger Information Unit’ responsible for collecting PNR data from the air carriers, storing them, analysing them and transmitting the result of the analysis to the competent authorities. The PNR data transferred by the air carriers in relation to international flights which land on or depart from the territory of each Member State shall be collected by the Passenger Information Unit of the relevant Member State. Should the PNR data transferred by air carriers include data beyond those listed in the Annex, the Passenger Information Unit shall delete such data immediately upon receipt. Member States shall ensure that the assessment criteria are set by the Passenger Information Units, in cooperation with the competent authorities. The assessment criteria shall in no circumstances be based on a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life. The Passenger Information Unit of a Member State shall transfer the PNR data or the results of the processing of PNR data of the persons identified for the purpose of further examination to the relevant competent authorities of the same Member State. Such transfers shall only be made on a case-by- case basis. Obligations on air carriers :M ember States shall adopt the necessary measures to ensure that air carriers transfer ('push') the PNR data to the extent that such data are already collected by them, to the database of the national Passenger Information Unit of the Member State on the territory of which the international flight will land or from the territory of which the flight will depart. Air carriers shall transfer PNR data by electronic means using the common protocols and supported data formats to be adopted, or in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means ensuring an appropriate level of data security: (a) 24 to 48 hours before the scheduled time for flight departure; and (b) immediately after flight closure, that is once the passengers have boarded the aircraft in preparation for departure and it is no longer possible for further passengers to board. Member States may permit air carriers to limit the transfer to updates of the transfers. On a case-by-case basis, upon request from a Passenger Information Unit in accordance with national law, air carriers shall transfer PNR data where access earlier than that mentioned is necessary to assist in responding to a specific and actual threat related to terrorist offences or serious crime. Transfer of data to third countries : it is explicitly stated that a Member State may transfer PNR data to a third country under strict and limited conditions and with express authorisation from the Member States for the purpose of the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. Period of data retention : Member States shall ensure that the PNR data provided by the air carriers to the Passenger Information Unit are retained in a database at the Passenger Information Unit for a period of 30 days after their transfer to the Passenger Information Unit of the first Member State on whose territory the international flight is landing or departing. Upon expiry of the period of 30 days after the transfer of the PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the data shall be retained at the Passenger Information Unit for a further period of five years. During this period, all data elements which could serve to identify the passenger to whom PNR data relate shall be masked out. Access to the full PNR data shall be permitted only by the Head of the Passenger Information Unit for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of a terrorist offence or serious crime, and to provide the competent authorities with the results of such processing; and where it could be reasonably believed that it is necessary to carry out an investigation or prosecution. Penalties against air carriers : penalties are provided for against air carriers which, do not transmit the data required under this Directive, to the extent that they are already collected by the them, or do not do so in the required format or otherwise infringe the national provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Protection of personal data : the proposal is compatible with data protection principles and its provisions are in line with the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA on the protection of personal data processed in the framework of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Each Member State shall provide that, in respect of all processing of personal data pursuant to this Directive, every passenger shall have the same right to access, the right to rectification, erasure and blocking, the right to compensation and the right to judicial redress as those adopted under national law in implementation of Articles 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. The draft Decision lays down a number of provisions which aim to: prohibit any processing of PNR data revealing a person’s race or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical belief, political opinion, trade union membership, health or sexual life; ensure the traceability of all processing of PNR data by air carriers, all transfers of PNR data by Passenger Information Units and all requests by competent authorities or Passenger Information Units of other Member States and third countries; ensure that air carriers, their agents or other ticket sellers for the carriage of passengers on air service inform passengers of international flights at the time of booking a flight and at the time of purchase of a ticket in a clear and precise manner about the provision of PNR data to the Passenger Information Unit, the purposes of their processing, the period of data retention, their possible use to prevent, detect, investigate or prosecute terrorist offences and serious crime, the possibility of exchanging and sharing such data and their data protection rights, in particular the right to complain to a national data protection supervisory authority of their choice; lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties to be imposed in case of infringements of the provisions adopted pursuant to this Directive. Chapter IV - Implementing measures : this chapter concerns common protocols and supported data formats. All transfers of PNR data by air carriers to the Passenger Information Units for the purposes of this Directive shall be made by electronic means or, in the event of technical failure, by any other appropriate means, for a period of one year following the adoption of the common protocols and supported data formats. The technical provisions of comitology are also provided to this effect. Chapter V - Final provisions : Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive at the latest two years after the entry into force of this Directive. They shall forthwith communicate to the Commission the text of those provisions and a correlation table between those provisions and this Directive. There will be a transitional period for the proposal in the form of a two year implementation period. There will also be a transitional collection of PNR data, aiming to achieve collection of data on all flights within 6 years from the entry into force of the Directive. The proposal includes a review clause providing for a review of the operation of the Directive four years after its transposition date and a special review of the potential extension of the scope of the Directive to cover PNR data of passengers on flights internal to the EU. Member States shall prepare a set of statistical information on PNR data provided to the Passenger Information Units. Territorial application : the application of the Directive to the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Protocols Nos 21 and 22 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no implication for the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: although they are not protected as a classical intellectual property rights (IPR), trade secrets are nevertheless a key complementary instrument for the appropriation of intellectual assets that are the drivers of the knowledge economy of the 21st century. Economists agree that companies, irrespective of their size, value trade secrets at least as much as all other forms of IP. Trade secrets are particularly important for SMEs and start-ups as these often lack specialised human resources and financial strength to manage and defend IPRs. Due to globalisation, the exposure of trade secrets to theft, espionage or other misappropriation techniques continues to increase. A survey launched in 2012 revealed that, over the last 10 years, about one in five respondents had suffered at least one attempt at misappropriation within the EU. The risk also increases that stolen trade secrets are used in third countries to produce sub-standard goods that subsequently compete within the EU with those of the victim of the misappropriation. Member States legislation offer an uneven level of protection of trade secrets against their unlawful acquisition, thus leading to fragmentation of the internal market of information and know-how. The Commission considers that harmonisation of trade secret law in the EU would improve conditions for firms to develop, exchange and use innovative knowledge. The Commission adopted in May 2011 a comprehensive IP strategy, undertaking to examine the protection of trade secrets. This proposal is a product of the commitment to create a single market for intellectual property. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option favoured by the Commission to strengthen the efficacy of legal protection for trade secrets involves convergence of national civil law remedies against the misappropriation of trade secrets and rules on preservation of confidentiality of trade secrets during and after legal proceedings. The convergence of civil law remedies would allow innovative businesses to defend their rightful trade secrets more effectively across the EU. CONTENT: the draft directive establishes a definition of trade secret and sets out the means for victims of the misappropriation of such a secret to obtain reparation. The definition of ‘trade secret’ contains three elements: (i) the information must be confidential; (ii) it should have commercial value because of its confidentiality; and (iii) the trade secret holder should have made reasonable efforts to keep it confidential. This definition follows the definition of ‘undisclosed information’ in the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The key element for the acquisition, use and disclosure of a trade secret to be unlawful is the absence of consent of the trade secret holder. The use of a trade secret by a third party is also unlawful, from the moment that third party was aware, should have been aware, or was given notice, of the original unlawful act. Measures, procedures and remedies : the proposal establishes the measures, procedures and remedies that should be made available to the holder of a trade secret in case of unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of that trade secret by a third party. Specifically, the proposal: ·  sets the general principles applicable to the civil enforcement instruments in order to prevent and repress acts of trade secret misappropriation, and safeguards to prevent abusive litigation; ·  establishes a limitation period of at least one year but not more than two years to bring actions for the application of the measures, procedures and remedies provided for in the Directive; ·  requires that Member States provide judicial authorities with mechanisms to preserve the confidentiality of trade secrets disclosed in court for the purpose of litigation, such as restricting access to documents submitted by the parties or third parties. The confidentiality measures must apply during litigation, but also after litigation in case of requests of public access to documents for as long as the information in question remains a trade secret; ·  provides for provisional and precautionary measures in the form of interlocutory injunctions or precautionary seizure of infringing goods; ·  establishes safeguards to ensure equity and proportionality of the provisional and precautionary measures. The proposal also sets out the measures that may be ordered with the decision on the merits of the case: ·  prohibition of use or disclosure of the trade secret, the prohibition to make, offer, place on the market or use infringing goods (or import or store infringing goods for those purposes) and corrective measures; ·  awarding of damages for the prejudice suffered by the trade secret holder and the possibility of calculating the damages on the basis of hypothetical royalties; ·  empowering the competent judicial authorities to adopt publicity measures at the request of the plaintiff, including the publication of the decision on the merits of the case – provided that the trade secret is not disclosed. Sanctions, reporting and final provisions : in order to ensure an effective application of the Directive the proposal provides for the application of sanctions in case of non-compliance with the measures provided for and includes provisions on monitoring and reporting."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the pricing of many financial instruments and financial contracts - such as interest rate swaps, and commercial and non-commercial contracts, such as mortgages - depends on the accuracy and integrity of benchmarks. An index is calculated using a formula or some other methodology on the basis of underlying values. When an index is used as a reference price for a financial instrument or contract it becomes a benchmark. Therefore, it is important to target all benchmarks that price a financial instrument or consumer contract or that measure the performance of investment funds. Cases of manipulation of interest rate benchmarks such as LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) and EURIBOR (Euro Interbank Offered Rate), as well as allegations that energy, oil and foreign exchange benchmarks have been manipulated, have demonstrated that benchmarks whose setting processes share certain characteristics, such as being subject to conflicts of interest, the use of discretion and weak governance, may be vulnerable to manipulation. Failures in, or doubts about, the accuracy and integrity of indices used as benchmarks may undermine market confidence, cause losses to consumers and investors and distort the real economy. It is therefore necessary to ensure the accuracy, robustness and integrity of benchmarks and the benchmark setting process. In most Member States there is currently no regulation at national level on the production of benchmarks. The International Organisation Securities Commissions (IOSCO) recently agreed principles on benchmarks which are to be implemented by its members. However these principles provide flexibility as to the scope and means of their implementation and in relation to certain terms. An EU initiative will help enhance the single market by creating a common framework for reliable and correctly used benchmarks across different Member States. This proposal supplements the proposed Regulation on Market Abuse (MAR) and the proposed Directive for a Criminal Sanctions for Market Abuse (CSMAD) (MAR has been the subject of a political agreement by the European Parliament and the Council in June 2013) clarify that any manipulation of benchmarks is clearly and unequivocally illegal and subject to administrative or criminal sanctions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives. The policy options encompassed options to: (i) limit incentives for manipulation, (ii) minimise discretion and ensure benchmarks are based on sufficient, reliable and representative data, (iii) ensure internal governance and controls address risks, (iv) ensure effective supervision of benchmarks and, (v) enhance transparency and investor protection. LEGAL BASIS: Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to introduce a common framework to ensure the accuracy and integrity of indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts in the Union. The proposal has four main objectives that aim to improve the framework under which benchmarks are provided, contributed to and used: to improve the governance and controls over the benchmark process and in particular ensure that administrators avoid conflicts of interest, or at least manage them adequately; to improve the quality of the input data and methodologies used by benchmark administrators and in particular ensure that sufficient and accurate data is used in the determination of benchmarks. The administrator shall obtain the input data from a reliable and representative panel or sample of contributors so as to ensure that the resultant benchmark is reliable and representative of the market or economic reality that the benchmark is intended to measure (‘Representative contributors’); to ensure that contributors to benchmarks are subject to adequate controls , in particular to avoid conflicts of interest and that their contributions to benchmarks are subject to adequate controls. The integrity and accuracy of benchmarks depends on the integrity and accuracy of the input data provided by contributors. It is essential that the obligations of the contributors in respect of this input data are clearly specified, can be relied on and are consistent with the benchmark administrator’s controls and methodology. It is therefore necessary that the benchmark administrator produces a code of conduct to specify these requirements and that the contributors are bound by that code of conduct; to ensure adequate protection for consumers and investors using benchmarks by enhancing transparency, ensuring adequate rights of redress and ensuring suitability is assessed where necessary. In order for users of benchmarks to make appropriate choices of, and understand the risks of, benchmarks, they need to know what the benchmark measures and their vulnerabilities. Therefore the benchmark administrator should publish a statement specifying these elements as well as publish the input data used to determine the benchmark. The proposed Regulation applies to all published benchmarks that are used to reference a financial instrument traded or admitted to trading on a regulated venue, or a financial contract (such as mortgages) and benchmarks that measure the performance of an investment fund. The proposal exempts from its scope central banks that are members of the European System of Central Banks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the specific budget implications of the proposal relate to task allocated to ESMA. The new tasks will be carried out with the human resources available within the annual budgetary allocation procedure, in the light of budgetary constraints which are applicable to all EU bodies and in line with the financial programming for agencies. In summary, the main budgetary implications of the proposal are: DG MARKT staff : 1 AD staff member (full-time): the total estimated costs are € 0.141 M yearly. ESMA : Staff costs (two temporary agents): the total yearly costs of these 2 temporary agents would be of €0.326 M, towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (€ 0.130 M) and Member States 60% (€ 0.196 M) yearly. Operational and infrastructure costs : an initial expense of € 0.25 M is also estimated for ESMA, towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (€ 0.1 M) and Member States 60% (€ 0.15 M) in 2015. ESMA will also need to produce a report on the application of this Regulation by 1 January 2018 with a total cost of € 0.3 M towards which the Commission would contribute 40% (€ 0.12 M) and Member States 60% (€ 0.18 M) in 2017. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) makes a distinction between: powers which may be delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a particular legislative act, as laid down in Article 290(1) of the TFEU (delegated acts), and the implementing powers which shall be conferred upon the Commission where uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts are needed, as laid down in Article 291(2) of the TFEU (implementing acts). In the context of the alignment of Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council, implementing powers currently conferred upon the Commission by that Regulation should be provided for by conferring powers on the Commission to adopt delegated and/or implementing acts. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to amend Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 so as to align it to the new institutional context. In particular, the aim is to identify the powers conferred upon the Commission and put in place the appropriate procedure for adopting measures on the basis of these powers. It is proposed to: empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts when, for reasons of economic and technical changes, data requirements need to be updated, including submission deadlines and revisions, extensions and eliminations of data flows set out in Annex I, and when the definitions set out in Annex II need to be updated; confer implementing powers upon the Commission, in accordance with the examination procedure laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011, with a view to adopting common quality standards and harmonising the content and periodicity of the quality reports. The European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) shall assist the Commission in exercising its implementing powers in certain statistical domains. These exclude the balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment. In these domains, according to Regulation (EC) No 184/2005, the Balance of Payments Committee (BOP Committee) assists the Commission. The Commission is proposing a new ESS structure to improve coordination and partnership in a clear pyramid structure within the ESS, with the European Statistical System Committee (ESSC) as the highest strategic body. One aspect of this streamlining is to concentrate comitology powers in the hands of the ESSC established by Regulation (EC) No 223/2009, which is regarded as the umbrella committee within the ESS. Therefore, it is also proposed to amend Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 by replacing the references to the BOP committee by a reference to the ESSC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 493(1) and 498(1) of Regulation (EU) nº 575/2013 (‘CRR’) exempt commodity dealers from large exposures requirements and from own funds requirements respectively. Both exemptions expire on 31 December 2017. This 'sunset clause' was originally included in the CRR in order to allow time for regulators to determine a prudential regulation adapted to the risk profile of commodity dealers. To this end, the CRR mandates the Commission to prepare reports by the end of 2015. On the basis of those reports, the Commission may decide to submit proposals to amend the CRR. The prudential framework applicable to investment firms (including commodity dealers) laid down in the CRR and Directive 2013/36/EC (‘the Capital Requirements Directive’) is currently under review. The results will determine the appropriate prudential treatment of commodity dealers. The investment firms review is a complex project. The finalisation of the review and the adoption of new legislation that may be required in light of that review will be concluded only after 31 December 2017. It is therefore highly improbable that any legislation that may result from this review can be prepared, adopted and applied before the current exemptions expire. This has implications for commodity dealers: if no specific prudential framework that may result from the investment firm review would be in place by then, they would be subject to the full CRR/CRD requirements starting from 1 January 2018. This could force them to significantly increase the amount of own funds that they need to have in order to continue their activities and could therefore increase the related costs of performing those activities. To prevent this situation arising, the Commission feels it opportune to extend the existing exemptions laid down in the CRR, while taking into account the amount of time that will be necessary to conclude the investment firms review and to prepare, adopt and apply any legislation that may result from that review. CONTENT: the proposed provisions aim to extend the exemptions laid down in the CRR for commodity dealers from the large exposures and own funds requirements and accordingly, amend Regulation 575/2013. These exemptions apply until 31 December 2020 or the date of entry into force of any amendments, whichever is the earlier."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was signed on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than €10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. This Decision applies to the provisions of the Protocol which do not fall within the scope of Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Freedom, Security and Justice). The Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products. The Protocol provisions fall into different areas of EU activity which may be subdivided as follows: The Protocol: Those articles are complemented by provisions on: (i) record-keeping and security and preventive measures, including anti-money-laundering measures and reporting of suspicious transactions; (ii) sales by Internet; (iii) duty free sales of tobacco products and the obligation to implement effective controls on tobacco and tobacco products in the free zones, including not mixing tobacco products with non-tobacco products at the time of removal from a free zone. Part IV of the Protocol defines the conduct to be established as unlawful under the Parties’ legislation and obliges the Parties to ensure that natural and legal persons are held liable for such unlawful conduct, including criminal offences. Further provisions concern seizure payments, the handling of confiscated tobacco and special investigative techniques. Part V of the Protocol contains provisions for the exchange of relevant information between the Parties, cooperation and mutual assistance (both administrative and legal in relation to criminal matters), jurisdiction and extradition. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission presented a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol, on behalf of the European Union, as regards provisions which fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU."

WP.29 agreed, at its 150th session in March 2010, to establish an informal group with a view to assisting WP.29 in considering actions on the future direction for the harmonisation of vehicle regulations under the Revised 1958 Agreement. This future direction should aim at: On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations within WP.29 for amending the Agreement. At its 164th session in November 2014 WP.29 took note of a proposal submitted by a number of Contracting Parties to the Agreement to increase the voting majority threshold, for the establishment of new UN Regulations and amendments to existing UN Regulations, from the two-thirds to a four-fifths majority. The representative of the EU announced the intention to establish a coordinated position of the EU Member States on this proposal. The proposals for Revision 3 of the Agreement and for increasing the voting majority threshold from two-thirds to four-fifths meet the negotiation objectives specified in the Council Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations within WP.29 for Revision 3 of the Agreement. Therefore, it is proposed to adopt the proposed amendments to the 1958 Agreement and amend it accordingly."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. Currently citizens face different practical problems with asset planning when they are in an international marriage or partnership. The problem is that it is very difficult for people to know which courts have jurisdiction and which laws are applicable to their personal situation and the situation of their property. As a result, they face unintended, and disadvantageous, consequences not only in the daily management of their assets but also when the couple separates or a member of the couple dies. On 16 March 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions in matters of matrimonial property regimes and a proposal for a Council Regulation on jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions regarding the property consequences of registered partnerships. The European Parliament delivered its favourable opinion and comments on the two proposals on 10 September 2013. However, the Council concluded at its meeting of 3 December 2015 that it would not be possible to reach an EU-wide agreement in relation to both regulations within a reasonable period of time. To date, the Commission has received requests from 17 Member States indicating their wish to establish enhanced cooperation: Sweden, Belgium, Greece, Croatia, Slovenia, Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Malta, Luxembourg, Germany, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Austria, Bulgaria and Finland. The Commission concluded that all the legal conditions set by the Treaties for the authorisation of the establishment of enhanced cooperation are fulfilled. It considered that the benefits of establishing enhanced cooperation are numerous compared to the option of keeping the status quo and that the advantages of establishing enhanced cooperation in this area outweigh any possible disadvantage. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision – based on Article 329(1), of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) – seeks to authorise enhanced cooperation between 17 requesting Member States in the area of jurisdiction, applicable law and the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the property regimes of international couples, covering both matters of matrimonial property regimes and the property consequences of registered partnerships. Proposals for specific measures implementing the enhanced cooperation are submitted together with this proposal. According to the Commission, enhanced cooperation would bring citizens the following benefits: Enhanced cooperation shall be open at any time to all Member States, in accordance with Article 328 of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the World Health Assembly adopted in 2003 the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), which aims at reducing tobacco-related deaths and diseases around the world in a comprehensive manner. The EU concluded the FCTC by Council Decision 2004/513/EC. The EU signed the FCTC Protocol on 20 December 2013. Illicit trade in tobacco products and in particular cigarette smuggling into the EU and within the EU is a criminal activity causing huge losses in revenue for the EU and the Member States in terms of unpaid taxes and customs duties. Estimates indicate more than €10 billion losses of revenue annually to the EU and Member States. Most of the EU Member States are affected by the illicit tobacco trade, either as points of entry or transit or destination countries. Since the illicit products mostly originate from countries outside the EU, international cooperation, in particular also based on clear legislative procedures, is key to addressing the problem of illicit trade. The FCTC Protocol currently constitutes the only multilateral regulatory initiative in the area. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is invited to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products to the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The Protocol contains a complex set of measures, rules and policy in the field of fighting illicit trade in tobacco products. This Decision applies to the provisions of the Protocol which fall within the scope of Title V of Part III of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Freedom, Security and Justice). The Protocol contains: The United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark shall not take part in the adoption of the Decision. In parallel to this proposal, the Commission presented a separate proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Protocol, on behalf of the European Union, as regards provisions which do not fall under Title V of Part III of the TFEU."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU (‘MiFID’) together with Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 (‘MiFIR’) was adopted in the wake of the financial crisis. MiFID and MiFIR, collectively referred to as MiFID II, covers securities markets, investment intermediaries and trading venues. The new framework reinforces and replaces the current MiFID framework (Directive 2004/39/EC). Member States need to transpose the Directive by 3 July 2016. Both MiFID and MiFIR are scheduled to apply as of 3 January 2017. During the legislative process, the very high level of complexity of the MiFID II package and the need for a significant number of implementing measures were recognised. To this end, a period of 30 months was foreseen between the adoption and the entry into application, instead of the usual 18-24 months. Despite this unusually long period, ESMA has made clear to the Commission that the technical implementing challenges are of such magnitude that essential data infrastructures will not be in place in time for 3 January 2017. This is a result of significant challenges in collecting the data that is necessary for the operation of the MiFID II rules. The absence of data has ramifications across multiple areas of MIFID II. As regards market regulation, it is clear that without the foundation of reference data (instrument ID) and the additional data infrastructures for transparency calculations and position reporting in place, it will not be possible to apply the majority of the market rules. In order to ensure legal certainty and avoid potential market disruption, urgent action is therefore needed to adjust the date of entry into application for MiFID II CONTENT: the purpose of the draft proposal amending Directive 2014/65/EU is to extend the entry into application of both instruments that are comprised in the MIFID II package as a result of the technical implementation challenges met by the European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA'), national competent authorities ('NCAs') and stakeholders. In order to enable ESMA, NCAs and stakeholders to complete the operational implementation, the Commission considered it appropriate to defer the date by which the Member States need to apply the measures transposing Directive 2014/65/EU and the date by which the repeal of Directive 2004/39/EC is to take effect by 12 months until 3 January 2018. Reports and reviews should be deferred accordingly. The Commission stated that an extension of one year should provide sufficient and reasonable time for ESMA, NCAs and operators to put in place the infrastructure for data collection, reporting and the transparency threshold calculations."

In order to ensure that references in Regulation (EU) 596/2014 to organised trading facilities, small and medium-sized enterprises’ ('SME') growth markets, emission allowances or auctioned products based thereon do not apply until the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU, Article 39(4) of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 stating that references to them are read as references to Directive 2004/39/EC should be adjusted taking into account the extension of the date of application of those acts. In order to ensure that Directive 2004/39/EC is referenced in Regulation (EU) 909/2014 until the extended date of application of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 and Directive 2014/65/EU and that the transitional provisions for MTFs applying for registration as SME growth markets under Regulation (EU) 909/2014 are maintained so as to provide sufficient time for MTFs to apply for such registration under Directive 2014/65/EU, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 909/2014 should be amended."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations with Palau were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters. During further exchanges agreement was reached on all aspects. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 27 May 2015 (Palau) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Palau on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Palau when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Palau may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Palau to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Palau remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Palau to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Colombia. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Colombian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Colombians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru. On 19 May 2015, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations with Colombia were opened on 20 May 2015 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Colombia on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Colombia when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Colombia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Colombia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Colombia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Colombia to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the ""Ministerial Declaration on Trade in Information Technology Products"", known as the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), was concluded by 29 WTO Member States at the Singapore Ministerial Conference in 1996. The ITA entered into force in the European Union in 1997. Today, the ITA counts 82 participants, or half of WTO Members, and covers 97 % of trade in this sector. The ITA requires that each participant eliminates and binds customs duties at zero on a Most Favoured Nation basis for all information technology (IT) products covered. The ITA covers about 200 tariff lines, including computers, telephones, but also inputs, components and machinery for the production of IT goods. The ITA Ministerial Declaration establishes that participants shall meet periodically under the auspices of the Council on Trade in Goods to review the product coverage specified in the Attachments, with a view to agreeing, by consensus, whether in the light of technological developments, experience in applying the tariff concessions, or changes to the HS nomenclature, the Attachments should be modified to incorporate additional products. In May 2012, several countries proposed to expand the product coverage of the ITA. On 24 July 2015, the text of the ""Declaration on the Expansion of Trade on Information Technology Products"" was agreed, with a view to bind and eliminate customs duties on an additional list of 201 IT products. Annual trade in these 201 products is valued at over USD 1.3 trillion per year, and accounts for approximately 10 % of total global trade today. The participants agreed on the staging commitments for each product listed in document G/MA/W/117. The agreement in the form of a Declaration on the Expansion of the ITA (and the schedules containing the staging commitments of the participants) was adopted by the Ministers of the participant countries on 16 December 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: an economic assessment was made by an external company before the negotiations started. With the final results of the negotiations now known, the Commission has made its own in-house assessment, of which the following three elements are the most important findings: CONTENT: under this draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Declaration on the Expansion of Trade in Information Technology Products (ITA), together with the schedules submitted by other participants in the negotiations and which are contained in the WTO document G/MA/W/117. The objective of the ITA expansion is to eliminate duties on IT goods not included in the original ITA. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in total the European Union is expected to lose EUR 1.5 billion in duties on IT goods. However, this loss will be spread out over a total of 7 years. Most low duties will be eliminated at entry into force, representing 25 % of duty value. After 3 years more than 60 % of duty will have been phased out, while 30 % will only be eliminated after 7 years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate individual Framework Agreements on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) with Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. Negotiations with the Philippines started in February 2009 and were concluded in June 2010. Both sides initialled the PCA on 25 June 2010. The PCA was signed in Phnom Penh on 11 July 2012, on the occasion of the ASEAN Regional Forum ministerial meeting. The PCA with the Philippines is the first-ever bilateral agreement with the Philippines and supersedes the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN). It is now necessary to approve the Framework-Agreement on behalf of the European Union. LEGAL BASIS: the Commission notes that Council Decision No 2012/272/EU on the signature of the PCA with the Philippines is the subject of Court Case C-377/12: the Commission asked the Court to annul the above-mentioned Decision insofar as the Council had added the legal bases relating to transport (Articles 91 and 100 TFEU), readmission (Article 79(3) TFEU) and the environment (Article 191(4) TFEU). The Commission asked the Court to maintain the effects of the contested decision. Subject to the Court ruling in Case-377/12, this proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the PCA is based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6). The Framework Agreement draws the attention of the Council to the recital in the Agreement relating to the specific position of the UK, Ireland and Denmark based on Protocols 21 and 22 of the Treaties. The addition of this recital is due to the genesis of this text only. Depending on the outcome of case C-377/12, currently pending before the Court of Justice, this recital may have to be dropped or reworded at a later stage. The Commission takes the view that, as long as this case is pending, the procedure for conclusion of this Agreement cannot be finalised. CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Philippines, of the other part. General principles and political dialogue: the PCA with the Philippines marks an important step towards strengthening bilateral relations and the EU’s role in South-East Asia, based on shared universal values such as democracy and human rights. It paves the way for enhanced political, regional and global cooperation. Foreign policy: the PCA contains commitments which are central to the EU’s foreign policy, including provisions on: It also includes areas of current interest such as the peace process and disaster risk management. Economic and trade cooperation: the PCA considerably broadens the scope for mutual engagement in the economic and trade domain. It has an important trade cooperation section, which should facilitate free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations. The conclusion of the PCA is in line with the EU's objective of creating a comprehensive and coherent economic and political framework for relations between the EU and ASEAN countries. Additionally, the PCA has an important development component, including strict provisions on protecting the EU’s financial interests. Sectoral cooperation: the PCA strengthens the sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, such as: Institutional Framework: the draft Agreement also includes institutional provisions to put in place a joint committee composed of representatives of the two Parties with the aim of ensuring the correct application of the Agreement and resolving conflicts."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Tunisia was the first Mediterranean country to sign an Association Agreement with the EU on 17 July 1995, which came into force on 1 March 1998. Tunisia is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. In parallel to this political transition process, the Tunisian economy has suffered from continuous domestic unrest, regional instability (including the impact of the Libyan conflicts) and a weak international environment (particularly in the Union, Tunisia’s main trading partner). These unfavourable developments substantially weakened its growth performance, as well as its fiscal and balance of payments positions. Since 2011, the Union has expressed its unequivocal commitment to supporting Tunisia in its economic and political reform process. It has increased its financial support to Tunisia, strengthening its cooperation in many fields, including the civil society the electoral system, security, regional development and social and economic reforms. And it has offered the possibility of concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area agreement, the negotiations of which were launched in October 2014. Tunisia reached in mid-April 2013 an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a 24-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 1.75 billion, which was approved by the IMF Board on June 2013, and which was subsequently extended until December 2015. It also requested in August 2013 complementary Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) from the EU. In response, the European Commission proposed a MFA of EUR 250 million in December 2013 in the form of loans (MFA-I), which the co-legislators raised to EUR 300 million and approved in May 2014 (Decision No 534/2014/EU). This amount is being successfully implemented. Following the completion of the 6th review of the IMF programme last September, Tunisia requested a successor arrangement with the IMF, probably of a 4-year duration. The new IMF programme is still under negotiation but expected to be sent for IMF Board approval in the spring of 2016. In 2015, the Tunisia's economy has been significantly affected by several terrorist attacks that have targeted key economic industries like tourism and transport as well as aiming to disrupt the consolidation of its political transition. In this context, Tunisia requested a second MFA operation from the EU in the amount of EUR 500 million, which would accompany the successor IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Tunisia for a total maximum amount of EUR 500 million, provided in the form of a medium term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Tunisia's residual external financing needs in 2016-17, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance, to be disbursed in three instalments (EUR 200 million, EUR 150 million and EUR 150 million, respectively), should help the country overcome its difficult economic and balance of payments situation it is experiencing, which has been exacerbated by the terrorist attacks it suffered in 2015 and by persistent domestic and regional unrest. It will also promote structural reforms aimed at raising sustainable economic growth and improving public finance management. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. The disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable. The Commission will target structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth (e.g. targeting the transparency and efficiency of public finance management; fiscal reforms; reforms to strengthen the social safety net; labour market reforms; and reforms to improve the regulatory framework for trade and investment). In addition, the Commission and the Tunisian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (""the provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first and second loan disbursements will be made in 2016 for a total amount of EUR 350 million and the third loan disbursement in 2017 for the amount of EUR 150 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-2019 budgets. The implications on expenditure (including human resources and administrative costs) are estimated at EUR 45.295 million for 2016-2019."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 48 of Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, as amended by a Regulation (EU, Euratom) of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Protocol No 3 on the Statute of the Court of Justice, provides that the General Court, consisting of 40 Judges as from the date of entry into force of the amending Regulation, will consist of 47 Judges as from 1 September 2016, and of two Judges per Member State as from 1 September 2019. Increasing by seven the number of Judges of the General Court on 1 September 2016 will also require jurisdiction at first instance in disputes between the Union and its servants to be transferred to the General Court, which presupposes, the dissolution of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal (CST). CONTENT: the draft Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council set out below is based on Article 256(1) TFEU, the first and second paragraphs of Article 257 TFEU, the second paragraph of Article 281 TFEU, and Article 106a(1) EAEC. The proposed text: 1) repeals Council Decision 2004/752/EC, Euratom establishing the European Union Civil Service Tribunal and, in consequence thereof, Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 979/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to temporary Judges of the European Union Civil Service Tribunal; 2) introduces two new Articles into the Statute of the Court seeking to: set out that the General Court shall exercise at first instance jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and its servants, including disputes between all institutions and all bodies, offices or agencies, on the one hand, and their servants, on the other, in respect of which jurisdiction is conferred on the Court of Justice of the European Union; enable the court responsible for civil service disputes to examine, at all stages of the procedure, the possibilities of amicable settlement of disputes. A new Article provides, in general terms, that the provisions relating to the jurisdiction, composition, organisation and procedure of any specialised court established under Article 257 TFEU are to be contained in an Annex to the Statute. 3) governs the procedure for dealing with cases pending before the Civil Service Tribunal (‘CST’) on 31 August 2016 , which are to be transferred, on 1 September 2016, to the General Court. The General Court should continue dealing with those cases as it finds them at that date, the procedural steps taken by the CST in those cases remaining applicable. In the event of a case being transferred to the General Court after the hearing, the oral part of the procedure would be reopened; 4) lays down a transitional regime in respect of appeals under examination when jurisdiction is transferred on 1 September 2016, or brought after that date, against decisions of the CST. The General Court is to continue to have jurisdiction to hear and determine such appeals. Accordingly, Articles 9 to 12 of Annex I to the Statute of the Court must remain applicable to the proceedings concerned. If the General Court sets aside a decision of the CST but considers that the state of the proceedings does not permit a decision, it is to refer the case to a chamber other than that which ruled on the appeal (that is to say, the Appeal Chamber). Lastly, the proposal sets the date on which the transfer of jurisdiction to the General Court to rule at first instance on disputes between the Union and its servants is to take effect as 1 September 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to it. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening up of certain European Union programmes and agencies to ENP partner countries is one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union’s neighbourhood. The Commission has expanded on this in its Communication “on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes”. The Council endorsed this approach in conclusions on 5 March 2007. The Council, on 18 June 2007, issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. To date, Protocols have been signed with Armenia, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Moldova, Morocco and Ukraine. In December 2013, Lebanon expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the Protocol negotiated with Lebanon is attached and the subject of this proposal. It is now appropriate for the European Union to conclude the protocol.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of the Common Fisheries Policy, as set out in Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 is to ensure exploitation of living aquatic resources that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions. The Union is Party to the ICCAT, the Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjoining seas to which the Union is a Contracting Party. The ICCAT has the authority to adopt decisions (“recommendations”) for fisheries conservation and management in its area of competence; these acts are binding. Certain ICCAT BFT measures were transposed through Regulation (EU) No 544/2014 which amended Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009. The purpose of that amendment was to transpose the measures on fishing seasons adopted by ICCAT in 2012 and 2013. With a view to ensure uniform and effective application throughout the European Union of all measures of the Recovery plan adopted between 2012 and 2014, the current proposal will incorporate them into a Regulation concerning a multiannual recovery plan for BFT in the eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean. This Regulation will repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 302/2009. CONTENT: the objective of the proposed Regulation, in line with the Recovery plan, is to achieve a biomass corresponding to the maximum sustainable yield by 2022 with at least 60% probability. The proposal aims at transposing into Union law measures of the multiannual Bluefin Tuna (BFT) recovery plan in the Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean adopted by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) at its annual meetings between 2012 and 2014. It contains technical measures such as those on transfer and caging operations of live BFT, including also measures on the use of stereoscopic cameras to estimate the quantities of BFT and releases, catch reporting requirements, and the implementation of the ICCAT Regional Observer Programme. The new Regulation on the CFP introduced a landing obligation which applies as of 1 January 2015 to Bluefin tuna. Under that Regulation, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts, for the purpose of implementing such international obligations into Union law, including, in particular, derogations from the landing obligation. Accordingly, the discard of bluefin tuna will be allowed in some situations laid down in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2015/98. This Regulation does therefore not need to cover such discard obligations. DELEGATED ACT: the proposal contains provisions to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at the World Summit on Sustainable Development at Johannesburg in 2002, the Union and its Member States committed themselves to act against the continued decline of many fish stocks. Cod, herring and sprat are the subject of important fisheries in the Baltic Sea. They are also important components of the Baltic ecosystem and there are also strong biological interactions between them. Scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea ('ICES') has indicated that the current exploitation rates for some of these stocks are not consistent with achieving maximum sustainable yield. A management plan for the Baltic Sea cod stocks has been in place since 2007 but the stocks of herring and sprat are not yet subject to a management plan. This hinders the sustainable management of these fisheries, and does not provide stability of fishing opportunities for the fishermen operating in these fisheries. In addition, Member States and stakeholders have expressed support for the development and implementation of management plans for the key Baltic stocks. In order to increase predictability for fishermen and to ensure high, stable and sustainable catches , the proposal is the first multiannual plan adopted in accordance with the new Common Fisheries Policy which entered into force in January 2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three options were analysed from biological, environmental and economic-social aspects. The option with most beneficial impact has been then developed into the present multiannual plan: to ensure sustainable fisheries at MSY level by 2015 for the stocks concerned is to achieve biological and environmental benefits. The probable reduction in the overall amount of fishing would also imply a reduction in emissions from vessel engines; as for the economic-social impact , bringing the herring and sprat stocks under a management plan would provide a systematic basis for setting annual TACs in a way which would provide the pelagic sector with predictability of catches which would help support business planning and stability of supply; the abolishment of fishing effort system and of requirement of single area fishing will simplify the legal framework and reduce administrative burden on Member State and industry. CONTENT: the Commission proposes, in the framework of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), a multiannual fisheries management plan for the Baltic Sea that applies to cod, herring and sprat stocks. This plan replaces the management plan in place for the two Baltic cod stocks. The plan will ensure the sustainable exploitation of these Baltic Sea stocks, and provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on interactions within and between the stocks and with other aspects of the ecosystem and environment. In accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources, the main elements of the plan are: objectives and targets (Achieve levels of fishing mortality consistent with the principle of maximum sustainable yield); conservation reference points expressed in spawning biomass levels and specific conservation measures; provisions related to the landing obligation; framework of technical measures; periodic evaluation of the plan based on scientific advice. The plan does not include annual limits on fishing effort. It establishes regional cooperation in respect of adopting technical measures, provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for the by catches in the fisheries for the stocks concerned. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to Annex II, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. Those 19 countries are: Colombia, Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Peru, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. Colombia and Peru were, according to Recital 5 of Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the Commission could present to the Council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. In October 2014, the Commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of Peru. The Commission concluded that the significant improvement of the Peruvian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that Peruvians should be granted visa-free access to the Member States' territory. In addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the Union. In March 2015, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with Colombia and Peru. On 19 May 2015, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations with Peru were opened on 20 May 2015 in Brussels. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 June 2015. The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Peru on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Peru when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Peru may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Peru to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Peru remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Biometric passports: the Agreement includes a number of declarations: Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Peru to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the emissions limits for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) are currently set out in Directive 97/68/EC. This Directive was amended a number of times, but several technical reviews have concluded that the legislation in its current form has shortcomings. Non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) covers a large variety of combustion engines installed in machines ranging from small handheld equipment, construction machinery and generating sets, to railcars, locomotives and inland waterway vessels. These engines contribute significantly to air pollution and are accountable for roughly 15% of the nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 5% of the particulate matter (PM) emissions in the EU. The proposal also ties in with the industrial policy update of 2012 and could make an important contribution to technical harmonisation in the context of the EU-US trade negotiations (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - TTIP). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment took into account in the analytical design that the preferred choice might be a combination of elements from different options. Alongside the no-policy change scenario, these options are: alignment with US standards in scope and limit values. step towards road sector ambition levels, for the most relevant emission sources. extended level of ambition through enhanced monitoring provisions. CONTENT: the proposal significantly upgrades the NRMM engine type-approval system with respect to the technical requirements on emissions by adopting stricter levels, as well as introducing the “split-level approach” which is already used in other pieces of legislation in the area of EU type-approval of motor vehicles. This approach foresees legislation in two steps: first, the fundamental provisions will be laid down by the European Parliament and the Council in a Regulation based on the ordinary legislative procedure; secondly, the technical specifications implementing the fundamental provisions will be laid down in delegated acts adopted by the Commission in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU. The draft proposal and its implementing and delegated acts will carry over and improve on the existing requirements laid down in Directive 97/68/EC. Compared to the existing act, the proposal for a regulation will: introduce new emission limits reflecting technological progress and EU policies in the on-road sector, with a view to achieving EU air quality targets; extend the scope , with a view to improving market harmonisation (EU and international) and minimising the risk of market distortions; introduce measures for simplifying administrative procedures and improving enforcement, including conditions for better market surveillance. In particular, the delegated acts adopted under this proposal will include, amongst others: detailed technical requirements of the test cycles; technical test and measurement procedures; detailed arrangements and requirements for the exceptions granted under this Regulation; detailed provisions for type-approval procedures. The proposal also provides general and specific transitional periods in order to allow sufficient lead time for engine and machinery manufacturers, as well as for administrations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the cost associated to setting up an electronic database for the exchange of type-approval information was already assessed in a feasibility study commissioned by the UNECE in June 2006. The study predicted one off start-up costs in the EUR 50 000 to EUR 150 000 range and operating costs of EUR 5 000 to EUR 15 000 per month, depending on the length of the contract with the service provider. A similar monthly range is provided for operating a help desk service, if required. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: energy labelling enables customers to obtain accurate, relevant and comparable information on the energy efficiency and consumption of energy related products wherever they are in the Union allowing them to take informed cost-effective and environmentally friendly purchasing decisions that are both good for the environment and save money. On 25 February 2015, the Commission announced in its Framework Strategy for a Resilient Energy Union a review of Directive 2010/30/EU on the Energy Labelling Directive in order to further exploit the potential of energy efficiency for the moderation of energy demand and consequent reduction of the energy dependency of the European Union. Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council was evaluated for its effectiveness. The evaluation identified the need to update the Energy Labelling framework to improve its effectiveness. For 2030 the European Council set in October 2014 an indicative target at EU level of at least 27% for improving energy efficiency which will be reviewed by 2020, having in mind an EU level of 30%. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment looks at both a number of issues with the current Directive and some specific items concerning the Ecodesign Directive. The two most important issues concerning the Energy Labelling Directive were: reduced effectiveness of the energy label and non-compliance due to weak enforcement; long rulemaking processes, leading to outdated technical and preparatory work. The final option chosen was to: (i) improve the existing regulatory framework on energy labelling, (ii) require labelled products to be registered in a new database,(iii) improve the legal structure by changing the current Energy Labelling Directive to a Regulation, to align it with the market surveillance regulation, and to, (iv) fund EU joint market surveillance actions. CONTENT: this proposal follows up on the Energy Union Framework Strategy and intends to replace Directive 2010/30/EU on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products by a Regulation. In the proposal, the objectives and main principles of the current Energy Labelling Directive are retained but the proposal clarifies, strengthens and extends the scope of the current Directive's provisions by: (1) Updating the label and allowing for rescaling : the success of energy labelling means that the label is running into its limits. Although A+ to A+++ energy efficiency classes were added in 2010, for some product groups, all models are already in those new classes and there are no longer any models in the lower classes. There is a systematic need to 'rescale' products and to go back to the original A to G energy label scale, which studies suggest is the one best understood by consumers. Although the current Directive allows for the possible reclassification of products through specific delegated acts, the current proposal deals with the need to rescale the energy labels in a much more systematic manner. It also makes clear the obligations on suppliers and dealers during the rescaling and replacement phase. The existing labels will be reviewed by the Commission within five years of the entry into force of the Regulation, with a view to rescaling them. The delegated act would contain a specific date by which the 'old' labels would have to be replaced with the rescaled label (the ""replacement date""). During a transitional period, dealers would be required to replace the old label with the new one on all products on display in shops . They would have one week to replace all labels with the new ones. Member States would be required to run promotional information campaigns to inform consumers of the rescaling exercise. (2) Creating a database of products covered by energy labelling obligations : overall non-compliance in the market is estimated at 20%, leading to some 10% of envisaged energy savings being lost. The new product registration database: (i) will allow market surveillance authorities much quicker access to the necessary information; (ii) will provide up-to-date market data and energy efficiency information which will accelerate the preparatory/review studies and subsequent regulatory process. The proposal also updates the Directive's requirements in terms of providing for electronic supply of labels or for suppliers to make them available on their websites. The administrative burden for registering products is estimated at EUR 1.5 million per year for the entire industry; about 0.5 eurocent per product sold. (3) Making clearer the obligations of the various parties: the proposal regroups the respective obligations on Member States, suppliers and dealers in order to make these more coherent and simpler. The replacement of the Directive with a Regulation means less administrative burden for Member States and directly applicable requirements for suppliers and dealers which will ensure a complete harmonisation across the EU. (4) Improving the link between energy labelling and measurement standards : the proposal makes clear that a product which complies with the measurement and calculation methods set out in the relevant harmonised standard will be presumed to comply with the relevant provisions of the applicable delegated act. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this initiative does not require additional EU budgetary resources. The costs concern: setting up a products database (1.500.000 EUR in 2016 and 150.000 EUR yearly maintenance cost in subsequent years); consumer understanding studies for labels for specific product groups (300.000 EUR per year from 2017). These are financed through reprioritisation of existing budget for the implementation of the policy on energy efficiency of products. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during 2015, the European Union witnessed extraordinary pressures at its external borders with an estimated 1.5 million persons having crossed the borders illegally between January and November. The significant secondary movements have led several Member States to reintroduce border control at their internal borders. This has put considerable strain on the functioning and coherence of the Schengen area. Throughout the current migration crisis, it became clear that the Schengen area without internal borders is only sustainable if the external borders are effectively secured and protected. A chain is always only as strong as its weakest link. A decisive step towards an integrated management system for external borders therefore is needed. This is only possible as a shared task among all Member States, in line with the principles of solidarity and responsibility to which all the EU’s institutions have agreed as the guiding principles addressing the migration crisis The objective of this draft Regulation is to provide for a more integrated management of the EU’s external borders, inter alia by providing the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences to prevent that deficiencies of external border management or unpredicted migratory flows undermine the proper functioning of the Schengen area. It responds to the calls of the European Parliament and the European Council to effectively manage the external borders of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposed Regulation is part of a package of measures presented by the Commission in order to better ensure the protection of the EU’s external borders. It establishes a European Border and Coast Guard and a European Border and Coast Guard Agency built from Frontex. It seeks to provide the European Border and Coast Guard Agency with more competences in the fields of external border management and return than Frontex currently has. This proposal sets outs out the following elements reinforcing the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, as compared to that of Frontex: a monitoring and supervisory role and liaison officers : a monitoring and risk analysis centre will be established to monitor migratory flows towards and within the European Union and to carry out risk analysis and mandatory vulnerability assessments to identify and address weak spots. Liaison officers of the Agency to be deployed to Member States so that the Agency can ensure proper and effective monitoring not only through risk analysis, information exchange and Eurosur, but also through its presence on the ground. The task of the liaison officer is to foster cooperation between the Agency and the Member States and in particular, to support the collection of information required by the Agency for carrying out the vulnerability assessment and to monitor the measures taken by Member States at the external borders; evaluation of needs : supervisory role for the Agency by establishing a mandatory vulnerability assessment by the Agency to assess the capacity of Member States to face challenges at their external borders, including by means of an assessment of the equipment and resources of Member States as well as of their contingency planning. The Executive Director, on the advice of a Supervisory Board created within the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, will identify the measures that need to be taken by the Member State concerned and should set a time-limit within which those measures need to be taken. The decision of the Executive Director will be binding on the Member State concerned, and where the necessary measures are not taken within the set time-limit, the matter will be referred to the Management Board for a further decision. If the Member State would still fail to act, thereby risking putting in jeopardy the functioning of the Schengen area, the Commission may adopt an implementing decision for direct intervention by the Agency; urgent joint action : enhanced tasks for the Agency consisting of the setting up and deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams for joint operations and rapid border interventions, the setting up of a technical equipment pool, assisting the Commission in coordinating the activities of the migration management support teams at hotspot areas, and a strengthened role in return, risk analysis, training and research; a rapid reserve pool of border guards: mandatory pooling of human resources by establishing a rapid reserve pool which will be a standing corps composed of a small percentage of the total number of border guards in the Member States on a yearly basis. The deployment of European Border and Coast Guard Teams from the rapid reserve pool should be immediately complemented by additional European Border and Coast Guard Teams as appropriate. The rapid reserve pool shall be a standing corps placed at the immediate disposal of the Agency and which can be deployed from each Member State within three working days from when the operational plan is agreed upon by the Executive Director and the host Member State. For that purpose, each Member State shall, on a yearly basis, make available to the Agency a number of border guards commensurate to at least 3% of the staff of Member States without land or sea external borders and 2% of the staff of Member States with land or sea external borders, and which shall amount to a minimum of 1 500 border guards, corresponding to the profiles identified by the decision of the Management Board; return office : there will be a stronger role for the Agency on return by establishing a Return Office within the Agency to allow for the deployment of European Return Intervention Teams composed of escorts, monitors and return specialists who will work to effectively return illegally staying third country nationals. A standard European travel document for return will ensure a wider acceptance of returnees by third countries. The Agency will coordinate and organise return operations and return interventions from one or more Member States, and promote their organisation on its own initiative to reinforce the return system of the Member States which are subject to particular pressure; research : further participation by the Agency in the management of research and innovation activities, including the use of advanced surveillance technology such as remotely piloted aircraft systems; deployment of an own technical equipment pool by acquiring itself or in co-ownership with a Member State and managing a pool of technical equipment provided by the Member States, based on the needs identified by the Agency and by requiring that the technical equipment pool be completed by means of transport and operating equipment purchased by Member States under the Specific Actions of the Internal Security Fund; coast guard functions : European cooperation on coast guard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coast guard functions; increased cooperation with third countries by coordinating operational cooperation between Member States and third countries in border management, including the coordination of joint operations, as well as by cooperating with the authorities of third countries on return, including as regards the acquisition of travel documents; strengthen the mandate of the Agency to process personal data by also allowing for the processing of personal data in the organisation and coordination of joint operations, pilot projects, rapid border interventions, return operations, return interventions and in the framework of the migration management support teams, as well as in the exchange of information with Member States, the European Asylum Support Office, Europol, Eurojust or other Union Agencies; guaranteeing the protection of fundamental rights by setting up a complaint mechanism. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, to be built from the existing Frontex, is tasked with the management of the external borders alongside the Member States. The subsidy for Frontex, which is to be renamed European Border and Coast Guard Agency, already forms part of the Union’s budget. The Agency’s budgets for 2015 and 2016 have been reinforced in 2015 in order to enable it to address the migratory crisis, in particular by tripling the financial resources for joint operations Poseidon and Triton, extending the Agency’s support to the Member States in the area of returns and giving to necessary resources to implement hotspots. The final EU subsidy for 2016 as adopted by the Budgetary Authority is EUR 238 686 000. However, for the Agency to adequately address its new tasks as foreseen in this proposal, in 2017 an amount of at least EUR 31.5 million will need to be added to the Agency’s Union budget in addition to that one for 2016."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions, such as border control, maritime safety and security, search and rescue operations, fisheries control, pollution control etc., are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The objective of this initiative is to improve European cooperation on coastguard functions by developing cross-sectoral cooperation among the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to improve synergies between those agencies, in order to provide more efficient and cost-effective multipurpose services to national authorities carrying out coastguard functions. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency should therefore strengthen their cooperation both with each other and with the national authorities carrying out coastguard functions to increase maritime situational awareness as well as to support coherent and cost-efficient action. The additional tasks for EMSA are fully in line with European Border and Coast Guard Agency and EFCA mandates and will assist them to also fulfil their duties and tasks. CONTENT: this legislative proposal forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes proposals for a Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency and to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency. The proposal stipulates that the EMSA shall, in cooperation with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Fisheries Control Agency, support national authorities carrying out coastguard functions at national and Union level, and where appropriate at international level by: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the agencies, in accordance with their respective legal bases and without prejudice to the ownership of data by Member States; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building by elaborating guidelines , recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhancing the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative requires an increase in the EU contribution to EMSA of around EUR 22 million per year (that is around EUR 87 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 17 TA staff. This is operational expenditure for around EUR 81 million mainly to cover provision of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) services for border control surveillance (EUR 67 million) and satellite aerial surveillance (SAT-AIS) and Satcom data and services to increase the surveillance capability of the 3 agencies and national authorities to strengthen as a primary objective the control of the external maritime borders of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: national authorities carrying out coastguard functions are responsible for a wide range of missions, including but not limited to maritime safety, security, search and rescue, border control, fisheries control, customs control, general law enforcement and environmental protection. The underlying problem is that coastguard functions are currently carried out by more than 300 authorities in Member States, which are not always well coordinated even at national level. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency established, the European Fisheries Control Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and the European Council support the national authorities in the exercise of most of these functions. They should therefore strengthen their cooperation with each other and with those national authorities carrying out coastguard functions in order to increase the maritime situational awareness and to support coherent and cost-efficient action. CONTENT: the purpose of this legislative proposal is to improve co-operation and co-ordination between the relevant Member States' authorities, EU agencies and other bodies performing coastguard functions with a view to moving towards a European Coastguard Capacity/System. It forms part of a set of measures proposed by the Commission to reinforce the protection of Europe's external borders, including European cooperation on coastguard function, which also includes a proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) and a proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The substantive amendments in this proposal are identical to the proposed amendments to the Regulation establishing EMSA and the proposed provisions on European coastguard cooperation in the proposal for a Regulation establishing European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The proposed Regulation covers: sharing information generated by fusing and analysing data available in ship reporting systems and other information systems hosted by or accessible to the Agencies. It will foster intelligence sharing amongst the Agencies; providing surveillance and communication services based on state-of-the-art technology, including space-based and ground infrastructure and sensors mounted on any kind of platform; capacity building at national and Union level by elaborating guidelines, recommendations and best practices as well as by supporting the training and exchange of staff, with a view to enhance the exchange of information and cooperation on coastguard functions. Thanks to its international mandate, the EFCA has, so far, developed robust expertise in implementing common inspection platforms and maintains privileged network with EU and third countries such as Albania, Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco; capacity sharing , including the planning and implementation of multipurpose operations and the sharing of assets and other capabilities across sectors and borders. It will permit the EFCA to increase its control and inspection activities and conduct new type of operations aiming at detecting criminal activities, disrupt trafficking routes and ensure the enforcement of EU and national legislations. The Commission may adopt, in the form of a recommendation, a practical handbook on European cooperation on coastguard functions, containing guidelines, recommendations and best practices for the exchange of information and cooperation at national, Union and international level. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this initiative will imply an increase in the EU contribution to the EFCA of around EUR 7.5 million per year (that is EUR 30.148 million for the 2017 to 2020 period) and the recruitment of 13 TA staff."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the new OLAF Regulation (Regulation 883/2013), the Supervisory Committee of the European Anti-Fraud Office is tasked with regularly monitoring the implementation by the Office of its investigative function, in order to reinforce its independence, and in particular to monitor developments concerning the application of procedural guarantees and the duration of investigations in the light of the information supplied by the Director General. However, in the recent past some concerns have been voiced about possible conflicts of interest and calls have been made for a strengthened legal independence as regards the management of the Committee's budget and secretariat. Thus, in its Annual Activity Reports of 2013 and 2014, the Supervisory Committee underlined the importance of its independent and effective functioning which requires an independent and adequately staffed secretariat. The European Parliament called several times on the Commission to take measures to reinforce the independent functioning of OLAF's Supervisory Committee secretariat, such as in its report on the discharge procedure for 20134 or in its resolution on the OLAF Supervisory Committee's annual report 2014. On 18 December 2015, the Commission adopted an amendment to its Decision 1999/352 in order to move the responsibility for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations for the Members from the Director-General of OLAF to the Commission. The Commission subsequently delegated this responsibility to the Director of its Payments Office (PMO). The framework for the implementation of the budgetary appropriations relating to the Members of the Supervisory Committee should be set up in a way which avoids any appearance of a possible interference of the Office in their duties. The secretariat of the Supervisory Committee should be provided directly by the Commission, independently from the Office. The Commission should refrain from interfering with the functions of the Supervisory Committee. CONTENT: in order to separate the management of the Committee's secretariat from the management of the Office and to avoid any impression that OLAF can impair the functioning of the support to the Committee's Members, the Commission proposes to modify Regulation 883/2013 to foresee that the secretariat of the Supervisory Committee will be provided directly by the Commission, and no longer by OLAF. Lastly, the proposal seeks to amend the wording of Regulation so that the competence of OLAF's Data Protection Officer (DPO) will continue to cover the processing of data by the secretariat. Also, the secretariat's staff will continue to be subject to the same confidentiality rules as before. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed Regulation will not require any new human or administrative resources and will have no financial impact. It will only transfer the management of the budgetary appropriations concerning the secretariat of OLAF's Supervisory Committee within the Commission."

BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary impact shall be exclusively limited to the revenue side. The amounts are estimated at EUR 1.3 million per year. The method used for calculation of revenues: unit value of average similar trade imports for years 2012-2014 multiplied by the new tariff rate quotas volumes multiplied by the in-quota rate duty (20%) minus 25% deduction for collection costs. For subsequent years, the unit value has been considered as constant."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: high quality, comparable, up-to-date, reliable and harmonised information on natural gas and electricity prices charged to final customers are needed in order to draft Energy Union policy and monitor the Member States’ energy markets. Up to the present date, Directive 2008/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has provided a common framework for producing, transmitting and disseminating comparable statistics on the natural gas and electricity retail prices charged to industrial customers in the Union. National authorities collect price data for household customers on the basis of a voluntary agreement. The growing complexity of the internal energy market make it increasingly difficult to obtain reliable and up-to-date price data for natural gas and electricity in the absence of legally binding obligations to provide such data, in particular for the household sector. In order to guarantee the reporting of high quality price data for the household sector and for the non-household sector, the Commission considered that the collection of both types of data should be covered by a legal act. The European Commission adopted on 25 February 2015 the Energy Union Package. One of the actions of the Energy Union Package under the chapter of the internal energy market defines an analysis of energy prices and costs to be carried out in 2016 and every 2 years thereafter. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to establish a common framework for the development, production and dissemination of comparable European statistics on natural gas and electricity prices for household and final non-household customers in the EU. It repeals Directive 2008/92/EC. While applying the principle of maintaining a reduced burden on respondents and of administrative simplification, Member States shall compile data on natural gas and electricity prices and their sub-components on network costs and taxes, levies, fees and charges as referred to in Annexes I and II and on consumption volumes. The system of consumption bands used by the Commission (Eurostat) in its price publications should ensure the transparency of the market and the broad dissemination of non-confidential price data and should enable the calculation of European aggregates. Detailed data on the breakdown of consumption bands and their respective market shares are an essential part of natural gas and electricity price statistics. Members States should regularly prepare quality reports and assessments of the quality of the price data. Member States shall not be obliged to transmit data on natural gas prices for household customers to the Commission (Eurostat) if the consumption of natural gas in the household sector is below a threshold of 1 % of national total energy consumption in the household sector. Based on a justified request from a Member State, the Commission may grant derogations to Member States in relation to those specific obligations for which the application of this Regulation to the national statistical system of a Member State requires major adaptations and is likely to lead to a significant additional burden on respondents. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Switzerland, of the other, on the free movement of persons was signed on 21 June 1999 and entered into force on 1 June 2002. It has since been extended twice, notably to states in eastern Europe: first of all to the Czech Republic, Estonia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia (entry into force in 2006) and Bulgaria and Romania (entry into force in 2009). It is now necessary to revise the 2002 Agreement to take account of Croatia’s accession to the EU on 1 July 2013. On 24 September 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Switzerland with a view to concluding the relevant protocol. The negotiations were successfully concluded by the initialling of the Protocol. It is now necessary to approve the Protocol on behalf of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS: Article 217 in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: with this proposed Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and Switzerland of the other, on the free movement of persons to take account of the accession of Croatia to the European Union. Principles: the Protocol seeks to revise the 2002 Agreement in order to take into account the accession of Croatia as regards the free movement of persons. It is provided that for a period of 7 years from the entry into force of the Protocol, Switzerland may limit the access of Croatian citizens into the labour market (quotas, priority to local workers, control of working conditions and wages). During the last two years of this transition period, the restrictions must be accepted by a mixed Switzerland-EU committee. Labour market restrictions: Switzerland may maintain quantitative limits in respect of access by workers employed in Switzerland and for self-employed persons who are nationals of Croatia for the following two categories of residence: N.B.: the draft Protocol does not provide any restrictions on residence of less than four months. The quantitative limits are set for each year of the Protocol’s seven year implementation. The quotas for each year are progressive so that Switzerland may open gradually, year by year, its labour market to Croatian workers. Regular labour market and controls: further provisions are laid down to enable Switzerland and Croatia to maintain the controls on the priority of workers integrated into the regular labour market and the wage and working conditions applicable to nationals of the other Contracting Party concerned. The same controls may be maintained for persons providing services in the following sectors: Review of the Protocol: before the end of the transitional period, the Joint Committee shall review the functioning of the transitional period applied to nationals of Croatia on the basis of a report from Switzerland. Upon completion of the review, Switzerland shall notify the Joint Committee whether it will continue applying quantitative limits to workers employed in Switzerland. Switzerland may continue to apply such measures for five years after the entry into force of the aforementioned Protocol. Croatia should be entitled to introduce the same quantitative limits for Swiss nationals for the same periods. Safeguard clause: at the end of the 7-year period of the Protocol, Switzerland shall have the opportunity for a further three years, to unilaterally activate the safeguard clause against Croatian citizens with a view to limiting the number of residence permits to allow them to work. Specific provisions are laid down to this effect. Duration of the transitional period: the total transition period with safeguard clause – if applicable – is 10 years from the date of entry into force of the Protocol. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on the EU budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the Tripartite Social Summit for Growth and Employment (TSS) was set up by Council Decision 2003/174/EC, which formalised the practice of holding highlevel, informal meetings since 1997 in the framework of the European Employment Strategy, and subsequently the Lisbon Strategy. This Decision was proposed to institutionalise the practice of high-level consultation between the EU institutions and the EU social partners. The proposal meant abolishing the former Standing Committee on Employment, which was set up in 1970 and reformed in 1999. Since 2003, the TSS has been a separate event from the European Council meetings and has broadly fulfilled its aim of facilitating the exchange of views at the highest level between the Commission, the EU Presidency and the EU social partners on employment and social aspects of the Lisbon Strategy (since 2010, and then of the Europe 2020 Strategy). Until the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, the meetings were co-chaired by the Council Presidency and the President of the Commission. The 2003 Decision also gave a role to the two subsequent Presidencies. In its Communication of 2 October 2013 on the social dimension of the EMU, the Commission announced that it will present a proposal to revise the 2003 Council Decision. This is the aim of this proposal. The amendment of the 2003 Council Decision is also needed as a result of the institutional changes brought in by the Treaty of Lisbon. In addition, the overall policy framework needs to be revised, replacing the Lisbon Strategy with the Europe 2020 Strategy and specifying how the TSS for Growth and Employment contributes to the overall governance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to revise the 2003 Council Decision. The main provisions may be summarised as follows: Task: its tasks shall be to: Membership: the main amendments concern the membership of the TSS. The Summit shall consist of the: President of the European Council, The ministers from those three presidencies and the Commissioner responsible for employment and social affairs shall also be present. The social partners’ representatives shall be divided into two delegations of equal size comprising 10 workers’ representatives and 10 employers’ representatives, taking into account the need to ensure a balanced participation between men and women. Each delegation shall consist of representatives of European cross-industry organisations, either representing general interests or more specific interests of supervisory and managerial staff and small and medium-sized businesses at European level. Technical coordination shall be provided for the workers’ delegation by the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and for the employers’ delegation by the Confederation of European Business (BUSINESSEUROPE). Technical provisions are set out as regards: Presidency and organisation: the Summit shall be chaired jointly by the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. The meetings of the Summit shall be convened by the joint chairmen on their own initiative, in consultation with the social partners."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The negotiations have been concluded and the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States (comprising Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland (BLMNS) and South Africa). The negotiations were completed at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. The Agreement was initialled on 15 July 2014 in Pretoria. It should be noted that: The SADC EPA will provide a uniform access regime for the BLMNS countries. For South Africa, the SADC EPA will replace the relevant provisions of Titles II and III of the TDCA, dealing respectively with trade and trade related issues. It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Council is called upon to adopt a Decision to approve, on behalf of the European Union and its Member States, the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the SADC EPA States, of the other part. Scope and purpose of the Agreement: the Agreement contains provisions on: The Agreement also contains rendez-vous clauses on trade in services and investment, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and public procurement. Trade provisions: the SADC EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement. It offers asymmetric market access to the SADC EPA States, which allows them to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation; it provides a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection; it contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate exports; and it eliminates the use of export subsidies in trade between the Parties. The EPA guarantees duty-free, quota-free access to the EU market for Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, and Swaziland, with the exception of arms and ammunition. South Africa will benefit from new market access additional to the TDCA, that currently governs its trade relations with the EU. The EU will obtain meaningful new market access into the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and will have the security of a bilateral agreement with Mozambique, one of the LDCs in the region. The EPA is designed to be compatible with the operation of SACU, in particular by fully harmonising SACU's import trade regime. SACU presents a single external schedule of tariffs and quota arrangements applied to imports from the EU. The SADC EPA also contains a chapter on Trade and Sustainable Development that links the trade agreement to EU objectives in the field of labour, environment, and climate change. Institutional provisions and monitoring: the Parties undertake to continuously monitor the operation and impact of this Agreement. The institutional provisions establish a Joint Council at Ministerial level to be responsible for the operation and implementation of the Agreement and to monitor the fulfilment of its objectives. The Joint Council shall be assisted by a Trade and Development Committee. Furthermore, the Agreement: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal is without budgetary implications on Union expenditure but will have a budgetary impact on the revenue side. Thus, foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 33.3 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years. This estimate is based on the average volume of imports over the period 2012-2014. With the exception of a number of products imported from South Africa, imports from the SADC EPA Group already enter the European Union duty free."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the effective return of third country nationals who do not fulfil or no longer fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member State of the Union is an essential part of a comprehensive approach to ensure the proper functioning of the EU migration policies and for maintaining public trust in the Union migration system. However, the EU system to return irregular migrants is not sufficiently effective. The lack of valid travel documents issued by the country of destination of the returnee is one of the main obstacles to successful return. At present, Member States may issue a substitute document for those illegally staying third-country nationals who do not possess a valid travel document. However, its recognition by third countries is low, including because of its unsatisfactory security features and standards. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish a dedicated European travel document for the return of third-country nationals subject to a return decision. It aims to: harmonise the format and technical specifications of the European travel document for the return of illegally staying third-country nationals in order to ensure higher technical and security standards, in particular as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification; facilitate recognition of this document by third countries for the purpose of return and readmission; increase flexibility for the authorities of third countries in terms of managing documents in order for them to accelerate the administrative procedures for return and reduce the administrative burden on competent consular authorities; set the rules relating to the fees for issuing the European travel document for return, which shall be free of charge for the third-country national given that it shall only be valid for a single journey; contribute to reducing the period during which returnees awaiting removal are kept in administrative detention."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (known as COP 21), which took place in Paris from 30 November to 12 December 2015, the text of an agreement was adopted, concerning the strengthening of the global response to climate change. In its communication assessing the implications of the Paris Agreement, the Commission stated that the Paris Agreement should be signed and ratified as soon as possible. In its conclusions of 18 March 2016, the European Council underlined the need for the European Union and its Member States to conclude the Paris Agreement as soon as possible and on time so as to be parties as of its entry into force. As a first step, the Agreement was signed by the Commission and Council on behalf of the European Union and by all 28 Member States on their behalf at the high-level signature ceremony which took place in New York on 22 April 2016. The Paris Agreement is in conformity with the environmental objectives of the Union as referred to in Article 191 of the Treaty, namely preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment; protecting human health; and promoting measures at international level to deal with regional or worldwide environmental problems, and in particular combating climate change. The 2030 climate and energy policy framework for the EU sets an ambitious economy-wide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at least 40% domestically by 2030, as well as renewable energy and energy efficiency targets of at least 27%. Implementing the 2030 energy and climate framework is a priority in follow up to the Paris Agreement. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Paris Agreement adopted on 12 December 2015 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Paris Agreement is a global milestone for enhancing global collective action and accelerating the global transformation to a low-carbon and climate resilient society. It will replace the approach taken under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, that contains commitments until the end of 2020. These commitments will not be continued beyond 2020. The Paris Agreement sets out a qualitative long-term emissions reduction goal in line with the objective to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to keep it to 1.5°C. In order to achieve this goal, the parties will prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. Starting from 2023, parties will every 5 years undertake a global stocktake, based on the latest science and implementation to date, which will track progress and consider emission reductions, adaptation and support provided. The Agreement will enter into force on the 30th day after the date on which at least 55 parties to the Convention accounting in total for at least an estimated 55% of global greenhouse gas emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Stockholm Programme put a strong focus on the strengthening of the rights of individuals in criminal proceedings. The European Council asked the Commission to put forward proposals setting out a step by step approach to strengthening the rights of suspects and accused persons. Up to now, three measures have been adopted: Directive 2010/64/EU on the right to interpretation and translation, Directive 2012/13/EU on the right to information and Directive 2013/48/EU on the right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings. The proposal continues this work and is part of a series of measures on criminal justice which includes: (i) a directive on strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and of the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings; (ii) a directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. This measure is presented together with a Commission Recommendation on the right to legal aid for suspects or accused persons in criminal proceedings. By establishing minimum rules on the protection of procedural rights of suspects or accused persons, this Directive should strengthen the mutual trust of judicial authorities and can thus help improve mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission has undertaken an impact assessment in support of its proposal. CONTENT :the draft directive aims to: ·  ensure the effectiveness of the right of access to a lawyer at an early stage in the criminal proceedings for suspects and accused persons deprived of liberty; ·  ensure that requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings have access to legal aid to ensure the right of access to a lawyer in both the executing and issuing Member State (""right of dual defence""). The directive will apply from the deprivation of liberty, i.e. as from the moment one is taken into police custody or similar custody, which also covers periods before formal charge and arrest has taken place. Provisional legal aid : it is in the early phase of the proceedings, especially if deprived of liberty, that suspects or accused persons will be the most vulnerable and most in need of legal aid to be assisted by a lawyer. Therefore, the draft directive makes provisions for provisional legal aid. The proposal states the exercise of the right to provisional legal aid and access to a lawyer must become practicable and effective without undue delay after deprivation of liberty and before any questioning. The right to provisional legal aid should last at least until the competent authority has made the final decision on whether the suspect or accused person is eligible and benefits from legal aid. The right to provisional legal aid also applies to requested persons in European arrest warrant proceedings who are deprived of liberty. Legal aid for requested persons : in order to improve mutual trust and make the right to dual defence in European arrest warrant proceedings effective (in both the executing and issuing Member State), the Directive also requires Member States to give access to legal aid, beyond provisional legal aid as the requested persons are not always deprived of liberty. In the period leading up to the final decision on whether the requested person benefits from legal aid in the executing Member State, requested persons that are deprived of liberty are entitled to provisional legal aid in the executing Member State Non-regression clause : the proposal aims to ensure that setting common minimum standards does not have the effect of lowering existing higher standards in certain Member States and the standards in the Charter and the European Convention on Human Rights."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2005, the Council of the European Union adopted Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The Regulation entered into force on 30 July 2006. In response to calls from the European Parliament in 2010 and indications that medicines exported from the Union had been used for capital punishment in a third country, the lists of prohibited and controlled goods in Annexes II and III to that Regulation were amended by means of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1352/2011. The Commission also started a process to review Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 in its entirety, responding in particular to a Resolution of the European Parliament of 17 June 2010. In spring 2012, the Commission issued a call for applications with a view to establishing a Group of Experts to assist it with this review. During the period from July 2012 to July 2013, the Group of Experts met six times in Brussels with relevant Commission services. CONTENT: the main amendments that the Commission proposes to make to Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 focus on the following: Export controls targeting capital punishment : given these firm international commitments under either Protocol No 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights or, the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, exports to the States that are parties to one of them need not be subject to specific authorisation in order to prevent the relevant goods from being used for capital punishment and can be covered by a general export authorisation. According to the proposal, such authorisation should be subject to appropriate conditions to avoid the diversion of the goods to a country that has not abolished capital punishment without prior scrutiny by the competent authorities. The general authorisation should, therefore, only apply where the end-user of the exported goods is established in the country of destination and no re-export to another country takes place. If these conditions are not met, a request for a specific or global authorisation should be made to the competent authorities. Additional measures concerning listed goods : the proposal prohibits brokers in the Union from providing brokering services in relation to goods whose export and import are prohibited as such goods have no practical use other than for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Prohibiting the provision of such services serves the purpose of protecting public morals. Where controls on exports are applied, the provision of brokering services and the supply of technical assistance in relation to any of the listed goods should be prohibited, if the broker or supplier of technical assistance is aware that the relevant goods are or may be intended for capital punishment, when the controls are applied to prevent use for such punishment, or for torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, when the controls are intended to prevent such use. Definition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment : the definition in Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 currently covers acts inflicting ‘significant pain or suffering’, whereas the definition of torture refers to ‘severe pain or suffering’. Instead of being based on different levels of pain or suffering, the distinction between these types of acts should take account of the presence or absence of an intention to inflict pain or suffering and of the use of pain or suffering for a purpose included in the definition of torture. The definition of ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’, which is not found in the Convention, should be amended to align it with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights. The Commission also considers it appropriate to clarify the meaning of the term ‘lawful penalties’ in the definitions of ‘torture’ and ‘other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment’, taking into account this case-law and the Union’s policy on capital punishment. Exchange of information between customs authorities : the proposal requires customs authorities to share certain information with other customs authorities and, when they detect prohibited exports or imports of goods or exports of goods for which the required authorisation has not been granted, to inform the relevant authorities with a view to imposing penalties on the economic operator that committed the infringement. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: China is among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the Schengen area. EU citizens also need a visa to enter China. In the context of the EU-China Mobility and Migration Dialogue established in October 2013, the European Union and China agreed on a cooperation package comprising measures in the area of irregular migration and visa policy that would be negotiated or implemented in two interdependent phases: On 14 September 2015 the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China for a short-stay visa waiver agreement for holders of diplomatic passports and addressed negotiating directives to the Commission. The negotiations were opened on 21 September. The agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators of the EU and China respectively on 3 and 4 November 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and China on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic passports. The main provisions of the proposal may be summarised as follows: Purpose and scope: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for citizens of the European Union holding a valid diplomatic passport or an EU laissez-passer and for citizens of China holding a valid diplomatic passport when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that China may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The Decision constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom and Ireland are therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Decision and are not bound by it or subject to its application. Duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as these Member States ((currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania) are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the Chinese holders of diplomatic passports to stay for 90 days in any 180-day period on the territory of each of those Member States, independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Visits by high officials: the agreement stipulates that officials at or above vice-ministerial level of the central government and officers of or above the rank of major general of the armed forces must inform the competent authorities of the country to be visited through diplomatic channels before they travel to its territory for official purposes. Exchange of specimens: the agreement provides for the exchange of specimens of diplomatic passports and the EU laissez-passer no later than 90 days after the date of signature of the agreement. Territorial application: the agreement clarifies that the visa waiver for Chinese holders of diplomatic passports only applies to the European territories of France and the Netherlands. Joint declarations: a joint declaration on the interpretation of the period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. In addition to the joint declaration, two other joint declarations are attached to the agreement regarding: The agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the agreement whose tasks include, among others, the monitoring of its implementation as well as suggesting amendments or additions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the sustained financial and economic crisis is increasing the pressure on national financial resources, as Member States are reducing their budgets. In this context, ensuring a smooth implementation of ESIF programmes is of particular importance as a tool for injecting funds into the economy. Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that on the request of a Member State with temporary budgetary difficulties, i.e. those countries which have received financial assistance under an adjustment programme after 21 December 2013, interim payments may be increased by 10 percentage points above the co-financing rate applicable to each priority for the ERDF, ESF, and the Cohesion Fund or to each measure for the EAFRD and the EMFF, provided the Member State submits a corresponding request. This provision currently applies until 30 June 2016. Article 120(3) of the same Regulation provides that from 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2017, the maximum co-financing rate at the level of each priority for all operational programmes supported by the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus shall be 85 % instead of 50 % applicable to more developed regions. The Regulation requires the Commission to review these two financial provisions and make, if necessary, a legislative proposal before 30 June 2016 with a view to their possible extension. The Five countries were eligible for the 10% top-up on interim payments submitted before 30 June 2016. Since then the financial assistance programmes for Cyprus, Ireland, Portugal and Romania have expired. This means that Greece is the only country under an adjustment programme on 30 June 2016. Cyprus exited its adjustment programme at the end of March 2016. However, the economic situation of Cyprus is still fragile as reflected by its sluggish growth rate, declining investment, high unemployment and stressed financial sector. CONTENT: in order to ensure that Member States with temporary budgetary difficulties continue implementing the ESIF programmes and disburse funds to projects, the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 would allow the Commission to: top up payments to a Member State under an adjustment programme after 30 June 2016 (currently Greece). It would cover the period until 30 June of the year following the calendar year in which the Member State stops receiving financial assistance. This approach is in line with the ESI Funds accounting year which covers the period from 1 July to 30 June. It would extend the period of eligibility up to maximum 18 months; extend the exceptional cofinancing rate of 85 % for the ERDF and ESF in Cyprus until programme closure with a view to easing the pressure on the national budget and accelerating much-needed investments. The total financial allocation for the period from the Funds to the countries and the programmes in question will not change. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of ESIF financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2014-2020. For payment appropriations, the proposal can result in a higher reimbursement to the Member States concerned. Based on the payment forecast from Member States revised by the Commission and the payment appropriations included in the 2016 budget and in the 2017 Draft Budget, the need for payment appropriations are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 544 million. The additional payment appropriations for this proposal may imply a temporary increase of payment appropriations, which would be compensated by lower payments at the end of the life cycle of the 2014-2020 programmes."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: significant progress has been achieved in the past 20 years in the Union in the field of anthropogenic air emissions and air quality by a dedicated Union policy, including the 2005 Communication from the Commission ""Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution”. Directive 2001/81/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council has been instrumental in this progress by setting caps on Member States' total annual emissions for 2010 onwards of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3) and volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC). As a result, SO2 emissions were reduced by 82%, NOx emissions by 47%, NMVOC emissions by 56% and NH3 emissions by 28% between 1990 and 2010. However, as indicated in the ""Clean Air Programme for Europe"" (""revised TSAP""), significant adverse impacts and risks remain on the environment and human health. There is a need to review and update these requirements to address the highly significant remaining health risks and environmental impacts posed by air pollution in the Union, and to align Union law with new international commitments following a revision of the Gothenburg Protocol in 2012. The revised TSAP sets out new strategic objectives for the period up to 2030 with a view to moving further towards the Union's long-term objective. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment modelled the optimal delivery of the desired reduction, and this optimisation yielded national emission reduction commitments for the six most relevant pollutants. These reduction commitments will reduce total external costs of air pollution by EUR 40 billion (on the most conservative valuation) compared to the EUR 212 billion in the baseline, including direct economic benefits amounting to more than EUR 2.8 billion. The baseline shall deliver in 2030 a reduction of health burden by 40% as compared to 2005. This proposal delivers an extra 12%, which makes a 52% reduction in total regarding health burden as compared to 2005. For eutrophication, it delivers an extra 50% on top of the baseline. CONTENT: the proposal repeals and replaces the current Union regime on the annual capping of national emissions of air pollutants, as defined in Directive 2001/81/EC. By doing so: it ensures that the national emission ceilings (NECs) set in Directive 2001/81/EC for 2010 onwards for SO2, NOx, NMVOC and NH3 shall apply until 2020; establishes new national emission reduction commitments (""reduction commitments"") applicable from 2020 and 2030 for SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, fine particulate matter (PM2,5) and methane (CH4) as well as intermediate emission levels for the year 2025 applicable to the same pollutants. National reduction commitments : the proposal provides that the Member States must limit their annual emissions of SO2, NOx, NMVOC, NH3, PM2,5 and CH4, to meet their reduction commitments applicable from 2020 and 2030. Furthermore, Member States must limit in 2025 their annual emissions of those pollutants to the levels defined on the basis of a linear reduction trajectory, unless this would require measures entailing disproportionate costs. The proposal also indicates what emission sources should not be accounted for. Flexibilities : the proposal entitles Member States to use certain flexibilities, provided that the Commission does not object: to account for a share of NOx, SO2, and PM2,5 emission reductions achieved by international maritime traffic under certain conditions; to implement jointly their reduction commitments for CH4; and to propose adjusted emission inventories when non-compliance with a reduction commitment (save for CH4) results from improved inventory methodology. In addition, the proposal: requires the Member States to adopt, implement and regularly update their national air pollution control programmes (NAPCPs) describing how their reduction commitments shall be met; requires Member States to monitor air pollutant emissions and, in so doing, prepare and update national emission inventories and projections to be accompanied by an informative inventory report (IIR); states that Member States shall monitor, where practicable, the adverse impacts of air pollution upon water and terrestrial ecosystems; requires Member States to communicate to the Commission, at the dates specified, their NAPCP and any updates and all monitoring information; the Commission, assisted by the European Environment Agency and Member States, shall regularly verify the accuracy and completeness of reported national emission inventory data; seeks to promote cooperation between the Commission and Member States with third countries and relevant international organisations to further and better address air pollutant emissions at a global level; lays down the provisions on penalties applicable to breaches of the national provisions enacted pursuant to the proposal, on the entry into force and the transposition of the proposal into Member States’ legislation; provides that the Commission shall report every five years on the implementation of this Directive. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since early 2011, the Jordanian economy has been significantly affected by the ongoing regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria. Combined with a weaker global environment, this regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on external receipts and has strained public finances. The Syrian conflict has impacted Jordan not only by disrupting trade with and through Syria but also by causing an inflow of around 1.3 million of Syrian refugees into Jordan that has increased pressure on Jordan's fiscal position, public services and infrastructure. In 2012, Jordan and the IMF agreed on a first adjustment programme, which was supported by a three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of USD 2 billion. This programme was successfully completed in August 2015. The IMF programme was complemented by a first Macro-Financial Assistance from the European Union (the EU) in the amount of EUR 180 million (MFA-I), which was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council in December 2013 and was disbursed in two tranches of EUR 100 million and EUR 80 million in February 2015 and in October 2015, respectively. While the country made progress with macroeconomic stabilisation and reform under the first programme supported by the IMF, the EU and other donors, the persistence of the conflicts in neighbouring Syria and Iraq continued to disrupt Jordan's foreign trade and undermine investor and tourist confidence, with the economic situation deteriorating again in 2015. In this context, the Jordanian government has called for increased support from the international community to address the economic consequences of the Syrian crisis, and in particular the presence of a large number of Syrian refugees in Jordan. At the conference 'Supporting Syria and the Region', held in London on 4 February 2016, the international community pledged about USD 10 billion to help the countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. Of this amount, the EU pledged EUR 2.39 billion for the countries affected by the Syrian refugee crisis including a EUR 200 million loan for the purpose of a second Macro-Financial Assistance operation for Jordan (MFA-II). This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to make MFA available to Jordan for a total maximum amount of EUR 200 million, provided in the form of a medium-term loan. The assistance will contribute to cover Jordan's residual external financing needs in 2016-2017, as identified by the Commission based on the estimates of the IMF. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments of EUR 100 million each. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place towards the end of 2016. The second instalment, conditional on a number of policy measures, could be disbursed in the second quarter of 2017. The assistance will be managed by the Commission. Specific provisions on the prevention of fraud and other irregularities, consistent with the Financial Regulation, are applicable? The loans shall have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Conditions granting assistance : the Union's macro-financial assistance should support Jordan's commitment to values shared with the Union, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the respect for human rights. Disbursements : the disbursements would be conditional on successful programme reviews under the new IMF's financial arrangement. The Commission and the Jordanian authorities would agree on specific structural reform measures in a Memorandum of Understanding aiming to improve the overall macroeconomic management and the conditions for sustainable growth. These reform measures would support the authorities’ reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF, the World Bank and other donors, as well as the policy programmes associated with the EU’s budgetary support operations. They would be consistent with the economic reform priorities agreed between the EU and Jordan in the context of the Single Support Framework for 2014-2017 and other strategic documents (including the future Partnership Priorities and the Jordan Compact). They would also build upon the structural reforms implemented under MFA-I. Availability of assistance : the proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. Implementing powers : in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Decision, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Considering the potentially important impact of assistance, it is appropriate that the examination procedure be used in this context. Follow-up and reporting : by 30 June of each year, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council a report on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year, including an evaluation of that implementation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of a loan and would be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning of the EU's Guarantee Fund for external actions, at a rate of 9 % of the amounts disbursed, from budget line 01 03 06 (""Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund""). Assuming that the first loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) will be made in 2016 and the second loan disbursement (of EUR 100 million) in 2017 in accordance with the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the 2018-19 budgets. Based on current projections on the utilisation of the budget line 01 03 06, the Commission assesses that the budgetary impact of the operation can be accommodated."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: European society is ageing. Pension systems across the European Union (EU) have to adapt in order to ensure adequate, safe and sustainable pensions. The institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs) sector is being developed in many Member States where occupational pensions so far play a limited role, including by setting up regulatory frameworks. Failing to provide an up-to-date EU regulatory framework now entails the risk that Member States continue to develop diverging solutions, thereby exacerbating regulatory fragmentation. Furthermore, improvements to the performance of occupational pensions require long periods of time to materialise. According to the Commission, a revision of Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision is necessary for the following reasons: (1) protect members and beneficiaries, and facilitate safe cross-border provisioning through higher governance standards reflecting best practices at national level following the economic and financial crisis; (2) reduce the obstacles to develop cross border occupational pensions markets, which would help companies, including SMEs and multinationals, to organise their pension provision on a European scale more efficiently; (3) there is evidence of significant gaps in the level of information provided to scheme members and beneficiaries across the EU. This proposal builds on a number of initiatives launched in recent years such as the White Paper on pensions and the Green Paper on long-term financing of the European economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment report that considers a range of policy options and sub-options. The report was first submitted to the Impact Assessment Board on 4 September 2013. The Board asked for resubmission with additional information on the views of the different stakeholder groups, problem definition, subsidiarity and proportionality aspects, options and expected impacts. The impact assessment was resubmitted on 16 October 2013. On 6 November the Board stated it could not issue a positive opinion and requested some further amendments. CONTENT: this proposal to recast Directive 2003/41/EC has four specific objectives: 1. Removing remaining prudential barriers for cross-border IORPs , notably by: requiring that the rules on investment and disclosure of information to members and beneficiaries are those of the home Member State, clarifying procedures for cross-border activities, clearly defining the scope of action of home and host Member State. 2. Ensuring good governance and risk management : the proposal: (i) establishes that institutions need to have in place an effective system of governance which provides for sound and prudent management of their activities; (ii) sets out that institutions must have a sound remuneration policy; (iii) provides for an effective internal audit function which evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system; (iv) sets out that IORPs need to appoint a single depositary for safekeeping of assets and oversight duties if members and beneficiaries fully bear the investment risk. 3. Providing clear and relevant information to members and beneficiaries : the proposal places an obligation on IORPs to provide, every twelve months, a pension benefit statement (‘PBS’) for the individual in the clearest possible way, also as a basis to feed information into a potential pension tracking service. 4. Ensuring that supervisors have the necessary tools to effectively supervise IORPs : the proposal lays down that the competent authority of the home Member State has the sole responsibility for the prudential supervision of all IORPs authorised or registered in its jurisdiction. It establishes the principle that supervision of IORPs needs to be prospective and risk-based, as well as timely and proportionate. In addition, the proposal introduces the supervisory review process which aims to identify IORPs with financial, organisational or other features susceptible to producing a higher risk profile. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary implications relate to tasks allocated to European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). No new resources will be needed. Operation appropriations which are necessary for the implementation of this initiative will be covered by redeployment within the contribution granted to EIOPA during the annual budgetary procedure, in accordance with the financial programming set by the Communication from the Commission ""Programming of human and financial resources for decentralised agencies 2014-2020"". The estimated impact on expenditure is EUR 2.035 million for the period 2015-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: with a view to facilitating trade flows, Article 136 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 excludes the application of certain provisions of that Regulation to goods that have temporarily left the customs territory of the Union while moving between two Union ports or airports without stopping outside the Union. Those provisions are the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration, the rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or an aircraft, the rules governing the obligation to convey the goods to certain places and to present them to the customs authorities at the point in which they are unloaded or transhipped, and the rules governing temporary storage. As a result, there is no legal basis for requiring the presentation of the goods that are unloaded or transhipped at the point where the goods re-enter the customs territory of the Union after having temporarily left it. Without presentation, it may be more difficult for customs authorities to ensure the supervision of those goods, and there is a risk both, that import duty and other charges are not correctly levied, and that non-fiscal measures such as veterinary and phytosanitary controls are not properly applied. CONTENT: the proposal aims to modify Article 136 UCC in order to ensure the effective application of other UCC provisions, notably those on customs supervision. Under the proposal, the only provisions not applying when non-Union goods re-enter the Union customs territory after having temporarily left it by direct sea or air route, should be: the rules governing the obligation to lodge the entry summary declaration (Articles 127 to 130 UCC) and (2) The rules governing the obligation to notify the arrival of a sea-going vessel or aircraft to the customs office of first entry to the Union customs territory (Article 133 UCC). by contrast, the provisions governing the obligation to convey the goods to a certain place, to present them to customs upon unloading or transhipment, to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping, and the provisions on temporary storage should apply in these situations, thereby allowing appropriate customs supervision. The situation should be similar for Union goods whose status needs to be proven pursuant to Article 153(2) UCC, to the extent that the customs authorities must be able to check the proof of their Union status. Lastly, the rules governing the obligation to present the goods to customs upon unloading or transhipment and the obligation to wait for authorisation before unloading or transhipping the goods should not apply to Union goods that have retained their status by virtue of the Regulation having regard to the fact that, even if the goods have temporarily left the Union customs territory, their status has not been altered and does not need to be proven. This amendment should enter into force as soon as possible so as to contribute to effective customs supervision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council introduced a series of measures aimed at enhancing investor protection and rebuilding consumer trust in the financial services industry by increasing transparency in the retail investment market. It requires manufacturers of packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) to produce a Key Information Document (KID). The Regulation empowers the European Supervisory Authorities to prepare regulatory technical standards specifying the elements of the KID. On 6 April 2016, the ESAs jointly submitted the draft regulatory technical standards (RTS) on the KID for PRIIPs to the Commission. The draft RTS were endorsed by the Commission on 30 June 2016 by adopting the Delegated Regulation on KID. During the scrutiny period, the Council raised no objections to the Commission Delegated Regulation. However, on 14 September 2016, the European Parliament rejected it. The European Parliament called on the Commission to review the provisions relating to multi-option PRIIPs, performance scenarios and comprehension alert. Moreover, the European Parliament and a large majority of Member States asked the Commission to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. Given the exceptional circumstances that have led to delays in the adoption of the Delegated Regulation and in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules, the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 shall be deferred. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to defer the date of application of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by 12 months, until 1 January 2018, in order to reduce legal uncertainty and give more time to PRIIPs manufacturers to prepare for the application of the new rules."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries: Dominica, Grenada, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tuvalu, the United Arab Emirates and Vanuatu. On 9 October 2014, the Council addressed negotiating directives to the Commission The negotiations with Kiribati were opened on 17 December 2014 and conducted by exchange of letters. During further exchanges agreement was reached on all aspects. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 6 May 2015 (Kiribati) and 10 June 2015 (Union). The Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the Agreement between the European Union and Kiribati on the short-stay visa waiver. The content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Kiribati when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. In order to safeguard equal treatment of all EU citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that Kiribati may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of Kiribati to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For this latter category, each Member State and also Kiribati remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. In order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of Kiribati to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee for the management of the Agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. Regulation (EU) No 509/2014 was adopted on 20 May 2014 and entered into force on 9 June 2014. It is applied by all Member States with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom. In July 2014, the Commission presented a Recommendation to the Council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with each of the following 17 countries. The first series of visa waiver agreements were signed on 6 May 2015 (United Arab Emirates), 26 May 2015 (Timor-Leste) and 28 May 2015 (Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Trinidad and Tobago and Vanuatu) and provisionally apply from the date of signature pending their entry into force. The Council has authorised the signature of a second series of visa waiver agreements with Tonga (signed on 20 November 2015), Colombia (signed on 2 December 2015), Kiribati (date of signature to be determined) and Palau (signed on 7 December 2015). These four agreements provisionally apply from the day following the date of signature pending their entry into force. The negotiations with the Marshall Islands were opened on 17 December 2014. The agreement was initialled by an exchange of letters between the chief negotiators on 11 December 2015 (Marshall Islands) and 13 January 2016 (Union). The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the Union. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and the Marshall Islands on the short-stay visa waiver. The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of the Marshall Islands when travelling to the territory of the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. A joint declaration on the interpretation of this period of 90 days in any 180-day period is attached to the agreement. The agreement takes into account the situation of the Member States that do not yet apply the Schengen acquis in full. As long as they are not part of the Schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of the Marshall Islands to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those Member States (currently Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole Schengen area. A provision has been included in the agreement stating that the Marshall Islands may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the Member States of the European Union and that the Union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its Member States. Scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. For those travelling to carry out a paid activity, each Member State and also the Marshall Islands remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other Party in accordance with the applicable Union or national law. A joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. Territorial application: in the case of France and the Netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of the Marshall Islands to stay only in those Member States’ European territories. The provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. A joint declaration on the association of Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein to the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis is annexed to the agreement. Lastly, the Agreement sets up a Joint Committee of experts for the management of the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2006, a High Level Contact Group (""HLCG""), composed of senior officials from the Commission, the Council Presidency and the U.S. Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and State, was established to explore ways that would enable the EU and the U.S. to work more efficiently together in the exchange of law enforcement information while ensuring that the protection of personal data and privacy are guaranteed. The conclusion reached in the HLCG final report of October 20091 was that an international agreement binding both the EU and the U.S. to apply agreed common data protection principles for transatlantic data transfers in the law enforcement area was the best option. On 3 December 2010, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations on such an agreement between the European Union and the United States of America. On 28 March 2011, the Commission opened negotiations. On 8 September 2015, the Parties initialled the text. The Agreement should now be concluded on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the United States of America and the European Union on the protection of personal information relating to the prevention, investigation, detection, and prosecution of criminal offenses. The Agreement aims to establish a comprehensive framework of data protection principles and safeguards when personal information is transferred for criminal law enforcement purposes between the U.S., on the one hand, and the EU or its Member States on the other. The objective is to ensure a high level of personal data protection when transferred between the U.S., on the one hand, and the EU or its Member States on the other, for law enforcement purposes and, thereby, enhance cooperation between the parties. Whilst not being itself the legal basis for any transfer of personal information to the U.S., the Agreement supplements, where necessary, data protection safeguards in existing and future data transfer agreements or national provisions authorising such transfers. 1) Scope and general objectives: the Agreement aims to establish for the first time, a data protection instrument that covers in a comprehensive and consistent manner all data transfers in a given area (i.e. transatlantic data exchanges in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters). Furthermore, the Agreement will substantiate in the transatlantic context the general requirements on international data transfers laid down in the future directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and the free movement of such data adopted on 14 April 2016. 2) Data protection principles and safeguards: the Agreement covers important principles governing personal data processing as well as key safeguards and limitations: Purpose and use limitations: processing (which includes transfers) can take place only for explicit and legitimate purposes within the scope of the Umbrella Agreement, i.e. the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences. The Agreement ensures the application of the safeguards to the entire ""life cycle"" of a given data set from the original transfer from the EU to its processing by a U.S. competent authority and vice-versa, as well as its possible further processing by another U.S. authority or, in the case of a data transfer from the U.S. to a competent authority of the EU or (one of) its Member States, its possible further sharing with/processing by another EU or Member State authority. Onward transfer: if a U.S. authority intends to further transfer data it has received from the EU or one of its Member States to a third country/international organisation not bound by the agreement, it will first have to obtain consent from the law enforcement authority in the EU which has originally transferred the data to the United States. This rule equally applies where an authority of the EU or one of its Member States intends to further transfer data it has received from the U.S. to a third country/international organisation. The provisions expressly take into account the special sensitivity of the transfer in bulk of data of unsuspected persons (e.g. PNR data of every passenger taking a flight, independently of any specific suspicion). The Agreement requires that any further transfer of personal information other than in relation to specific cases, may only take place under specific conditions that provide due justification for the onward transfer. In addition, the Parties to the Agreement must take measures to ensure: Special categories of data: the processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or religious or other beliefs, trade-union membership or personal information concerning health or sexual life, may only take place when appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with law (e.g. masking the information after effecting the purpose for which the data was processed or requiring supervisory approval to access the information). 3) Individual rights: data subjects will be able, for the first time, to avail themselves of rights of general application for any transatlantic transfer of personal data in the criminal law enforcement sector, these being: 4) Aspects relating to the application of the Agreement and oversight: measures must be put in pace in order to: The Agreement will be of unlimited duration (which is justified by the nature of the Agreement as a framework providing for protections and safeguards, as well as in the light of the possibility of suspending and terminating the Agreement)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: as part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the gradual opening-up of certain Union programmes and agencies to the participation of ENP partner countries represents one of many measures to promote reform, modernisation and transition in the European Union’s neighbourhood. The Commission outlined this policy aspect more extensively in its Communication of December 2006 ‘on the general approach to enable European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries to participate in Community agencies and Community programmes’. The Council endorsed this approach in its conclusions of 5 March 2007. On 18 June 2007, the Council issued directives to the Commission to negotiate Framework Agreements with Algeria, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Morocco, the Palestinian Authority, Tunisia and Ukraine, on the general principles for their participation in Community programmes. In February 2013, Algeria expressed its interest in participating in the broad range of programmes open to partner countries of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The text of the protocol negotiated with Algeria is attached to this proposal. It is now necessary to conclude this Protocol on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Protocol to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Algeria, of the other part, on a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Algeria on the general principles for the participation of Algeria in Union programmes. It contains standard clauses that are intended to be applied to all European Neighbourhood Policy partner countries with which such protocols are concluded. Objective: the objective of the Protocol is to lay down the financial and technical rules enabling Algeria to participate in certain Union programmes. The horizontal framework established by the Protocol constitutes an economic, financial and technical cooperation measure which gives access to assistance, in particular financial assistance, to be provided by the Union pursuant to the Union programmes. This framework applies only to those Union programmes for which the relevant constitutive legal acts provide for the possibility of Algeria’s participation. The signing and provisional application of the Protocol therefore does not entail the exercise of the powers under the various sectoral policies pursued by the programmes which are exercised when establishing the programmes."

The measures taken so far have not effectively solved the main problems of the fishery, these being: Due to deep-sea stocks' high vulnerability to fishing, stock depletion can occur within a short period of time, and recovery might take very long or fail. The stocks' biological state is largely unknown. Some are considered depleted, others have started to stabilise at low levels of exploitation. In general the fisheries are not sustainable. A new regulation is required in order to deal with these problems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment of impacts resulting from different policy choices focussed on five options. Three of these were not considered further because they were considered not representing meaningful management approaches, with disadvantages largely outweighing advantages, namely: (i) to continue the current regime amending it only by needed updates; (ii) to ban fishing for deep-sea species altogether, and (iii) to scale the regime down to being a tool for transposing measures adopted in NEAFC and applying those measures also in Union waters. The two options with relative advantage were: (iv) to phase out the most harmful fishing gears targeting deep-sea species, or (v) to introduce in Union waters management standards that were developed for bottom fishing on the High Sea. Option (iv) was retained as being a more effective and simpler instrument. LEGAL BASIS: Article 43 (2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposal establishes a framework Regulation for exercising fishing activity targeting deep-sea species in the North-East Atlantics, comprising Union waters including outermost regions of Spain and Portugal, and international waters. The objectives of this Regulation are the following: ·  to ensure the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea species while minimising the impact of deep-sea fishing activities on the marine environment; ·  to improve the scientific knowledge on deep-sea species and their habitats for these purposes; ·  to implement technical measures on fisheries management recommended by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Ensure sustainable exploitation : the general objective of the proposal is to ensure as much as possible the sustainable exploitation of deep-sea stocks while reducing the environmental impact of these fisheries, and to improve the information base for scientific assessment. As long as data and method have not achieved the required level allowing MSY-based management, the fisheries have to be managed according to the precautionary approach to fisheries management. Protect marine ecosystems : in order to reduce the destructive impact on the marine ecosystem, the use of bottom trawls should be phased out in this fishery, as they are most harmful to vulnerable marine ecosystems and have shown high levels of undesired catch of deep-sea species. The transitional restrictions on bottom-set gillnets in fisheries below 600m depth and in the depth-range 200-600m should be accompanied by a prohibition to target deep-sea species. Simplifying the management system for these stocks : the proposal also considers the opportunity to simplify the management system for these stocks, currently subject to a double instrument: catch limitations and capacity/effort limitation. Where this duplication is not necessary to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, proposals are made to regulate the concerned fisheries with only one management instrument. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no implications for the EU budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council on insolvency proceedings (recast) entered into force on 26 June 2015. It will apply from 26 June 2017, with the exception of the part relating to the system for interconnection of national insolvency registers, which will apply from 26 June 2019. Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 lists the insolvency proceedings referred to in point (4) of Article 2 of the Regulation. Annex B lists the insolvency practitioners referred to in point (5) of Article 2. In December 2015, Poland notified the Commission on a substantial reform of its domestic law on restructuring, taking effect as of 1 January 2016, and requested to change the lists set out in Annexes A and B to the Regulation accordingly. After having carefully analysed the request of Poland in order to ensure compliance of the notification with the requirements of the Regulation, the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation ((EU) 2015/848 accordingly. CONTENT: the Commission proposal seeks to replace the lists for Poland in Annexes A and B to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists taking into account the information notified by that Member States. Since the Annexes are intrinsic part of the Regulation, their modification can only be achieved via the legislative amendment of the Regulation. This proposal aims at ensuring that the scope of the recast Regulation is adjusted to the actual legal framework of the Member States on insolvency by the time of its application. The envisaged amendments are of a purely technical nature. They contain no substantive change to the Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment was carried out. LEGAL BASIS: Article 207, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Uzbekistan, of the other part, entered into force on 1 July 1999. This agreement contains a provision according to which its trade provisions – namely, most favoured nation (MFN) trade conditions and abolition of quantitative restrictions – do not apply to trade in textile products, which was regulated by a separate bilateral agreement. This bilateral agreement, in force since 1 January 2000, lapsed on 31 December 2004. While in practice trade in textiles between the EU and Uzbekistan continued to proceed smoothly since 1 January 2005, legal certainty needs to be ensured. On 9 June 2010, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations with the Republic of Uzbekistan to amend the PCA, so as to ensure that the principles which apply to trade in other goods are also extended formally to trade in textile products. These negotiations have been successfully concluded and the Protocol amending the PCA by abrogating Article 16 and all references thereto, was initialled on 1 July 2010. In addition, some updates of a technical nature have been introduced. This has taken the form of the deletion of Article 8(3) and Annex I, stemming from the time of the dissolution of the USSR, and which had expired in 1998. The Council is invited to adopt the attached proposed Decision on the conclusion of a Protocol to the PCA, which shall form an integral part of the PCA.

On 26 June 2012, the EU signed a Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. The Trade Agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 March 2013 for Peru and 1 August 2013 for Colombia. On 17 July 2014, the Union and Ecuador concluded their negotiations on the Protocol to take account of the Accession of Ecuador to the Trade Agreement. The text of the Protocol was approved by the Trade Committee of the Trade Agreement at its meeting of 8 February 2016. CONTENT: the proposal for a Council Decision constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Protocol of Accession to the Trade Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Colombia and Peru on the other part, to take account of the Accession of Ecuador. The Protocol in question establishes the necessary modifications to the Trade Agreement to take account of the accession of Ecuador. The Trade Agreement establishes the conditions for EU economic operators to take full advantage of the opportunities and the emerging complementarities between our respective economies: According to the Commission, the accession of Ecuador to the existing Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru, which is a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and WTO-compatible agreement, reinforces the legal framework of the EU trade relations with this country and facilitates reciprocal trade and investment. Moreover, accession to the Trade Agreement will provide an anchor for Ecuador's economic reforms and efforts to integrate the global economy and increase welfare. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: foregone duty is estimated to amount to EUR 80 million upon full implementation of the Agreement after ten years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: an Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat between Denmark, Norway and Sweden was signed on 19 December 1966. It remained in force for an initial period of 35 years until 2002 and was subsequently extended for two five-year periods until 2012. This agreement allowed for reciprocal access between those three countries to fish up to 4 nautical miles from their respective baselines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat, which are the waters between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. It established that, for the purposes of such fishing, the area in question was deemed to constitute the high seas. In view of more recent developments in international fisheries law, Norway considered that the existing agreement was not in conformity with the current provisions of the Law of the Sea. Norway was particularly concerned with regard to the provisions on control. On 29 July 2009, the Norwegian Foreign Ministry formally informed the Danish authorities that they wished to terminate the Agreement with a formal denunciation. Consequently, the Agreement expired on 7 August 2012. Subsequently, Norway entered into formal negotiations with the Commission, on behalf of the European Union, with the aim of establishing a replacement Agreement on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak and Kattegat area. This new Agreement was signed on 15 January 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council conclude the Agreement between the European Union and Norway on reciprocal access to fishing in the Skagerrak for vessels flying the flag of Denmark, Norway and Sweden on behalf of the Union. The new Agreement: The measures proposed are designed in accordance with the objectives and the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and are consistent with the Union's policy on sustainable development."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (new proposal). PARLIAMENT’S ROLE: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 allows Member States to compensate 36 enumerated railway undertakings for the payment of obligations which undertakings of other transport modes do not have to support, such as special family allowances and pensions. When the rules for normalisation are correctly applied, such State support is considered compatible with the internal market and Member States are exempted from State aid notification obligations, Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 was adopted before the rail market was liberalised and when rail transport in Europe was developing primarily within national borders, with integrated companies both operating rail services and managing rail infrastructure. Today, this Regulation is inconsistent and incompatible with legislative measures currently in force, as well as with the fundamental principles laid down in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a single European railway area which include that: (i) railway undertakings shall be managed according to principles that apply to commercial companies; (ii) entities responsible for the allocation of capacity and charging for rail infrastructure shall be separate from entities which operate rail services; (iii) there shall be a separation of accounts; (iv) any railway undertaking licensed in accordance with EU criteria should have access to railway infrastructure on fair, non-discriminatory terms; and (v) that infrastructure managers may benefit from State financing. Regulation (EEC) In the context of a liberalised market where railway undertakings compete directly with the traditional monopolies listed in the Regulation, the Commission considers that it is not appropriate to discriminate between these two groups of undertakings. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission did not undertake an impact assessment. However, it requested information from Member States about application of the Regulation in May 2010 and in June 2011. Responses revealed that, between 2007 and 2010, a majority of Member States had not received applications from railway undertakings and had not made payments of compensation under the Regulation. A majority of Member States indicated they saw no ongoing need for the Regulation and some explicitly expressed their support for repeal or their opinion that the Regulation is obsolete or out of date. On the basis of the data provided by Member States, it was concluded that the impact of a repeal of the Regulation would be very minimal. LEGAL BASIS: Articles 91 and 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1192/69 to eliminate inconsistencies in the EU legal order and will contribute to simplification by eliminating a legal act which is now obsolete. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: there are no implications for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The Regulation is part of the EU's common visa policy for short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period. Suspension mechanism : the suspension mechanism in Article 1a of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 allows the temporary suspension of the visa exemption for nationals of a third country in certain emergency situations, as a last resort. It can be triggered by any Member State by notifying the Commission that it is confronted, over a six-month period, in comparison with the same period in the previous year or with the last six months prior to the visa liberalisation of that country, with circumstances leading to an emergency situation which the Member State in question cannot remedy on its own. These circumstances are namely a substantial and sudden increase in the number of: nationals of that third country found to be illegally overstaying in the Member State in question; unfounded asylum applications from the nationals of that third country, where such increase is leading to specific pressures on the Member State’s asylum system; rejected readmission applications submitted by the Member State to that third country for its own nationals. The Commission may decide that action is needed, taking into account the consequences of the suspension of the visa exemption for the external relations of the Union and its Member States with the third country concerned, while working in close cooperation with that third country to find alternative long-term solutions. In that case, the Commission has three months from the receipt of the notification to adopt an implementing act temporarily suspending the exemption from the visa requirement for the nationals of the third country concerned, for a period of six months. Before the expiry of this six-month period, the Commission must submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council. This report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to transfer the third country in question to the list of visa-required countries (Annex I), and thus to put its citizens permanently under the visa requirement. In such case, the temporary suspension of the visa waiver may be extended by a maximum period of 12 months. Migration crisis : in the context of the current migratory situation in the European Union and of the successful conclusion of several visa liberalisation dialogues with neighbouring countries (Georgia, Ukraine, Kosovo, Turkey), several Member States have questioned whether the existing visa suspension mechanism provides for the necessary flexibility to act in certain situations of urgency. In particular they have argued that: the possible grounds for suspension are too limited, and for instance do not include the failure of a third country to cooperate on readmission of third-country nationals having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the Union or a Member State and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation; the initiative to trigger the suspension mechanism by means of a notification, which in the Regulation lies solely with Member States, should be extended to Commission; the reference periods and the deadlines are too long, which does not allow for a fast reaction in emergency situations. Taking into account the Commission's recent proposals for visa liberalisation of Georgia, Ukraine, Turkey and Kosovo and the recent discussions with Member States, the Commission has decided to present a proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 to revise the current suspension mechanism. This is the aim of this proposal. CONTENT: the main objective is to strengthen the suspension mechanism by making it easier for Member States to notify circumstances leading to a possible suspension and by enabling the Commission to trigger the mechanism on its own initiative. This proposal for the revision of the suspension mechanism includes the following elements: The definition of the circumstances which Member States can notify to the Commission has been amended to clarify that the suspension mechanism cannot only be used in ""emergency situations, as a last resort"", but more generally in case the visa liberalisation leads to a serious increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications. The reference period for comparing this situation with the situation of the previous year or before visa liberalisation, is shortened from six to two months. It is sufficient for the increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications to be ""substantial"", whereas the increase must currently be ""sudden and substantial"". The grounds for possible suspension which can be notified should include rejected readmission applications for nationals of another third country having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the Union or a Member State and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation. Other salient issues : - the limitation in time (to seven years) of the possibility to compare the current situation with the situation before visa liberalisation is abolished; - the Commission is given the possibility to trigger the suspension mechanism on its own initiative if it has concrete and reliable information of any of the circumstances which Member States can notify or that the third country is – in a more general manner – not cooperating on readmission, in particular where an EU-level readmission agreement has been concluded with that third country. This failure to cooperate can, for instance, consist in: (i) rejecting or not replying to readmission applications, (ii) failing to issue travel documents for the purposes of return within deadlines specified in the agreement or not accepting European travel documents issued following the lapse of deadlines specified in the agreement, (iii) terminating or suspending the agreement. – Where the Commission, after having examined the circumstances notified (or of which it has received concrete and reliable information), decides that action is needed, the deadline for the adoption of the implementing act temporarily suspending the visa exemption for the third country concerned is reduced from three to one month. Territorial provisions : the proposed Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation, nor shall it be bound or subject to its application. The amended Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the Member States in accordance with the Treaties."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Science and Technology Centre ('ISTC') was set up in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It was funded together with other Parties (USA, Canada, and Japan) through an international multilateral agreement for the purpose of non-proliferation of scientific and technical expertise related to weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Over time, other Parties joined the Agreement, i.e. Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan, Republic of Korea, Norway, Russian Federation and Tajikistan. The ISTC works at the crossroads between scientific research and non-proliferation, and has funded almost 3000 projects with a total value of over EUR 550 million. The Union contribution amounts to approximately EUR 270 million. In the latest years the concept and the work of the ISTC as a science centre evolved to take into account the changing proliferation landscape, the results of threat analyses and the evolving needs of the parties. It increasingly focused on supporting projects aiming at mitigation of broader Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear risks, not necessarily focused on scientists' redirection, but on promoting bio safety and biosecurity, physical upgrades of laboratories as well as stimulation of networking activities among relevant scientific communities. Following the 2010 announced withdrawal of the Russian Federation, that becomes effective on 15 July 2015, the Parties agreed that a new Agreement needs to be put in place in order for the Centre to effectively fulfil its mandate under changed circumstances. On 21 October 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to start negotiations. The aims set out in the negotiating directives have been fully met. In accordance with the Council Decision (EU) 2015/1989 the Agreement continuing the International Science and Technology Centre between the European Union and Euratom acting as one Party and Georgia, Japan, Norway, the Kyrgyz Republic, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Tajikistan, and the United States of America was signed on 9 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council adopt a decision aiming to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement continuing the International Science and Technology Centre between the European Union and Euratom acting as one Party and Georgia, Japan, Norway, the Kyrgyz Republic, Armenia, Kazakhstan, Korea, Tajikistan, and the United States.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the proposal is made in the context of the implementation of the new Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which promotes in particular a sustainable, ecosystem-based and precautionary approach to fisheries management, emphasising the coherence between its internal and external dimension. Union fishing activities outside Union waters should be based on the same principles and standards as those applicable under Union law in the area of the CFP. Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 concerning authorisations for fishing activities (the ‘FAR Regulation’) deals with authorisations of Union vessels to fish outside Union waters and authorisations granted to third country fishing vessels to operate in Union waters. Together with Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (‘the Control Regulation’) and Regulation (EC) no 1005/2008 on illegal and unregulated fishing (‘the IUU Regulation’), it is one of the three implementing pillars of the CFP. The Commission considers that the Union should be able to monitor its fleet wherever it operates and whatever the framework. The current FAR Regulation needs to be revised to properly address the objectives of the new CFP and to provide consistency with the Control Regulation. In its Communication on the external dimension of the CFP in 2011, the Commission proposed a revision to the FAR Regulation as an integral part of the CFP reform. The European Parliament supported this initiative in a resolution adopted in 2012. Several developments at international level also support the need for a revision. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: amongst the 5 options considered, one option would combine legal certainty with broader scope, thus leading to a complete framework regulating the activity of the EU external fleet abroad. For this reason, this option has been considered as the most effective option for achieving policy objectives, ensuring legal certainty and contributing to the international credibility of the Union. CONTENT : the proposed regulation would repeal Regulation (EC) No 1006/2008 and sets out rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for Union fishing vessels operating in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country, under the auspices of a regional fisheries management organisation, in or outside Union waters, or on the high seas. The Regulation would also apply to third country fishing vessels operating in Union waters. The proposal aims to clarify the relationship to other rules dealing with authorisations, which may stem from the bilateral agreements or from the regional fisheries management organisations. These should be considered as special rules, whereas the present Regulation draws up the general framework. In the event of contradiction, the special rules should prevail. Fishing activities by Union vessels outside Union waters : the proposed regulation rests on the principle that every vessel should be authorised by its flag Member State before fishing outside Union waters, and by the coastal State when the activity takes place in its waters. The flag State should give this authorisation only if the eligibility criteria in the regulation are met, in any context. The responsibility of the flag State is central in this regard. A specific provision on reflagging allows the flag Member State to better identify when the reflagging operation indicates intended non-compliance that should prevent the authorisation being given. Traceability and proper follow-up of compliance history should be ensured throughout a vessel’s lifespan. The requirement that a unique vessel number be granted by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) should also serve this purpose. Fishing activities by EU vessels in third country waters : the proposal specifies the additional conditions to be met by Union vessels in order to fish in third country waters, be it under an access agreement or a direct authorisation. A central element is the prohibition on fishing under a direct authorisation when an access agreement is in force, unless otherwise provided for in its exclusivity clause, which reflects this principle in the agreements. The principle is that the Union needs to ensure that the activities of its external fleet do not undermine the sustainability of living marine resources within the waters of coastal states. In the case of a direct authorisation, the flag Member State should follow the best available scientific advice and a precautionary approach when authorising its vessels. The Commission is provided with all the relevant information and can intervene if it has doubts as to the compliance of the planned fishing operation with the Regulation. Reallocation of under-utilised fishing opportunities in sustainable fisheries partnership agreements: a reallocation system is important to preserve Union financial interests and ensure that no fishing opportunity that has been paid for is wasted. The proposal aims to clarify and improve the reallocation system, which should be a last resort mechanism. Its application should be temporary and it should not affect the initial allocation of fishing opportunities among Member States. Reallocation should only occur once the relevant Member States have given up on their rights to exchange fishing opportunities among themselves. EU fishing activities under Regional fisheries Management Organisations (RFMO): the proposal lays down the process for carrying out fishing activities under the auspices of an RFMO or on the high seas. The Commission may intervene if it believes the eligibility criteria are not being met. Besides, since some RFMOs also cover Union waters, Union vessels under the auspices of such RFMOs should fall under the scope of the proposed regulation. Chartering of Union fishing vessels: the proposal lays down rules on chartering, which is a particular form of direct authorisation and which has been difficult to monitor so far. The main objective is to provide a legal framework for this practice to be able to better monitor Union vessels fishing under a chartering agreement and to align EU legislation with the rules adopted by some RFMOs in this regard. Control and reporting obligations : the proposal covers the application of the Control Regulation to the activities of the Union external fleet and related obligations in terms of reporting, together with some specific obligations related to the external nature of the activities. Fishing activities by third country vessels in Union waters : the objective is to ensure that fishing activities taking place in Union waters are subject to the same rules independently of the flag of the vessel, while promoting a level playing field for Union operators and third-country operators in Union waters. Fishing authorisation register : the proposal aims to create a fishing authorisation register to better monitor the Union external fleet and increase transparency regarding these activities, with part of the register being publicly accessible. People should be able to know at any time which vessel is authorised to fish what and where. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States for the exception of Ireland, the United Kingdom, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. Georgia is currently listed in Annex I of the Regulation, i.e. among those countries whose nationals are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. The EU-Georgia Visa Liberalisation Dialogue was launched in June 2012. In February 2013, the European Commission presented the Georgian Government with an action plan on visa liberalisation (VLAP). The VLAP is structured around four 'blocks': document security, including biometrics (block I), migration and integrated border management, including asylum (block II), public order and security (block III), and external relations and fundamental rights (block IV). Before the start of the Visa Liberalisation Dialogue, the EU and Georgia had concluded in parallel a Visa Facilitation Agreement and a Readmission Agreement, which entered into force on 1 March 2011. Their full and effective implementation has been an underlying condition for the launch and the continuation of the visa dialogue. It is considered that Georgia has met all the benchmarks set out in the Visa Liberalisation Action Plan presented to the Georgian Government and therefore fulfils the relevant criteria for its citizens to be exempted from the visa requirement when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Georgia from Annex I (list of visa-required countries) to Annex II (list of visa-free countries). It shall also be specified that the visa waiver will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on the basis of negotiating directives adopted by the Council, the Commission has negotiated the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with a view to establishing a state of the art and privileged economic relationship with Canada. Canada is a strategic partner of the European Union and they have reached an ambitious agreement which will open up new opportunities for trade and investment for economic actors on both sides of the Atlantic. Both sides have also underlined through this agreement the importance of economic activity taking place within a framework of clear and transparent regulation defined by public authorities, and that they consider the right to regulate in the public interest as a basic underlying principle of the Agreement. The CETA negotiations were completed and initialled at the level of the Chief Negotiators on 1 August 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this comprehensive agreement on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt a Decision to conclude the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part. Aim of the Agreement: the CETA is a comprehensive trade and investment agreement which contains provisions on: Specific trade aim: CETA will significantly improve business opportunities for European companies in Canada. With CETA, European companies will receive the best treatment that Canada has ever offered to any trading partner, thus levelling the playing field on the Canadian market for EU companies. By opening markets, CETA should support growth and jobs in the EU and bring further benefits for European consumers. It has the potential to keep prices down and provide consumers with greater choice of quality products. CETA will not change EU standards. Standards and regulations related to food safety, product safety, consumer protection, health, environment, social or labour standards etc. will remain untouched. All imports from Canada will have to satisfy all EU product rules and regulations – without exception. Institutional component of the Agreement: the Agreement establishes a CETA Joint Committee that will continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of this agreement. The CETA Joint Committee is comprised of representatives of the European Union and representatives of Canada who will meet once a year or at the request of a Party and will supervise the work of all specialised committees and other bodies established under this Agreement. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the CETA will be the first to incorporate the new Investment Court System (ICS) in the context of the Investment Dispute Resolution System. Accordingly, an amount of EUR 500 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2017 onwards (subject to ratification) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal. It is estimated that foregone duty will reach an amount of EUR 311 million upon full implementation of the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 8 December 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, on the one part, and Canada, of the other part. The negotiations on the Agreement commenced in September 2011 and concluded in September 2014 with initialling of the Agreement. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Agreement on 28 October 2016, the Agreement was signed on 30 October 2016 at the 16th EU-Canada Summit. The present joint proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement. Note on legal basis: Article 218(6)(a)(iii) TFEU states that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council shall adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU states that the Council shall act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy and technical cooperation with developed countries. These aspects of the Agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for adopting a Union act. The Agreement establishes an institutional framework for cooperation between the EU and Canada. The legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 TEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Canada, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The aim of the Agreement is to strengthen existing cooperation between the Parties, which is based on the 1976 Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation, in order to cover political dialogue and common foreign and security policy-related issues, and a broad range of sectors including environment, justice and security, migration and integration, fisheries, education, culture, human rights, northern development and indigenous issues, youth exchanges and transport security. The Agreement (SPA) envisages several kinds of cooperation: Political cooperation: the aim of the SPA is to strengthen EU - Canada political ties and cooperation on foreign and security issues, and to advance cooperation on a large number of policy areas besides trade and economics. The Agreement enshrines EU-Canada common democratic values and will advance cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral level. The SPA will strengthen political dialogue in fields such as: It reaffirms the Parties' commitment to safeguarding international peace and security by preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and undertaking measures to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. Institutional cooperation: the SPA provides the mechanism for conducting political dialogue by organising annual summits at leaders level and consultations at ministerial level. It also establishes a Joint Ministerial Committee, which replaces the previous Transatlantic Dialogue, and a Joint Cooperation Committee with the objective of monitoring the development of the strategic relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement provides for the possibility of suspending its application in case of a violation of essential elements of the Agreement such as human rights and non-proliferation. In addition, the Parties recognise that a particularly serious and substantial violation of human rights or non-proliferation could also serve as grounds for the termination of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). The SPA, in conjunction with the CETA, is expected to provide tangible benefits and opportunities to the citizens of the EU and Canada."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with the Decision of the Council of 14 May 2012, a Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation (PCA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part, was signed on 30 April 2013, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Agreement should now be approved on behalf of the European Union. The PCA will supersede the current legal framework of the 1993 Agreement on trade and economic cooperation between the European Economic Community and Mongolia. The Commission notes that following the 11 June 2014 ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Case C-377/12 Commission v Council regarding the Council Decision on the signature of the PCA with the Philippines, this proposal should be based on Articles 207, 209 and 218(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: under this proposal, it is proposed that the Council approve, on behalf of the Union, the Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Mongolia, of the other part. Shared principles: the PCA is testimony to the growing importance of EU-Mongolia relations based on shared principles such as equality, mutual respect, mutual benefit, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It includes the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights, weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), the International Criminal Court (ICC), small arms and light weapons (SALWs) and counter-terrorism, and promotes bilateral, regional and international cooperation. Concrete cooperation: the PCA will allow the EU to assume greater responsibility and influence in the region, and to promote European values and provide the basis for more effective engagement by the EU and its Member States with Mongolia. It strengthens political, economic and sectoral cooperation across a wide range of policy fields, including trade and investment, development, justice, freedom and security. It encompasses areas such as: Institutional framework: the draft Agreement comprises institutional measures establishing a Joint Committee, composed of representatives of both sides at an appropriate high level, whose tasks shall be to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of this Agreement. Duration of the Agreement: this Agreement is valid for a period of five years. It shall be automatically extended for further successive periods of one year, unless either Party notifies the other in writing of its intention not to do so."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the 1979 World Trade Organisation (WTO) plurilateral Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft was adopted as part of the Tokyo Round. It entered into force on 1 January 1980 and it now has 32 signatories. This Agreement eliminates import duties on all aircraft, other than military aircraft, as well as on all other products covered by the agreement, in particular civil aircraft engines and their parts and components, all components and sub-assemblies of civil aircraft, and flight simulators and their parts and components. It contains disciplines on government-directed procurement of civil aircraft and prohibition of inducements to purchase, as well as on government financial support for the civil aircraft sector. The Annex to the Agreement lists the products that shall be accorded duty-free or duty-exempt treatment, if such products are for the use in civil aircraft or ground flying trainers and for incorporation therein, in the course of their manufacture, repair, maintenance rebuilding, modification or conversion. Products in the Annex of the Agreement are classified according to their respective tariff headings for customs purposes under the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (Harmonized System) developed by the World Customs Organization. Since the adoption of the ATCA, different versions of Harmonized System have been adopted. In November 2001, members adopted a Protocol Amending the Annex to the ATCA, transposing into the Annex the changes introduced in the 1992, 1996 and 2002 versions of the Harmonised System. Another revision of the Harmonized System took place in 2007. On 5 November 2015, after several years of discussions, the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft agreed to open for acceptance the revised Product Coverage of the 1979 Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft via the Protocol amending the annex to the ATCA. CONTENT: the Commission is presenting the Commission is submitting a proposal to the Council for a decision on the conclusion of the Protocol amending the Product Coverage Annex of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft. The protocol covers matters that fall under the common commercial policy and the amendment concerns a technical update of an international agreement without altering its scope or content. The new Protocol open for acceptance on 5th November 2015 by the WTO Committee on Trade in Civil Aircraft will modify the 2001 Protocol to make it compatible with the 2007 version of the Harmonized System."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner. To tackle climate change effectively and achieve the EU's long-term decarbonisation objectives to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, an important step was taken when the European Council agreed in October 2014 the 2030 policy framework for climate and energy. A centrepiece of the 2030 policy framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. To achieve this target cost-effectively, the sectors covered by the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) will have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005 while non-ETS sectors will have to reduce their emissions by 30% compared to 2005. The European Council confirmed that a well-functioning, reformed EU ETS with an instrument to stabilise the market would be the main European instrument to achieve this target. This proposal is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the Strategic Framework for the Energy Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment is largely based on the findings of the comprehensive impact assessment on the 2030 framework, focusing on certain ETS-specific methodological elements not already assessed. It includes (i) addressing the potential risk of carbon leakage, (ii) the establishment of a Modernisation and an Innovation Fund, (iii) optional free allocation to modernise the electricity sector in lower income Member States, as well as (iv) aspects building on the lessons learnt since 2013, such as the validity of emission allowances, guaranteeing a robust and secure registry and the continuation of the optional exclusion of small emitters. CONTENT : technological progress realised over time in the relevant sectors. Sectors deemed to be exposed to a risk of carbon leakage would continue to receive a higher allocation than others who have a higher ability to pass on relevant costs in product prices. maintains the Innovation Fund as a stepped-up effort to rapidly introduce new low-carbon technologies to the market enabling the EU to reach its long-term decarbonisation goals. Existing EU-level support for innovation is supplemented through dedicating 400 million allowances for these purposes. An extra 50 million allowances is added to this amount from the allowances that remain unused in 2013 to 2020 and would otherwise be placed in the Market Stability Reserve in 2020. establishes the Modernisation Fund and optional free allocation to the energy sector to contribute to the modernisation of the energy systems in lower income Member States. The Modernisation Fund is created with 2% of the overall quantity of allowances. These will be auctioned in accordance with the rules provided for in the EU ETS Auctioning Regulation to generate the necessary funds for projects to be carried out. The Commission also proposes that auction revenues should be used for climate financing actions in vulnerable third countries, including adaptation to the impacts of climate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: EUR 14,639 million - DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF Borders and Visa) for the period 2014 to 2020, as well as Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management became applicable as of 1 January 2014. The purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The instrument will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors. The aim of the draft Agreement with Liechtenstein (the associated country) is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Liechtenstein on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The draft Decision aims to conclude arrangements between the Union and Liechtenstein on this country's contribution to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa for the period 2014-2020 and on the supplementary rules necessary for this participation. This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part. Denmark shall decide within a period of six months after the Council has decided on this Decision whether it will implement it in its national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2007/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes requirements in relation to the exercise of certain shareholder rights attaching to voting shares in relation to general meetings of companies which have their registered office in a Member State and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market situated or operating within a Member State. The financial crisis has revealed that shareholders in many cases supported managers' excessive short-term risk taking. Moreover, there is clear evidence that institutional investors and their asset managers do not sufficiently focus on the real (long-term) performance of companies, but often on share-price movements and the structure of capital market indexes, which leads to suboptimal return for the end beneficiaries of institutional investors and puts short-term pressure on companies. The past years have highlighted certain corporate governance shortcomings in European listed companies. These shortcomings relate to different actors: companies’ and their boards, shareholders (institutional investors and asset managers) and proxy advisors. Five main issues have been identified : insufficient engagement of institutional investors and asset managers; insufficient link between pay and performance of directors; lack of shareholder oversight on related party transactions; inadequate transparency of proxy advisors; difficult and costly exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors. Stakeholders were consulted on two Green Papers (""Corporate governance in financial institution"" and ""The EU corporate governance framework""). Based on these consultations and further analysis, the Commission's Action Plan: European company law and corporate governance - a modern legal framework for more engaged shareholders and sustainable companies provides the Commission’s roadmap in the area, based the two objectives of enhancing transparency and engaging shareholders. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a range of options, including no policy change, have been considered to address each of the presented problems. The preferred option is the following: 1) mandatory transparency of institutional investors and asset managers on their voting and engagement and certain aspects of asset management arrangements; 2) disclosure of the remuneration policy and individual remunerations, combined with a shareholder vote; 3) additional transparency and an independent opinion on more important related party transactions and submission of the most substantial transactions to shareholder approval; 4) binding disclosure requirements on the methodology and conflicts of interests of proxy advisors; 5) creating a framework to allow listed companies to identify their shareholders and requiring intermediaries to rapidly transmit information related to shareholders and to facilitate the exercise of shareholder rights. CONTENT: the main objectives of the proposal are as follows: Improving engagement of institutional investors and asset managers : the proposal should increase the transparency of institutional investors and asset managers. They will be required to develop a policy on shareholder engagement, which should contribute to managing actual or potential conflicts of interests with regard to shareholder engagement. They should in principle disclose to the public their engagement policy, how it has been implemented and the results thereof. Where institutional investors or asset managers decide not to develop an engagement policy and/or decide not to disclose the implementation and results thereof, they shall give a clear and reasoned explanation as to why this is the case. Strengthening the link between pay and performance of directors : the proposal aims at creating more transparency on remuneration policy and the actual remuneration awarded to directors and creating a better link between pay and performance of directors by improving shareholder oversight of directors’ remuneration. Shareholders should have the right to approve the remuneration policy and to vote on the remuneration report. All benefits of directors in whatever form will be included in the remuneration policy and report. The proposal does not regulate the level of remuneration and leaves decisions on this to companies and their shareholders. Improving shareholder oversight on related party transactions : the proposal requires listed companies that related party transactions representing more than 5% of the companies’ assets or transactions which can have a significant impact on profits or turnover to submit these transactions to the approval of shareholders and may not unconditionally conclude it without their approval. For smaller related party transactions that represent more than 1% of their assets, listed companies shall publicly announce such transactions at the time of the conclusion of the transaction, and accompany the announcement by a report from an independent third party. In order to target only transactions that could be most disadvantageous for minority shareholders and to keep administrative burden limited Member States should be allowed to exclude transactions entered into between the company and members of its group that are fully owned by the listed company. Enhancing transparency of proxy advisors : the proposal will require proxy advisors to adopt and implement adequate measures to guarantee that their voting recommendations are accurate and reliable, based on a thorough analysis of all the information that is available to them and are not affected by any existing or potential conflict of interest or business relationship. Proxy advisors are required to publicly disclose certain key information related to the preparation of their voting recommendations. Facilitating the exercise of rights flowing from securities for investors : it is estimated that non-national shareholders hold some 44% of the shares in EU listed companies. The proposal requires Member States to ensure that intermediaries offer to listed companies the possibility to have their shareholders identified. Intermediaries should, on the request of such a company communicate without undue delay the name and contact details of the shareholders. The proposal also requires that intermediaries facilitate the exercise of the rights by the shareholder, including the right to participate and vote in general meetings and requires companies to confirm the votes cast in general meetings by or on behalf of shareholders."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union’s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aims to amend: (i) Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; (ii) Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators. It is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1994/62/EC on package and packaging waste; Directive 1999/31/EC on landfill waste. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‘fit for purpose’; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction – more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Directives 2000/53/EC, 2006/66/EC and 2012/19/EU in order to improve waste management in the Union, with a view to protecting, preserving and improving the quality of the environment, protecting human health, ensuring prudent and rational utilisation of natural resources and promoting a more circular economy. The proposed amendments aim to: simplify the permit and registration requirements for small establishments or undertakings; simplify reporting obligations : it is proposed to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce implementation reports every three years and use exclusively the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission; improve the reporting of statistics in order for the Commission to assess compliance with waste legislation across the Member States, by introducing a single entry point for all waste data, deleting obsolete reporting requirements, benchmarking national reporting methodologies and introducing a data quality check report. provide that, when preparing the reports on compliance with the targets set out in these Directives, Member States should be required to use the most recent methodology developed by the Commission and the national statistical offices of Member States."

CONTENT: the proposal to amend Directive 2008/98/EC responds to the legal obligation to review the waste management targets in that Directive to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy. The main points are as follows: Alignment of definitions : it is proposed to include in Directive 2008/98/EC definitions of municipal waste, construction and demolition waste, the final recycling process, and backfilling so that the scope of these concepts is clarified. The definition of municipal waste should be in line with the definition used for statistical purposes by the European Statistical Office and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. It is neutral with regard to the public or private status of the operator managing waste. Economic measures : Member States should put in place adequate incentives for the application of the waste hierarchy, in particular, by means of financial incentives aimed at achieving the waste prevention and recycling objectives of this Directive, such as landfill and incineration charges, pay as you throw schemes, extended producer responsibility schemes and incentives for local authorities. Waste or non-waste status : the proposal establishes at the Union level harmonised conditions for substances or objects to be recognised as by-products and for waste that has undergone a recovery operation to be recognised as having ceased to be waste. Producer responsibility schemes : given that the effectiveness of these schemes differ significantly between Member States, the proposal sets minimum operating requirements for extended producer responsibility. Those requirements should: define in a clear way the roles and responsibilities of producers of products placing goods on the market of the Union; define measurable waste management targets, in line with the waste hierarchy, aiming to attain at least the quantitative targets relevant for the scheme as laid down in the Directive; establish a reporting system to gather data on the products placed on the Union market by the producers subject to extended producer responsibility. Waste prevention : Member States should: encourage the use of products that are resource efficient, durable, reparable and recyclable; target products that are the main sources of raw materials of a high importance to the economy of the Union and whose supply is associated with a high risk to prevent that those materials become waste; encourage the setting up of systems promoting reuse activities, including in particular for electrical and electronic equipment, textiles and furniture; reduce waste generation in processes related to industrial production, extraction of minerals and construction and demolition, taking into account best available techniques; monitor and assess the implementation of the waste prevention measures. Prevention of food waste : Member States should take measures to promote prevention of food waste in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015, and in particular its target of halving food waste by 2030. These measures should aim to prevent food waste in primary production, in processing and manufacturing, in retail and other distribution of food, in restaurants and food services as well as in households. Member States should establish specific food waste prevention measures and should measure progress in food waste reduction. Re-use and recycling : Member States shall take measures: to promote preparing for re-use activities, notably by encouraging the establishment of and support for re-use and repair networks and by facilitating the access of such networks to waste collection points, and by promoting the use of economic instruments, procurement criteria, quantitative objectives or other measures; promote high quality recycling and set up separate collection of waste where technically, environmentally and economically practicable. Municipal waste : the proposal provides for an increase in the targets of preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste, from 60% until 2025 to 65% in 2030. Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of these targets. In the event of an extension, the Member State shall take the necessary measures to increase the preparing for re-use and the recycling of municipal waste to a minimum of 50% and 60% by weight, by 2025 and 2030 respectively. Bio-waste : Member States should ensure the separate collection of bio-waste where technically, environmentally and economically practicable. They should encourage the recycling, including composting, and digestion of bio-waste, the treatment of bio-waste in a way that achieves a high level of environmental protection. The proposal also provides for: the adoption of improved and simplified definitions and uniform calculation methods for recycling throughout the EU; the establishment of common rules for reporting in order to ensure the reliability of data gathered for recycling; introduction of an Early Warning System for monitoring compliance with the recycling targets; simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

The definitions in Directives 1999/31/EC should be aligned to those of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. Reduction in landfill waste: Member States should take the necessary measures to ensure that by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled is reduced to 10% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. Estonia, Greece, Croatia, Latvia, Malta, Romania and Slovakia may obtain five additional years for the attainment of the target. In the event of an extension, the Member State should take the necessary measures to reduce by 2030 the amount of municipal waste landfilled to 20% of the total amount of municipal waste generated. By 31 December 2024 at the latest , the Commission should examine the target with a view to reducing it and introducing restrictions to the landfilling of non-hazardous waste other than municipal waste. To this end, the Commission should send a report accompanied by a proposal, if appropriate, shall be sent to the European Parliament and the Council. The proposal prohibits the landfilling of biodegradable waste that has been separately collected."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers that recent trends suggest that turning waste into a resource is an essential part of increasing resource efficiency and closing the loop in a circular economy. The Union’s economy currently loses a significant amount of potential secondary raw materials that are found in waste streams. In 2013, total waste generation in the EU amounted to approximately 2.5 billion tons of which 1.6 billion tons were not reused or recycled and therefore lost for the European economy. It is estimated that an additional 600 million tons could be recycled or reused. By way of example, only a limited share (43%) of the municipal waste generated in the Union was recycled, with the rest being landfilled (31%) or incinerated (26%). With respect to waste management, the Union also faces large differences amongst its Member States. In 2011, while six Member States landfilled less than 3% of their municipal waste, 18 landfilled over 50%, with some exceeding 90%. This uneven situation needs to be redressed. The proposal aiming to amend Directive 94/62/EC on waste is part of a series of measures on the circular economy which also includes proposals to amend: Directive 2008/98/EC on waste; Directive 1999/31/EC on the landfill of waste; Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles; Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries and accumulators and waste batteries and accumulators; Directive 2012/19/EU on waste electrical and electronic equipment. The proposals build in part on the proposal that the Commission tabled in July 2014 and subsequently withdrew in February 2015. They are in line with the objectives of the Resource Efficiency Roadmap and the 7th Environment Action Programme including: full implementation of the waste hierarchy in all Member States; decline in absolute and per capita waste generation; ensuring high quality recycling and the use of recycled waste as a major, reliable source of raw materials for the Union. They also contribute to the implementation of the EU Raw Materials Initiative and address the need to prevent food waste. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment led to the conclusion that the options envisaged will bring the following benefits: reduction of the administrative burden in particular for small establishments or undertakings, simplification and better implementation including by keeping targets ‘fit for purpose’; more than 170,000 direct jobs could be created by 2035, most of them impossible to delocalize outside the EU; GHG emission reduction – more than 600 millions of tons of green house gas could be avoided between 2015 and 2035; positive effects on the competitiveness of the EU waste management and recycling sectors as well as on the EU manufacturing sector ; reinjection into the EU economy of secondary raw materials which in turn will reduce the dependency of the EU on raw materials imports. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the targets set by Directive 94/62/EC for the recovery and recycling of packaging and packaging waste to make them better reflect the Union's ambition to move to a circular economy. The main points are as follows: Recovery, recycling and reuse : the proposal provides for an increase in the targets for preparing for re-use and the recycling of packaging waste. Thus, Member States must take the necessary measures to fulfil the following targets: no later than 31 December 2025 a minimum of 65% by weight of all packaging waste will be prepared for reuse and recycled; no later than 31 December 2025 the following minimum targets by weight for preparing for reuse and recycling will be met regarding the following specific materials contained in packaging waste: 55 % of plastic; 60% of wood; 75% of ferrous metal, aluminium, glass, and paper and cardboard; no later than 31 December 2030 a minimum of 75% by weight of all packaging waste will be prepared for reuse and recycled; no later than 31 December 2030 the following minimum targets by weight for preparing for reuse and recycling will be met regarding the following specific materials contained in packaging waste: 75% of wood; 85% of ferrous metal, aluminium, glass, and paper and cardboard. The Commission may propose revised levels of the targets for plastics for 2030 based on a review of progress made by Member States towards reaching those targets, taking into account the evolution of the types of plastics placed on the market and the development of new recycling technologies and the demand for recycled plastics. Packaging waste exported from the Union : this may only be counted towards the attainment of the targets laid down by the Member State in which the packaging waste was collected if the certain requirements are met and if, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the exporter can prove that the shipment of waste complies with the requirements of that Regulation and that the treatment of waste outside the Union took place in conditions that are equivalent to the requirements of the relevant Union environmental legislation. Rules on the calculation of the attainment of the targets : the proposal provides for the adoption of harmonised methods of calculation for recycling rates throughout the EU. To ensure harmonised conditions for those calculations, the Commission will adopt detailed rules on the determination of recognised preparation for re-use operators and deposit-refund schemes and on the collection, verification and reporting of data. Member States should establish an effective system of quality control and traceability of the packaging waste. Reporting: in order to ensure the reliability of the data gathered on preparation for re-use the proposal sets out common rules for reporting. It lays down more precisely the rules according to which Member States should report what is effectively recycled and can be counted towards the attainment of the recycling targets. Early warning system : the proposal establishes an early warning system to detect shortcomings and allow taking action ahead of the deadlines for meeting the targets. The Commission shall draw up reports three years before each time-limit laid down. Simplification and streamlining of reporting obligations : it is proposed to repeal provisions obliging Member States to produce implementation reports every three years and use exclusively the statistical data which Member States report every year to the Commission. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only with Parliament’s approval. BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union. Consequently, it was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission has negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. Negotiations with Brazil resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 12 July 2016 in Geneva. CONTENT: in this proposal, the Council is asked to adopt a decision relating to the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the EU and Brazil pursuant to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union is approved on behalf of the Union. The Commission states that the results of the Agreement are as follows: As regards the volume of 78 000 tonnes allocated to Brazil under the EU tariff rate quota 'Raw cane sugar, for refining', notwithstanding the bound in quota rate of EUR 98 per tonne, the EU shall autonomously apply: The Commission will adopt implementing regulations to expand and manage the relevant quotas."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a comprehensive EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, was established by Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. This framework aims at facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles and trailers in the internal market by laying down harmonised requirements designed to achieve common environmental and safety objectives. Directive 2007/46/EC covers motor vehicles for the carriage of passengers (category M) and of goods (category N), and their trailers (category O), as well as their systems and components. As part of the commitments the Commission made in its CARS2020 Action Plan for a strong, competitive and sustainable European car industry, the EU type-approval framework for motor vehicles has been the subject of a comprehensive fitness check in 2013. Although the fitness check confirmed that the existing regulatory framework has its merits in meeting policy objectives, it has come under harsh criticism after the discovery that a German manufacturer (VW) had for several years used software to manipulate the emission performance of its cars. Within a week of the outbreak of the scandal, the Commission announced that it would reinforce the type-approval system, in particular by ensuring adequate supervisory mechanisms to ensure a correct and harmonised application of the type-approval procedures. Triggered by the outburst of the VW emissions scandal, the European Parliament adopted on 27 October 2015 a Resolution on emission measurements in the automotive sector, calling on the Commission for significantly strengthening the current EU type approval regime including more EU oversight, in particular with regard to market surveillance, coordination and follow up regime for vehicles sold in the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment of the VW emissions crisis on the review of the type-approval framework for motor vehicle. Already before the outburst of the VW crisis, the Commission was working on proposals to improve the type-approval legislation for motor vehicles, and identified main areas with a significant potential for improvement to better address the problems of unsafe and non-compliant automotive products. The assessment of the possible policy options resulted in the conclusion that regulatory action in these areas would be the most effective. The re-assessment of these policy options in the light of the VW crisis has highlighted the need to further increase their effectiveness in terms of detecting and preventing non-compliance problems. There is a warranted need for EU wide supervision to achieve a harmonised and co-ordinated enforcement based on commonly applicable criteria and uniformly applied by Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to replace Directive 2007/46/EC. It sets out the harmonised rules and principles for the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and the individual vehicle approval. The proposal aims to strengthen the existing type-approval framework, by introducing market surveillance provisions. It also contains a wide range of measures relating to: the traceability of products and role and responsibilities of economic operators in the supply chain; responsibilities of and co-operation between the different national authorities involved in the enforcement of the technical harmonisation legislation for motor vehicles; the quality of the type-approval and conformity assessment tasks carried out by technical services; the post-market safeguard procedures and the provisions for the recall of vehicles, procedures for ensuring conformity of production. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary implication of this proposal is estimated at EUR 40.104 million (including administrative expenditure) for the period 2017-2020. In view of the constraints of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, the implementation of the legislative proposal will have to be built on existing resources and to be designed in such a manner that additional financial resources under the EU budget are not needed. For the period following 31 December 2020, the amount shall be subject to the multiannual financial framework in force for the period commencing in 2021. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 82/891/EEC, Council Directive 89/666/EEC, Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council have been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, whilst stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, this proposal seeks to codify the following directives: Sixth Council Directive concerning the division of public limited liability companies (82/891/EEC), Eleventh Council Directive concerning disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State (89/666/EEC), Directive 2005/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies, Directive 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and third parties, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 48 of the Treaty, with a view to making such safeguards equivalent, Directive 2011/35/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning mergers of public limited liability companies, Directive 2012/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on coordination of safeguards which, for the protection of the interests of members and others, are required by Member States of companies within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The proposed Directive lays down measures concerning the following: the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States in respect of the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital; the coordination of safeguards which are required by Member States concerning disclosure requirements in respect of public and private limited liability companies; the disclosure requirements in respect of branches opened in a Member State by certain types of company governed by the law of another State; mergers of public limited liability companies; cross-border mergers of limited liability companies; the division of public limited liability companies. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the adoption and entry into force of international rules on liability for non-contractual damages arising from the carriage of hazardous and noxious substances (HNS) by sea is crucial in view of the significant share HNS cargo represents in maritime freight transport worldwide. The International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea, ('1996 HNS Convention') was aimed at ensuring adequate, prompt and effective compensation of persons who suffer damage caused by spills of hazardous and noxious substances, when carried by sea. The Protocol of 2010 to the 1996 HNS Convention contained necessary amendments to address problems identified in the 1996 HNS Convention. The 2010 Protocol and the provisions of the Convention, are to be read, interpreted and applied together as one single instrument. Neither the 1996 HNS Convention, nor the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention has entered into force. The latter has no contracting parties to it to this day. The 2010 Protocol, and thereby the consolidated 2010 HNS Convention, will enter into force 18 months after the date on which at least 12 States, 4 of which with no less than 2 million units of gross tonnage each, have ratified it, and the relevant data on contributing cargo have been submitted to the IMO Secretary-General showing no less than 40 million tonnes of cargo contributing to the general HNS account received in total in those States during the preceding calendar year. The main changes from the 1996 HNS Convention to the 2010 HNS Convention are: Given that issues related to judicial to judicial cooperation in civil matters do not apply to Denmark, the Council must adopt two separate decisions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: whilst no formal impact assessment was required, several options have been examined and weighed. The Commission considers that the conclusion of the 2010 Protocol to the HNS Convention will ensure: Using an international regime rather than regional solutions for these purposes better suits the nature of shipping as a global business. CONTENT: under the draft Council Decision, Member States would: State signature, ratification or acceptance of the 2010 Protocol nullifies any prior signature or ratification by that State of the 1996 HNS Convention. States ratifying the Protocol express their consent to be bound by the consolidated text of the 2010 HNS Convention, as a single, consolidated instrument for the Convention, which will take effect once the 2010 Protocol enters into force. When ratifying or acceding to the Protocol of 2010, Member States must inform the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organisation in writing that such ratification or accession has taken place in accordance with this Decision and the Decision adopted parallel to this Decision with regard to aspects falling within the competence conferred upon the Union in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the current EU regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices ('IVDs') consists of Directive 98/79/EC. It has demonstrated its merits but has also come under criticism in recent years. In an internal market with 32 participating countries and subject to constant scientific and technological progress, substantial divergences in the interpretation and application of the rules have emerged, thus undermining the main objectives of the Directive, i.e. the safety and performance of IVDs and their free movement. Triggered Resolution on defective silicone gel breast implants this revision of the current regulatory framework aims to overcome the flaws and gaps and to further strengthen patient safety. It aims to put in place a robust, transparent and sustainable regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that is 'fit for purpose'. The framework is supportive of innovation and the competitiveness of the in vitro diagnostic medical device industry and should allow rapid and cost-efficient market access for innovative IVDs to the benefit of patients and healthcare professionals. It should be noted that this proposal is adopted alongside a proposal for a Regulation on medical devices that are currently covered by the AIMDD and the MDD. While the specific features of IVDs and of the IVD sector require the adoption of a specific legislation distinct from the legislation on other medical devices, the horizontal aspects common to both sectors have been aligned. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Scope and definitions : to a large extent, the scope of the proposed Regulation matches the scope of Directive 98/79/EC, i.e. it covers in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The proposed changes clarify and extend the scope of the IVD Directive. They concern: ·  high-risk devices manufactured and used within a single health institution, which are subject to most of the requirements set out in the proposal; ·  tests providing information about the predisposition to a medical condition or a disease (e.g. genetic tests) and tests providing information to predict treatment response or reactions (e.g. companion diagnostics), which are considered as in vitro diagnostic medical devices; ·  medical software, which is explicitly mentioned in the definition of IVDs. To support Member States and the Commission in determining the regulatory status of products, the Commission may set up, in accordance with its internal rules, a group of experts from various sectors (such as IVDs, medical devices, medicinal products, human tissues and cells, cosmetics and biocides). Definitions: this section has been significantly extended, aligning the definitions in the field of in vitro diagnostic medical devices with well-established European and international practice. Making available of devices, obligations of economic operators, CE marking, free movement: t his chapter covers mainly horizontal issues similar for both medical devices and IVDs. It contains provisions that are typical for product-related internal market legislation and sets out the obligations of the relevant economic operators (manufacturers, authorised representatives of non-EU manufacturers, importers and distributors). It also provides clarification with regard to the adoption and the scope of common technical specifications (CTS) for in vitro diagnostic medical devices. The legal obligations on manufacturers are proportionate to the risk class of the devices they produce. The following concepts are new in the field of IVDs: ·  a requirement has been introduced that within the manufacturer's organisation a 'qualified person' should be responsible for regulatory compliance. Similar requirements exist in EU legislation on medicinal products and in the national laws transposing the Directive on medical devices in some Member States. ·  since in the case of 'parallel trade' with in vitro diagnostic medical devices application of the principle of free movement of goods varies considerably from one Member State to another and, in many cases, de facto prohibits this practice, clear conditions are set for enterprises involved in relabelling and/or repackaging IVDs. Identification and traceability of devices, registration of devices and of economic operators, summary of safety and performance, Eudamed: this chapter addresses one of the main shortcomings of the current system: its lack of transparency. It consists of the following requirements: Notified bodies : the proposal sets out requirements for national authorities responsible for notified bodies. It leaves the ultimate responsibility for designating and monitoring notified bodies, based on stricter and detailed criteria laid down in Annex VI, with the individual Member State . Any new designation and, in regular intervals, the monitoring of notified bodies are made subject to 'joint assessments' with experts from other Member States and the Commission, thus ensuring an effective control at Union level. At intervals. Classification and conformity assessment : the proposal introduces a new risk-rule based classification system, built on GHTF principles, which replaces the current list of IVD medical devices in Annex II to Directive 98/79/EC. In the new classification system, IVDs will be divided into four classes of risk : A (lowest risk), B, C and D (highest risk). The conformity assessment procedures have been adapted to match each of these four device classes. The proposal tightens and streamlines the different conformity assessment procedures during which the notified body audits the manufacturer's quality management system, checks the technical documentation, examines the design dossier or approves the type of a device. These are laid down in Annexes VIII to X. One conformity assessment procedure provided for under the IVD Directive (EC verification) has been deleted and the concept of batch testing has been clarified. The proposal also: ·  Clinical evidence: the proposal spells out the requirements for clinical evidence for in vitro diagnostic medical devices that are proportionate to the risk class. The key obligations are set out in Chapter VI while more detailed provisions are laid down in Annex XII. While most clinical performance studies follow an observational design and therefore the results obtained are not used for patient management and do not impact treatment decisions, specific requirements have been introduced in Annex XIII for the conduct of interventional clinical performance studies and other clinical performance studies where the conduct of the study, including specimen collection, involves invasive procedures or other risks for the subjects of the studies. The concept of 'sponsor' is introduced. The scope of the proposal remains restricted to clinical performance studies carried out for regulatory purposes, i.e. for obtaining or confirming regulatory approval for market access. Non-commercial clinical performance studies that do not pursue a regulatory purpose are not covered by this Regulation. Every interventional clinical performance study and other clinical performance study involving risks for the subjects of the study shall be registered in a publicly accessible electronic system which the Commission will set up. Vigilance and market surveillance : Governance : a central role in achieving harmonised interpretation and practice will be assigned to an expert committee (the Medical Device Coordination Group or MDCG) made up of members appointed by the Member States due to their role and experience in the fields of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices and set up by Regulation on medical devices. The proposal mandates the Commission to provide technical, scientific and logistic support to the MDCG. It empowers the Commission to adopt, where appropriate, either implementing acts to ensure uniform application of this Regulation, or delegated acts to complement the regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices over time. The future Regulation will replace and repeal Directive 98/79/EC."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2009 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and transparency, the aim of the proposal is to proceed with the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 207/2000 on the European Union trade mark. The new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. EU trade mark : the draft regulation establishes, at Union level, the modalities and the conditions for the grant of an EU trade mark. An EU trade mark shall have a unitary character. It shall have equal effect throughout the Union. The proposal also sets up a European Union Intellectual Property Office. The rights in an EU trade mark should not be obtained otherwise than by registration, and registration should be refused in particular if the trade mark is not distinctive, if it is unlawful or if it conflicts with earlier rights. An EU trade mark may consist of any signs, in particular words, including personal names, or designs, letters, numerals, colours, the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods, or sounds provided that such signs are capable of distinguishing the goods or services of one undertaking from those of other undertakings. Rights conferred by an EU trade mark : the proprietor of that EU trade mark shall be entitled to prevent all third parties not having his consent from using in the course of trade, in relation to goods or services, any sign where: the sign is identical with the EU trade mark and is used in relation to goods or services which are identical with those for which the EU trade mark is registered; the use of the sign means that there is likelihood of confusion on the part of the public, including the likelihood of association between the sign and the trade mark. The exclusive rights conferred by an EU trade mark should not entitle the proprietor to prohibit the use of signs or indications by third parties which are used fairly and thus in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Application: an application for an EU trade mark shall be filed at the Office. It shall contain: a request for the registration of an Î1 EU trade mark ; information identifying the applicant; a list of the goods or services in respect of which the registration is requested; a representation of the mark. The application for an EU trade mark shall be subject to the payment of the application fee. Where an application meets the requirements set out in the Regulation and where no notice of opposition has been given, the trade mark and the particulars shall be recorded in the Register. The registration shall be published, and the Office shall issue a certificate of registration. Duration and renewal : EU trade marks shall be registered for a period of 10 years from the date of filing of the application. Registration may be renewed for further periods of 10 years at the request of the proprietor, provided that the fees have been paid. The request for renewal shall be submitted in the six-month period prior to the expiry of the registration. Surrender, revocation and invalidity : an EU trade mark may be surrendered in respect of some or all of the goods or services for which it is registered. The rights of the proprietor of the EU trade mark shall be declared to be revoked on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim: if, within a continuous period of five years, the trade mark has not been put to genuine use in the Union ç in connection with the goods or services in respect of which it is registered; if, in consequence of acts or inactivity of the proprietor, the trade mark has become the common name in the trade for a product or service; if, in consequence of the use made of it by the proprietor, the trade mark is liable to mislead the public. An EU trade mark shall be declared invalid on application to the Office or on the basis of a counterclaim in infringement proceedings where there is an earlier trade mark in accordance with EU or national law. The decisions of the Office will be subject to appeal. EU certification marks : the Regulation states that such a mark shall be an EU trade mark which is described as such when the mark is applied for and is capable of distinguishing goods or services which are certified by the proprietor of the mark in respect of material, mode of manufacture of goods or performance of services, quality, accuracy or other characteristics, with the exception of geographical origin, from goods and services which are not so certified. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: mercury is recognised as a global threat to human health and the environment. Mercury is characterised by its transboundary nature. Global action is therefore necessary to ensure the protection of the individuals and of the environment within the Union as a complement to domestic measures. The Minamata Convention on Mercury, concluded under the auspices of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), is the main international legal framework for cooperation and measures to control and limit the use and anthropogenic emissions of mercury and mercury compounds to air, water and land. The Convention was adopted and opened for signature at a Conference of the Plenipotentiaries in Kumamoto, Japan, in October 2013. The European Union and twenty-one Member States signed the Convention on 10 October 2013 while Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia and Poland did so on 24 September 2014 and Malta on 8 October 2014. The EU has made significant progress for the last 10 years in addressing mercury domestically as a follow-up to the adoption in 2005 of the Community Strategy Concerning Mercury, as supported by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament in its resolution dated 14.3. 2006. The Strategy was reviewed in 2010 and was supported by the Council of the European Union. The Seventh Environmental Action programme established the long-term objective of a non-toxic environment and stated, for that purpose, that action is needed to ensure the minimisation of significant adverse effects of chemicals on human health and the environment by 2020. CONTENT: with the present draft Decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Minamata Convention on Mercury. The Convention addresses the whole life-cycle of mercury with the objective to protect human health and the environment. It: In parallel to this proposed Decision, the Commission has put forward a proposal for a Regulation by the European Parliament and the Council to transpose the limited number of provisions of the Convention that are not yet implemented into EU legislation."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa became applicable as of 1 January 2014. Furthermore, Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also became applicable on the same date. Under this Regulation, the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the Internal Security Fund (the ISF-Borders and Visa). The purpose of the ISF-Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. The ISF-Borders and Visa will serve to accomplish a key objective of the Schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an 'efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders'. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis. Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors, as the respective Association Agreements do not provide for such rules. The aim of the draft Agreement with Norway is to establish the arrangements of this participation and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: under this proposal, it is proposed that the Council adopt the Decision in which it is called upon to conclude, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and the Kingdom of Norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. Rules for the participation of Norway in the ISF-Borders and Visas: the Agreement provides for a number of technical provisions to establish the framework for participation. The funds allocated to Norway under the ISF-Borders and Visa shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. Protection of the financial interests of the Union against fraud is also stressed. Budgetary control: provisions are laid down as regards budgetary and financial controls. Member States shall be subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)) derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. Moreover, the Court of Auditors and OLAF shall be granted suitable access to carry out controls. Financial contributions from Norway to the ISF: provisions are also provided to guarantee the payments of the contribution from Norway to the ISF for the implementation of EU actions and its mid-term review and other specific actions. For the years 2016 to 2018, Norway shall make annual payments to the budget of the ISF-Borders and Visa in the order of EUR 19 777 712. Territorial application: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis. In this regard, the present Agreement with Norway also builds on the Schengen acquis. Denmark shall not take part in the adoption of this decision and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application. The same goes for the United Kingdom and Ireland."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may only adopt the act if Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) is the International Commodity Body (ICB) for cotton. Its mission is to assist governments in fostering a healthy world cotton economy. ICAC acts as a statistical observer and brings together producing, consuming, and trading countries and all segments of the cotton industry. It has an overall facilitating role. To date, the ICAC is one of the few ICBs1 where the European Union is not a member, whereas nine Member States have been members of the ICAC in their own right (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Finland, France, Italy, Netherlands, Poland and Spain). Membership of ICAC is in the interest of the Union, owing to the significance of cotton to the Union's economy. On various occasions (namely in its conclusions of 2004, 2008 and 2010), the Council of the European Union has requested the European Commission to consider EU membership of ICAC. It authorised the Commission in 2013 to negotiate, on behalf of the European Union and on the basis of negotiating directives, the accession of the Union to ICAC. CONTENT: with this draft decision, the Council is called upon to permit the EU to accede to the International Cotton Advisory Committee, on behalf of the Union. The Union will pay a contribution in line with the ICAC Rules and Regulations. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: ICAC membership is based on the payment of an annual contribution. It is calculated on an annual basis as a function of the number of ICAC's members (fixed part) and the volume of raw cotton traded by each member (variable part). A first contribution of maximum EUR 400 000 would be required, which will give the EU an appropriate influence in ICAC affairs and allow broad EU involvement in ICAC's activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the rapid take up of online content services and increasing use of portable devices, including across borders, means that Europeans today expect to use online content services from wherever they are in the Union (cross-border portability). However, when people travel in the EU, they frequently cannot enjoy such cross-border portability or can do so only to a limited extent. The absence of, or problems with, cross border portability of online content services in the EU results from the licensing practices of right holders and/or the commercial practices of service providers. Cross-border portability concerns online content services to which consumers have lawful access, or content that they purchased or rented online in their country of residence and to which they want to continue to have access when travelling in the EU. Consumer demand for the cross-border portability of online content services is substantial and expected to grow The Digital Single Market Strategy puts forward a range of initiatives with the objective of creating an internal market for digital content and services. This proposal is among the first of the initiatives under the strategy. The Commission considers that the proposal will have positive effects on competitiveness as it will help innovation in online content services and attract more consumers to them. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option, in addition to establishing a mechanism ensuring portability: (i) would impose an obligation on providers of online content services to ensure cross-border portability of such services and (ii) would establish that any provisions in contracts limiting cross-border portability would be unenforceable. This option would respond to consumers' expectations and the impact on industry is expected to be marginal because the portability of online content services does not extend the range of users of the service and as such does not challenge the territorial exclusivity of licences CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces a common approach to ensuring that subscribers to online content services in the Union, which are delivered on a portable basis, can receive these services when temporarily present in another Member State (cross-border portability). Definitions : the proposal contains definitions that will need to be interpreted in a uniform manner in the EU: a ""subscriber"" is defined as a consumer who, on the basis of a contract for the provision of an online content service, may access and use such service in the Member State of his or her residence; a ""consumer"" is defined as any natural person who, in contracts covered by the regulation, is acting for purposes which are outside his or her trade, business, craft or profession. ""Online content service"" is covered by the proposal when: (i) the service is lawfully provided online in the Member State of residence; (ii) the service is provided on a portable basis; (iii) the service is an audiovisual media service within the meaning of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council or a service whose main feature is the provision of access to works, other subject matter or transmissions of broadcasting organisations. Two scenarios are covered as regards online content services: (i) services which are provided for payment of money (directly or indirectly); and (ii) services which are provided without payment of money provided that the subscriber's Member State of residence is verified by the service provider. if a subscriber receives an online content service without payment of money, the provider will only be obliged to enable the subscriber to enjoy cross-border portability if the provider verifies the subscriber's Member State of residence; if, however, a consumer just accepts the terms and conditions of a free of charge online content service but does not register on a website of such service (and hence the provider does not verify the Member State of residence of such a consumer), the service provider will not be obliged to provide cross-border portability for such service. Cross-border portability of online content services : the proposal requires the provider to enable a subscriber to use the online content service while the subscriber is temporarily present in another Member State. This applies to the same content, on the same range and number of devices and the same range of functionalities as offered in the Member State of residence. However, this obligation does not extend to any quality requirements applicable to the delivery of such service when the service is provided in the Member State of residence. Nevertheless, if the provider expressly agrees to guarantee certain quality of delivery to subscribers while temporarily present in other Member States, the provider shall be bound by such agreement. In addition, the draft regulation will oblige the provider to inform the subscriber of the quality of delivery of the online content service when accessed and used in a Member State other than the Member State of residence. Localisation: the proposal sets out a mechanism establishing the localisation of the service for purposes of portability: the provision as well as the access to and use of the service by a subscriber who is temporarily present in another Member State is deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. For the licensing of copyright and related rights, this means that the relevant copyright acts, which occur when the service is provided to consumers on a basis of crossborder portability, are deemed to occur solely in the Member State of residence. Contractual provisions : the proposal renders unenforceable: any contractual terms contrary to the cross-border portability obligation, in particular those which limit either consumer's possibilities as to the cross-border portability of his or her online content services or service provider's ability to deliver it; any contractual terms contrary to the legal mechanism which enables service providers to comply with the cross-border portability obligation. However, right holders may require that the service provider makes use of means in order to verify that the service is provided in conformity with the regulation. The draft regulation also provides that: (i) the processing of personal data carried out within the framework of the Regulation shall be carried out in compliance with Directive 95/46/EC and Directive 2002/58/EC; (ii) the regulation shall also apply to any contracts concluded and rights acquired before the date of the application of the regulation if they are relevant for the provision of the service, the access to or the use of the service."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States of the one part and Ukraine, of the other part constitutes the basis of the relationship between the Union and Ukraine. Title IV on trade and trade-related matters is provisionally applied since 1 January 2016. In its preamble, the Parties to the Association Agreement have expressed their desire to strengthen and widen relations in an ambitious and innovative way. Taking account of the economic reform efforts undertaken by Ukraine, and in order to support the development of closer economic relations with the European Union, the measure aims at increasing the trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products and to grant concessions in the form of autonomous trade measures in selected industrial products in line with the acceleration of the elimination of customs duties on trade between the European Union and Ukraine. CONTENT: in order to increase the existing trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products from Ukraine into the Union, and to foster bilateral trade and economic cooperation with the Union, it is appropriate to grant additional autonomous trade preferences for Ukraine. The autonomous trade measures would be granted in the form of zero-tariff quotas for certain agricultural products in addition to the preferential tariff-rate quotas set out in the Agreement, and the partial or full removal of import duties on several industrial products. In order to increase the existing trade flows concerning the import of certain agricultural products from Ukraine into the Union, and to foster bilateral trade and economic cooperation with the Union, it is appropriate to grant additional autonomous trade preferences for Ukraine. The new autonomous measures would respect the same basic principles as those enshrined in the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Entitlement to benefit from the tariff-rate quotas shall be subject to: compliance with the rules of origin of products and the procedures related thereto; abstention by Ukraine from introducing new duties or charges having equivalent effect and new quantitative restrictions or measures having equivalent effect for imports originating in the Union or from increasing existing levels of duties or charges or from introducing any other restrictions from the day of the entry into force of this Regulation; respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law provided for in the Association Agreement. Normal safeguard procedures apply. The proposal confers implementing powers on the Commission enabling it to temporarily suspend the preferential arrangements established by this Regulation and to introduce corrective measures in cases where the Union market is affected by this Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Union will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to less than EUR 50 million annually with very limited impact on the EU’s own resources. The value of duties foregone on the importation of industrial products will count for approximately 20% of the total."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 laying down a uniform format for visas took over the design adopted by the Schengen states and sets out in its recitals that these documents have to contain all the necessary information and meet very high technical standards, notably as regards safeguards against counterfeiting and falsification. Since the introduction of the uniform format for visas, two substantial modifications to the initial Regulation have been adopted, which have contributed to the issuance of secure documents, fulfilling very high technical standards: the first amendment was introduced with Regulation (EC) No 334/2002 integrating a photograph produced according to high security standards as a first step towards the use of elements establishing a more reliable link between the visa sticker and the holder; the second amendment with Regulation (EC) No 856/2008 related primarily to an adaptation of the numbering in order to comply with the requirements of the Visa Information System (VIS). With the above mentioned modifications, high quality counterfeits have recently been detected in several Member States. It is therefore necessary to develop a new security concept with better security features for the visa sticker. The new common design should be established with more modern security features to render the visa sticker more secure and prevent forgery. For those reasons a physical document for the visa sticker will still be necessary for years to come. CONTENT: Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/951 laid down a uniform format for visas. The current visa sticker, which has been in circulation for 20 years, has to be considered as compromised in view of serious incidents of counterfeiting and fraud. Therefore, a new common model with more modern security features is proposed in order to render the visa sticker more secure and prevent forgery. The technical specifications for the production of the visa sticker are laid down in the new Annex to the amended Regulation. There are no substantive changes to the enacting term of this Regulation, only the Annex is replaced to show the image and the general description of the new visa sticker. The Annex to Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 is replaced by the text in the Annex to this Regulation. Transition period : to allow for using up existing stocks, a transitional period of six months is foreseen within which Member States can still use the old visa stickers. Moreover, in relation to the current visa sticker, further improvement of the overall security is necessary, without increasing the costs for the document itself. Territorial provisions : specific measures are laid down in the proposal for the implementation of the proposal by Ireland and the United Kingdom. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 is part of the Schengen acquis to which Norway and Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein are associated on the basis of their respective Association Agreements, the proposed amendment should also apply to them."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 168/2007 established a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights which became operational on 1 March 2007. The objective of the Agency is to provide the relevant institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union and its Member States, when implementing Union law. In order for the Agency to carry out its tasks properly, a Multiannual Framework is to be adopted by the Council every five years, determining the thematic areas of the Agency's work. The first Multiannual Framework covered the period from 2007-2012. The current Multiannual Framework (2013-2017) expires at the end of 2017. The Agency refers to fundamental rights as defined in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union. The Agency is not a legislative or a standard setting body. Its work is instrumental in providing data, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights issues to support evidence-based policy making across the EU, thereby also contributing to the development of a culture of fundamental rights in the EU. CONTENT: the objective of this proposal is to establish the Multiannual Framework for the Agency for Fundamental Rights for the years 2018-2022. Thematic areas: this proposal confirms the relevance for the next five year period of the thematic areas laid down for the Agency for 2013-2017. No theme is withdrawn. The Commission proposes to remove the exclusion of judicial cooperation in criminal matters and adding a reference to police cooperation. In addition, within the theme related to Roma integration, social inclusion aspects would be strengthened. The thematic areas proposed for the Multiannual Framework of the Agency for the years 2018-2022 are therefore the following: Complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies: the Multiannual Framework should include provisions with a view of ensuring complementarity with the remit of other Union bodies, offices and agencies, as well as with the Council of Europe and other international organisations active in the field of fundamental rights. The most relevant Union agencies and bodies in relation to this Multiannual Framework are: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any direct implication for the EU budget. The Agency will develop projects within the areas of its Multiannual Framework and within the human and financial resources in the Agency's annual budget as adopted by the budgetary authority. This will be detailed in the Agency's programming documents."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : the Commission considers that with current policies, GHG emissions are not expected to sufficiently decrease to reach the European Union's target of at least 40% reductions on 1990 by 2030 and, more specifically, a 30% GHG reduction in non-ETS sectors compared to 2005. Under current trends and with full implementation of existing legally binding targets and policies, emissions covered by the Effort Sharing Decision ('ESD') are only projected to decrease by around 24% below 2005 levels in 2030. Hence, national reduction targets, which provide the incentive for further policies driving deeper reductions, are required. The proposal is an important element of the strategic framework for the Energy Union. It aims to implement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (December 2015), which includes a long-term goal to keep the global temperature increase well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to below 1.5°C. The EU's climate objective is to reduce GHG emissions by 80-95% in 2050 compared to 1990, in the context of necessary reductions by developed countries as a group. In order to achieve the European Union's domestic long-term objective to cut emissions by at least 80% by 2050, continued progress is needed for a transition to a low-carbon economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment considered options for implementing the reduction in the non-ETS sectors other than the LULUCF sectors, building upon the current ESD and the guidance given by the European Council. The impact assessment looks at what the impact of the proposal would be on fairness, cost efficiency, and environmental integrity. CONTENT : the proposal lays down the minimum contributions of Member States to emission reductions for the period from 2021 to 2030 and the rules for determining the annual emissions allocations and those on evaluation on progress. The reductions aim to promote improvements, particularly in the sectors building, agriculture, waste management and transport. Annual emission levels for the period from 2021 to 2030: the proposal lays down Member States’ emission limits in 2030 as set in Annex I, and the rules on how emission levels are determined for 2021-2030: all Member States will have national emission targets for 2030 expressed as a percentage reduction from 2005 emission levels as well as access to new flexibilities to achieve those targets cost effectively. Collectively, these national targets give an overall EU reduction of 30% in the sectors covered by the proposal. The 2030 targets range from 0% to -40% compared to 2005 levels; the annual emission levels are determined based on a linear trajectory starting with average emissions for 2016-2018 based on the most recent reviewed GHG emission data. Annual emissions allocations (AEAs) in CO2 equivalent for each Member State for each year of the period will be set out in an implementing act ; different capacities of Member States to take action are recognised by differentiating targets according to GDP per capita across Member States. Flexibility instruments to achieve annual limits : the proposal sets out the flexibility available to Member States to achieve their annual limits including flexibility over time through banking and borrowing of annual emissions allocations (AEAs) within the commitment period, and flexibility between Member States through transfers of AEAs. In particular, two new flexibilities are introduced, which will allow Member States to reach their targets cost efficiently. One-off flexibility for certain Member States to access allowances from the EU Emissions Trading System : the new flexibility allows eligible Member States to achieve their national targets by covering some emissions in the non-Emission Trading System sectors with EU Emission Trading System allowances which would normally have been auctioned, generating revenue for that Member State; Flexibility to access credits from the land use sector (LULUCF): the proposal permits up to 280 million tonnes of CO2 to be credited from certain land categories to be used for national targets over the entire period from 2021-2030. The flexibility applies only to net credits generated at national level by deforested land, afforested land, managed cropland and managed grassland. Corrective action : if, based on the annual evaluation performed by the Commission, a Member State's progress deviates from its annual emission allocation, that Member State will need to prepare an action plan with additional measures to be implemented in order to ensure that it will comply with its obligations. Compliance check : the compliance check on GHG emissions from each Member State will take place every five years, and no longer annually, for each of the previous years of the period. Should a Member State be found to be non-compliant with its annual emissions allocations for any year of the period, corrective action in the form of the addition to the next year's emissions of a quantity equal to the amount in tonnes of CO2 equivalents of the excess emissions multiplied by a factor of 1.08 will apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited implications for the EU budget (EUR 3346 for the period 2017-2020). The indirect impacts on Member States’ budgets will depend on their choice of national policies and measures for GHG emission reductions and other mitigation action in sectors covered by this initiative. The proposal provides for continued annual reporting but with less frequent compliance checks. This will reduce the administrative costs for Member States. DELEGATED ACTS : the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT : Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT : Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND : in its 2009 Communication 'Kosovo – Fulfilling its European Perspective' the European Commission recommended examining the possibility of a Framework Agreement with Kosovo on the general principles of the latter’s participation in Union programmes, and on this basis preparing negotiating directives. The Council adopted the proposal for negotiating directives on 22 October 2012 and welcomed the Commission's on-going efforts to negotiate a Framework Agreement with Kosovo concerning its participation in Union programmes. Kosovo confirmed its agreement with the draft Framework Agreement in writing on 16 January 2013. It is now necessary to conclude the Agreement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : no impact assessment was undertaken. LEGAL BASIS : Article 212, in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT : the proposal states that Kosovo should be eligible to participate in the following Union programmes: The draft agreement contains provisions regarding the terms and conditions specifically applicable to the participation of Kosovo in each programme, particularly with regard to its financial contribution to the EU budget. It also provides that Kosovo's representatives should be allowed to take part, as observers and for the points that concern Kosovo, in the management committees responsible for monitoring the programmes to which Kosovo contributes financially.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in recent years, the challenge posed by corporate income tax avoidance has increased considerably and has become a major focus of concern within the Union and globally. The Commission in its communications entitled ‘Commission Work Programme 2016 - No time for business as usual’ and ‘Commission Work Programme 2015 - A New Start’ identified as a priority the need to move to a system whereby the country in which profits are generated is also the country of taxation. The Commission announced in March 2015, a comprehensive list of initiatives in its Action Plan on a Fairer Corporate Tax System and proposed as part of the subsequent Anti-Tax Avoidance Package (ATAP), to implement in the Union Action 13 of the OECD Action Plan endorsed by the G20 to fight base erosion and profit shifting (hereafter, BEPS). Responding to the calls from the G20 and elsewhere, greater transparency on the side of companies is needed to enable public scrutiny of whether tax is paid where profits are produced. The European Parliament in its resolution of 16 December 2015 on bringing transparency, coordination and convergence to corporate tax policies in the Union acknowledged that increased transparency in the area of corporate taxation can improve tax collection, make the work of tax authorities more efficient and ensure increased public trust and confidence in tax systems and governments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option identified in the impact assessment is the one concerning a public country-by-country reporting on worldwide operations broken down by EU Member State and aggregated for non-EU operations. In terms of societal benefits, this initiative responds to the increased demand for transparency regarding the tax affairs of multinational enterprise groups. By providing more information in a more convenient form, it should also contribute to increasing public trust in the fairness of the tax systems. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to amend Directive 2013/34/EU with a view to providing the tax administration with a complete set of information required to consider potential harmful tax practices rather than to provide the wider public with a general set of country-by-country data to improve transparency. It requires the multinational enterprises to disclose publicly certain items of the information submitted to tax authorities. Scope of the proposal : the proposal applies to all EU and non-EU MNEs with a consolidated turnover of at least EUR 750 million, having activities in the EU by way of at least an establishment. This is the same threshold as that set out in the OECD/BEPS and in the ATAP. According to the OECD, based on this threshold, only 10-15% of MNEs will be required to submit a CBCR; but the turnover of those MNEs will represent approximately 90% of the turnover of all MNEs. Small and medium-sized companies, who represent more than 95 % of all companies in the EU, are not affected by the proposal. For any MNE headquartered in a third country, the obligation will fall on its subsidiaries or branches in the EU unless the non-EU MNE makes the CBCR group report publicly accessible and indicates which subsidiary or branch in the EU is responsible for the publication of the CBCR on behalf of the ""parent"" company. Banking groups : where these are multinational enterprises which fall within the scope of this initiative, they will be exempted from the obligation to report on income tax information, provided that the report disclosed under Article 89 of Directive 2013/36/EU encompasses the activities of the ultimate parent undertaking in the EU and of all of its affiliated undertakings. Content of the report on income tax information : disclosed information includes: (i) the nature of the activities, (ii) the number of persons employed; (iii) the net turnover made (including with related parties); (iv) the profit made before tax; (v) the amount of income tax due in the country as a reason of the profit made in the current year; (vi) the actual payments made to the country's treasury during that year; (vii) the amount of accumulated earnings. In order to ensure a level of detail that will enable citizens to better assess how MNEs contribute to welfare in each Member State, the information should be broken down by Member State. In addition, because some third countries refuse to respect good governance standards in taxation and pose specific tax challenges, the information on operations of MNEs should also be shown with a high level of detail. Publication : the consolidated report on income tax information will be published in a business register with the objective of ensuring certainty and availability over time. Moreover, as the objective of this initiative is to enable public scrutiny, those reports will also be made accessible to the public on company websites. To allow for comparisons over time, reports will remain accessible for at least five consecutive years on the websites. Enforcement : enforcement of this initiative will be ensured with a combination of provisions. Member States should introduce collective responsibility of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies for these reports. The statutory auditor of any local subsidiary in charge will have to verify whether the CBCR has been provided and made accessible on the Internet. In the case of a branch of a third country multinational enterprises, that responsibility will be borne by those persons in charge of disclosure formalities. Lastly, Directive 2013/34/EU will apply, ensuring that infringements will be sanctioned by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for MNEs or their subsidiaries or branches. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. BACKGROUND: the European Union has already approved the Vienna Convention for the protection of the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol and the four previous amendments to the Protocol. At the 28th meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, which took place in Kigali, Rwanda, from 10th to 15th October 2016, the text of an amendment to that Protocol (the Kigali amendment) was adopted, adding a stepwise reduction of the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) to the control measures of the Montreal Protocol. A stepwise reduction of the consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons is necessary to reduce the contribution of those substances to climate change and to prevent their unlimited introduction, in particular in developing countries. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the adoption by the Council of a decision on the conclusion of the agreement to amend the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, adopted in Kigali on 15 October 2016. The text of the Kigali amendment divides countries into three groups based on when they should reduce the use of HFCs: the first group, which includes the most economically developed countries, must implement the first reductions in HFCs during the period 2019-2023 and undertake to reduce the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) by 85% by 2036, compared to the period 2011-2013 as a reference; a second group of countries will freeze its HFC consumption and production between 2024 and 2028 and commit to reducing its consumption by 80% by 2045; the remaining countries will freeze their consumption and production by 2028 and 2031. Together, countries will have to reduce HFC levels by 85% by 2047. The Kigali Amendment will enter into force on 1 January 2019, provided that at least 20 parties have deposited their instruments of ratification. The envisaged phase-down of HFCs is implemented through Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 that will have to be revised at a later stage in order to ensure compliance with the Kigali Amendment beyond 2030. Until 2030, the last year for which the Regulation determines a reduction step, the phase-down schedule is stricter than the future control measures under the Montreal Protocol."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Union is a party to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution as well as to the 1999 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-Level Ozone ('the Gothenburg Protocol'). The parties to the Gothenburg Protocol opened negotiations with a view to improving further the protection of human health and the environment, including through the establishment of new emission reduction obligations for selected air pollutants to be achieved by the year 2020 and the updating of emission limit values addressing emissions of air pollutants at source. In 2012, the Protocol was modified and two new annexes added. The Amendments set out in Decision 2012/1 entered into force and became effective on the basis of the expedited procedure provided for in the Gothenburg Protocol. The Amendment set out in Decision 2012/2 requires acceptance by the Parties to the Gothenburg Protocol. The Union has already adopted instruments on matters covered by the Amendment. This last one should now be approved. CONTENT: the Council draft seeks to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Amendment to the 1999 Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-Level Ozone, set out in Decision 2012/2 of the Executive Body of the Convention. The proposed Amendment to the 1999 protocol sets out new national emission reduction commitments for 2020 onwards. It covers four air pollutants: sulphur, nitrogen oxides, ammonia and volatile organic compounds (VOC) other than methane, and particulate matter. In particular, the amendment includes: (i) emission reductions for black carbon; (ii) an update of the emission limit values set in the annex to the protocol; (iii) new standards on the content of non-methane VOC's in products."

PROPOSED ACT: Joint Proposal for a Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Cuba are currently governed by the EU's Common Position 96/697/CFSP of 2 December 1996. On 10 February 2014, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to open negotiations for a Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement (PDCA) between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part. The negotiations began on 29 April 2014 and were concluded after seven rounds in March 2016. The Agreement was initialled on 11 March 2016 in Havana, in the presence of the High Representative and the Commissioner for International Development and Cooperation. The European Parliament was also kept informed throughout the negotiations. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve, on behalf of the Union, the Political Dialogue and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and it Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Cuba, of the other part is hereby approved on behalf of the Union. The Agreement should supersede Common Position 96/697/CFSP. The PDCA is the first bilateral agreement between the EU and Cuba. It aims to consolidate and strengthen links between the parties in the areas of political dialogue, cooperation and trade, on the basis of mutual respect, reciprocity, common interest and respect for their sovereignty. The relationship will be geared to supporting the modernisation of the Cuban economy and society, cooperating bilaterally and in international fora with a view to strengthening human rights and democracy, countering discrimination and achieving the sustainable development goals. The Agreement builds essentially on a three-pillar structure: The Agreement also establishes an institutional framework composed of a Joint Council and a Joint Committee and includes a provision on the fulfilment of obligations. The Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period and can be terminated at six months’ notice."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: according to the 2010 Commission report on the protection of the Union's financial interests, suspected fraud amounts to approximately 600 million euro annually on the revenue and expenditure side despite the legal framework in place. It can be assumed that the actual amount is even higher as not all cases are detected and reported. The damage to the EU budget calls for action to ensure equivalent and effective protection of the Union's financial interests, including criminal law as far as this proves necessary. Despite the development of an EU acquis in this area which includes fraud, corruption and money laundering, Member States have adopted diverging rules and consequently often diverging levels of protection within their national legal systems. According to the Commission, the actual common definition of offences in all Member States would reduce the risks of divergent practice, as they would ensure a uniform interpretation and a homogeneous way to meet all the necessary prosecution requirements. They would also strengthen the deterrent effect and enforcement potential of relevant provisions The proposal follows on from the Commission’s May 2011 communication “On the protection of the Union’s financial interests by criminal law and by administrative investigations” and the September 2011 communication “Towards a European criminal policy: Ensuring the effective implementation of EU policies through criminal law”. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission conducted an impact assessment of policy alternatives, taking into account the outcome of an external study which was completed in February 2012. The impact assessment concludes that a solution which in particular would extend the types of some fraud-related offences, introduce minimum sanctions and harmonise statutory limitation is to be preferred. LEGAL BASIS: Article 325(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal replaces the proposal for a Directive on the criminal-law protection of the Community's financial interests. It seeks to set out harmonised criminal law provisions in the field of the protection of the Union's financial interests, while allowing Member States a certain degree of flexibility as regards how to impose more stringent provisions. In particular, the proposal: introduces a definition of the Union’s financial interests (fraud in relation to VAT is considered as affecting the EU's financial interests and is therefore covered by this proposed Directive); provides a definition of fraudulent behaviour to be criminalised in the Member States; provides that dishonest conduct of tenderers in public procurement is to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of corruption to be criminalised in the Member States; provides for a definition of misappropriation, which covers conduct by public officials that does not constitute fraud in a stricter sense, and which consists in the misappropriation of funds or assets contrary to the purpose foreseen, with the intention to damage the Union's financial interests; makes reference to anti-money laundering legislation (Directive 2005/60/EC) with respect to money-laundering of the proceeds of the offences, so that such money laundering will be criminalised in the Member States; requires Member States to criminalise also forms of preparation of and participation in the offences of incitement, aiding and abetting, attempt; requires Member States to ensure liability of legal persons, while excluding that such liability is alternative to that of natural persons; requires Member States to apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions, in line with jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, and to set out a certain minimum set of criminal sanctions for natural persons; requires certain minimum imprisonment terms for particularly serious offences, based on thresholds set out for each offence; requires the existence of means of freezing and confiscation of proceeds and instrumentalities from these offences; requires the Member States to take the necessary measures to establish their competence bases in regard to criminal offences so as to allow the judicial authorities to initiate investigations, pursue prosecutions and bring to judgment cases relating to the Union's financial interests. BUDGETARY IMPACT: this proposal has no immediate budgetary implications for the Union. Its aim is, however, to prevent losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests by increasing deterrence and making enforcement by criminal law authorities of the Member States more effective, as well as to facilitate recovery in cases where losses caused by illegal activities affecting the Union's financial interests have already occurred."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Article 19 of the European Economic Area Agreement (EEA Agreement) contains provisions on trade in agricultural products. The 2007 EU-Iceland bilateral Agreement on trade preferences includes, among others, a commitment by the Parties to promote trade in products with geographical indications (GIs). The EU-Iceland GIs negotiations were conducted from 4 July 2012 to 17 September 2015. The negotiations were carried out in conjunction with the EU-Iceland negotiations on further liberalisation of trade in agricultural and processed agricultural products. The conclusion of the GIs Agreement with Iceland fits into the overall EU strategy of promoting the production and the consumption of EU products with GIs. CONTENT: the Commission proposed that the Council adopt a decision, approving on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on the protection of geographical indications for agricultural products and foodstuffs. Under this Agreement, 1 150 EU foodstuff GIs will obtain a high level of direct protection in Iceland. The GIs will be protected against: Iceland has not yet registered any protected GI names. The Agreement provides, however, a mechanism for updating the GIs list and for including new GI names at a later stage through a Joint Committee process The EEA Agreement already provides for the mutual recognition and protection of geographical indications for wines, aromatised wine products and spirit drinks. Therefore the scope of this Agreement covers only agricultural products and foodstuffs other than wines, aromatised wine products and spirit drinks. The GIs Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date on which the Parties have notified each other that their respective internal adoption procedures have been completed."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may only adopt the act with Parliament’s approval. BACKGROUND: the EU and Iceland are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement), which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the Parties will review efforts on the further reduction of any type of barriers to trade in the agricultural sector. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters entered into force on 1 January 2007. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations under Article 19 of the EEA Agreement in two years’ time. The bilateral agricultural trade agreement of 2007 increased the duty-free access of Icelandic agricultural products to the EU market to 51.9 % of trade and increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Icelandic market to 66.4 % of trade. These figures demonstrate that there was ample room for further trade concessions. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations that took place on 4 July 2012, aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products. The Agreement was initialled by the Parties on 17 September 2015. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Iceland concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. As a result almost 90 % of EU agricultural products will enter Iceland duty-free. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, fruit, vegetable and ornamental plants, additional tariff quotas or tariff reductions have been agreed upon. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Iceland will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."

To recall, the purpose of the ECAA is to open up markets between Europe and its neighbours and to offer ECAA signatories the benefits of an internal market in the field of aviation. In other words, the ECAA is a multi-lateral agreement offering full market opening in terms of access, capacity, fares and the freedom of establishment without nationality clauses as well as an alignment with Community legislation on safety, security and air-traffic management matters. Initial negotiations from 1996 onwards focused on the then ten applicant countries. Following their accession in May 2004, the Commission’s focus has shifted towards the Balkan region. The text of the multilateral agreement has been accepted by: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the European Community, Iceland, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Montenegro, Romania and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. Following extensive negotiations these countries have agreed to align their national aviation legislation with that of the EU’s. The Commission suggests that this development acts as a major step forward. In future air transport will play a key role in both the economic and political integration of Europe. Upon adoption of the proposed Council Decisions the existing bilateral air service agreements between the Member States and the ECAA partners will, to a large extent, cease to exist and be substituted by one single Community Agreement. In addition, the the text of the Agreement has been simplified. For instance, competition issues will henceforth be dealt with through the Stabilisation and Association Process. In terms of its structure, a common “multilateral main text” forms the basis of the ECAA. This text will be obligatory to all signatories. A series of Protocols have been added which accommodating the specific need of each country, including appropriate transitional arrangements. Lastly, an Annex lists all of the EU’s aviation acts applicable within the ECAA."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the strong growth in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the aviation sector risks undermining the EU's and global efforts to effectively tackle climate change. A centrepiece of the 2030 framework is the binding target to reduce overall EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% domestically below 1990 levels by 2030. The Union and its Member States have been endeavouring to advance international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas impacts from aviation since 1997 and they have legislation in place since 2008 to limit the climate change impacts from aviation activities through the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) that has been operating since 2005. In order to advance progress at the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the Union has twice adopted time-bound derogations to Directive 2003/87/EC on the EU ETS so as to limit compliance obligations to emissions from flights between aerodromes situated in the European Economic Area (EEA). In October 2016, ICAO agreed at its 39th Assembly on a Resolution for a global market-based measure (GMBM) to address the growth in international aviation emissions globally from 2021 through an offsetting system, aimed at enabling the aspiration goal of stabilising international aviation emissions at 2020 levels. In the absence of amendment to the existing legislation, the initial scope of the ETS (i.e. including extra EEA flights) would apply again. In view of the agreement on the GMBM at ICAO, the EU support towards its completion and timely operationalisation, and the EU's intended implementation of the GMBM from 2021 onwards, it is deemed necessary to review the EU ETS legislation. CONTENT: in response to the progress achieved by the 39th ICAO Assembly and to promote further momentum towards the successful implementation of a global market-based measure to address international aviation emissions from 2021, the Commission proposed to amend Directive 2003/87/EC establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading (EU ETS). Scope of the application of the EU ETS : it is proposed to extend the current approach to application of the EU ETS as set out in Regulation No. 421/2014 beyond 2016 until there will be sufficient clarity about the nature and content of the legal instruments adopted by ICAO for the implementation of the global market-based measure to allow the European Commission to carry out further assessments and review the EU ETS for the post-2020 period. Following the same approach as under Regulation (EU) No 421/2014 for the 2013-2016 period, the application of the EU ETS Directive to flights to and from outermost regions and third countries is derogated from after 2016, while flights between aerodromes in the EEA remain fully covered. Given that the scope remains as in 2016, the amount of free allocation received by aircraft operators will continue to be the same as in 2016 so, proportional to the intra-EEA activity, and the linear reduction factor applicable to all sectors under the EU ETS Directive will apply but only from 2021 onwards. Prepare for the implementation of a global market-based measure from 2021 : the proposal introduced a new provision that requires the Commission to report to the European Parliament and the Council on international developments of relevance for the implementation of the global market-based measure as well as on the actions taken by third countries to implement the measure. Thereby, the Commission is to consider ways to implement the relevant ICAO instruments in Union law through a revision of the EU ETS Directive. This may be accompanied with legislative proposals as appropriate. Annex I : Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC is amended by extending the exemption for non-commercial aircraft operators emitting less than 1 000 tonnes CO2 per annum from 2020 until 2030. The exemption reduced the number of aircraft operators regulated by Member States by around 2200 representing only 0.2% of emissions. Delegated acts : in order to prepare for the implementation of the global market-based measure, the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to provide for the appropriate monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions applicable to aircraft operators for the purpose of implementing the global market-based measure being elaborated in ICAO."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in LULUCF are currently covered by international obligations under the Kyoto Protocol only, up to 2020. Up to this date, the Kyoto Protocol places constraints on the EU and each of its Member States, as they need to ensure that the LULUCF sector does not yield extra emissions. However, the Kyoto Protocol will expire at the end of 2020. Consequently, governance for the LULUCF sector needs to be further developed within the EU. Currently, this is carried out under Decision No 529/2013/EU on accounting rules on greenhouse gas emissions and removals resulting from activities relating to LULUCF. Without a legal framework defining the applicable rules for the period post-2020, the way in which LULUCF would be included in the overall framework could be heterogeneous across the EU. The proposal is part of the legislation completing the integrated framework for climate and energy policies up to 2030 endorsed by the European Council in October 2014, to achieve the EU 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least -40% compared to 1990 levels domestically in a cost effective manner and contribute to limiting global warming. It is part of the Commission's ten political priorities, and an important element of the strategic framework for the Energy Union. It also aims to implement the EU’s commitments under the Paris Agreement (December 1995) on climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: in the conclusion of the impact assessment, a stand-alone LULUCF policy pillar was identified as the preferred option. This would continue to be utilised together with the commitment by each Member State to ensure that the LULUCF sector should have no net emissions on their territory (no-debit rule). CONTENT: the proposal aims to define how the LULUCF sector will contribute to an EU-wide 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in non-ETS (emission trading scheme) sectors by 2030 compared to 2005. It lays down; the commitments by Member States towards meeting the greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment of the Union for the period from 2021 to 2030; accounting rules relating to emissions and absorption linked to LULUCF activity and to verification of Member States’ commitments. The mandatory scope is, in essence, forest land and agricultural land, and land for which the use has changed from or to these uses. The approach proposed discards the parallel Kyoto Protocol reporting framework and streamlines the system with the UNFCCC ""land-based"" reporting framework. The scope includes greenhouse gases CO2, CH4 and N2O. Furthermore, the proposal: provides that each Member State is to ensure that the LULUCF sector should have, after the application of the accounting rules specified in the Regulation, and taking into account the flexibilities, no net emissions on their territory (""no-debit rule""); lays down general rules to avoid double counting, to manage the transitions between land use categories and to account for each carbon pool, except those falling under a ""de minimis"" rule; outlines the specific accounting rules for land use changed from (deforested) and to (afforested) forest land; outlines the specific accounting rules for managed cropland, grassland and wetland, including categories of land changing from and to these categories; provides for accounting rules for managed forest land using a forest reference level to exclude the effects of natural and country-specific characteristics; lays down the accounting for harvested wood products; permits Member States to exclude emissions from natural disturbances (forest fire, pest invasion, etc.) from their accounts; provides for Member States to compensate for emissions from one land accounting category by removals from another land accounting category in their territory; outlines the requirements for Member States to ensure appropriate monitoring for accounting purposes, and establishes regular compliance checks by the Commission; amends Regulation No 525/2013/EU in order to ensure that the reporting requirements currently applying to LULUCF are continued within the framework of that Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited implications for the EU budget (EUR 1.668 million for the period 2017-2020). The Commission states that the indirect impacts on Member States’ budgets will depend on the choice of national policies and measures for greenhouse gas emission reductions and other mitigation action in the land use sector covered by this initiative chosen in each specific country. The proposal eliminates one (of the existing two) reporting frameworks, streamlining the process of accounting compared to that required under the Kyoto Protocol. This will reduce the administrative costs for Member States and the European Commission. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current design of the residence permit was adopted in 1997. Back in 2009, Member States considered that more sophisticated forgeries meant it was necessary to work on a new design for residence permits and decided to introduce more modern security features to improve the security features of residence permits. Regulation (EC) No 1030/2002, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 380/2008, lays down a uniform format for residence permits for third-country nationals. During the discussions, it became clear that Member States were not in favour of a completely harmonised document. They insisted on maintaining the list of ‘updated’ additional security features, which could be added to a common ‘uniform’ format if desired. They did not wish to change their systems but preferred to continue with a common ‘uniform’ card with an improved level of security and an updated list of optional (national) security features. ‘Uniformity’ only meant having a uniform design and some standard security features, to which optional national security features could be added. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a new common design for residence permits for third-country nationals with more modern security features in order to render the residence permits more secure and prevent forgery. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to replace the Annex to Regulation (EC) 1030/2002 by a new technical Annex containing the image and the general description of the new residence permit. Transitional period and implementation : to allow existing stocks to be used up, provision is made for a transitional period of six months during which Member States can still use the old residence permits. It is also provided that Member States must introduce the new residence permits nine months after the Commission adopts an implementing decision on the supplementary technical specifications."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission notes that the demand for accessible products and services is high and the number of citizens with disabilities and/or functional limitations will increase significantly with the ageing of the European Union's population. Taking into account demographic ageing, it is expected that in 2020 approximately 120 million persons in the European Union will have multiple and/or minor disabilities. An environment where products and services are more accessible allows for more inclusion and facilitates autonomy. Accessibility is at the heart of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which the EU is a party together with 25 of its Member States. It is one of the priorities of the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 that sets actions for the implementation of the UNCRPD at EU level. Accessibility prevents or removes barriers to the use of mainstream products and services. It allows the perception, operation and understanding of those products and services by persons with functional limitations, on an equal basis with others. Differences in legislation, standards and guidelines on accessibility exist and are very likely to increase as Member States develop new accessibility rules. National authorities, manufacturers and service providers face uncertainties concerning the accessibility requirements for potential cross-border services, and concerning the policy framework applicable for accessibility. Harmonisation of national measures on accessibility is being proposed as a necessary condition to put an end to the legislative divergence. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a preliminary screening showed that this EU initiative should only cover selected priority areas, where obstacles to the functioning of the single market were most visible and likely to increase or where action at European level would add more value. Regulatory intervention appeared to be the most efficient form of EU intervention for tackling current and expected problems in the functioning of the single market. CONTENT: the proposed Directive will provide for a common EU definition and implementation framework for accessibility requirements of certain products and services, so that the latter might benefit from free circulation on the internal market and ensure the full participation of persons with disabilities in society. The proposal is complementary to existing EU law addressing assistance to persons with disabilities or with reduced mobility like the regulation of passenger rights in all modes of transport (air, rail, waterborne, bus and coach). It also complements the proposal for a web accessibility Directive that covers in its scope only certain public sector websites. The main aspects of the proposal are as follows: Scope: the proposed directive aims to: harmonise accessibility requirements for a list of products and services , selected on the basis of the needs of industry and people with disabilities. It concerns particularly transport ticket machines and check-in machines, banking services, consumer terminal equipment, telephony and audio visual services, passenger transport services, e-books and e-commerce; use the same accessibility requirements to define and give content to the – already existing, but undefined – obligation of accessibility laid down in EU law, such as in the area of public procurement and the structural and investment Funds. Accessibility requirements and free movement : the proposed Directive ensures that all products and services complying with the accessibility requirements will benefit from free circulation on the internal market. It supports industry to address accessibility issues by using the same functional accessibility requirements to render operational the obligation to buy/fund accessible products and services as laid down in EU law. In line with the 'think small first' principle, light conformity assessment and safeguard clauses are introduced to protect economic operators from carrying a disproportionate burden or avoiding (the costs imposed by) the fundamental alteration of their products and services Implementation by Member States : the proposed directive: harmonises accessibility requirements at EU level for a number of products and services but does not prescribe in detail how the obligation to render a product or service accessible by complying with the defined accessibility requirements has to be achieved in practice. In case this still leads to obstacles in the internal market, the Commission can consider other options in the future to provide guidance to Member States such as standardisation or implementing measures; includes the option of using voluntary harmonised standards to provide presumption of conformity with the accessibility requirements; provides that Member States must transpose the Directive within two years after its entry into force at the latest; requires Member States to apply all measures, within six years after the entry into force of the Directive. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has very limited budgetary implications. The only operational costs relate to the preparation of the report on the application of this Directive, i.e. operational appropriation of EUR 0.2 million under the existing budget line, as well as administrative expenditure of around EUR 0.182 million per year after the adoption of the Directive for running the related committee meetings. This expenditure will be borne by internal redeployment and not entail an increase in funds."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in the framework of the common fisheries policy established by Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, multi-annual plans should contribute to achieving fishing at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield). The fisheries of the North Sea and adjacent areas are highly complex, involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, as well as Norway, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. The proposal presented by the Commission establishes a plan taking into account such mixed fisheries interactions. The Basic Regulation aims at solving the problems of overfishing and discarding fish. However, without additional legislation, the Basic Regulation could lead to under-utilisation of quota in the North Sea mixed fisheries and would not allow any exemptions from the landing obligation to be adopted after the three year discard plans have expired. Hence, if no appropriate measures are taken, the Basic Regulation might have negative economic and social consequences for the fishing industry in the coming years. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice (a single mixed fishery multi-annual plan for North Sea demersal fisheries), wherein FMSY (maximum rate of fishing mortality) is achieved by 2020 at the latest and stocks are rebuilt to within precautionary levels quickly is judged to be more effective than Option 1 (to manage using the Basic Regulation) to achieve the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP set out in Regulation 1380/2013. The plan will: ensure the sustainable exploitation of these stocks, by ensuring that they are exploited according to the principles of maximum sustainable yield and of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management; provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on stocks, mixed fisheries and other aspects of the ecosystem and environment; facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation. The proposal aims to replace the current plan for cod, as well as the plan for plaice and sole by bringing all multi-annual plans for the different demersal stocks into one regulation. The plan will apply to all Union fishing vessels irrespective to their overall length in fishing in the North Sea as this is in conformity with the rules of the CFP and is in line with the effect of the vessels on the fish stocks concerned. The proposed plan: requires the EU to set catch limits that restore and maintain fish stocks above levels that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); defines ranges within which catch limits can be set. Fishing opportunities in the higher part of the ranges will only be possible under clearly defined conditions and in line with the MSY approach; establishes safeguard measures for biomass based on the precautionary approach laid out in the Basic Regulation; obliges the EU to take swift action when the sustainability of any demersal North Sea fish stock is threatened; establishes the necessary framework for implementing regionalisation within the North Sea and provides for regional cooperation among Member States regarding the adoption of measures on the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for certain stocks; adopt thresholds above which catches of demersal stocks should only be landed in designated ports; does not include annual limits on fishing effort (the numbers of days at sea). There will be periodic evaluation (every five years) of the impact of the plan on the stock concerned based on scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the Council and the European Parliament. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal seeks to address the EU’s need for a stronger Europe when it comes to foreign policy to better contribute to supporting development and securing peace and prosperity in the world. The Commission stated that it is essential to support security sector actors, including the military under exceptional circumstances, in third countries in a conflict prevention, crisis management or stabilisation context is essential to ensure appropriate conditions for poverty eradication and development. Those actions are particularly necessary to ensure the protection of civilian populations in the areas affected by conflict, crises or fragility. The 2005 European Consensus on Development recognised the link between security and development. The United Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015, underlined the importance of promoting peaceful and inclusive societies both as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 16) and in order to achieve other development policy outcomes. In the Joint Communication entitled ‘Capacity building in support of security and development – Enabling partners to prevent and manage crisis’, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy reiterated the need for stable and secure societies in order to achieve development objectives The Council conclusions on Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) of 18 May 2015 called to explore options to: (i) enhance coherence and coordination between EU security and development actions, as well as to; (ii) improve the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development, notably in terms of financing instruments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concludes that an amendment of the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace (IcSP) would be the most appropriate and effective short-term option. It also explained that a comprehensive implementation of the CBSD initiative (i.e. including support to the military for defence-related purposes) would require combining a budgetary instrument (for development tasks) with another, possibly extra-budgetary, mechanism. CONTENT: the proposal aims to insert a new Article into Title II of Regulation (EU) No 230/2014 in order to extend the Union’s assistance under exceptional circumstances to be used to build the capacity of military actors. The specific objectives of the proposal are to: contribute to improving the capacity of partner countries to prevent and manage crises by themselves; contribute to improving the effectiveness of the Union’s development actions by working with all security actors, including the military, through the delivery of capacity building in support of security and development by the EU, as soon as possible, flexibly and comprehensively; contribute to ensuring the respect of the rule of law, good governance as well as enhanced civilian control and oversight over the military in third countries. Types of Union assistance : Union assistance may be used to build the capacity of military actors in partner countries under exceptional circumstances, in order to contribute to sustainable development and in particular to the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies. The type of activities that may be supported include capacity building programmes in support of security and development, including training, mentoring and advice, as well as the provision of equipment, infrastructure improvements and provision of other services. Union assistance shall not be used to finance: (i) recurrent military expenditure; (ii) the procurement of arms and ammunition; (iii) training which is solely designed to contribute to the fighting capacity of the armed forces. Exceptional circumstances : assistance shall only be provided in the following circumstances: where requirements cannot be met by recourse to non-military actors to adequately reach Union objectives under this Regulation; where the achievement of stable, peaceful and inclusive societies is denied by a serious threat to the existence of functioning State institutions, as well as to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or State institutions can no longer cope with this serious threat; and where a consensus exists between the country concerned and the international community and/or the European Union that the security sector, and in particular the military, are key for stability, peace and development, particularly in crises and fragile contexts and situations. When designing and implementing measures, the Commission shall: (i) promote ownership by the partner country; (ii) develop the necessary elements and the good practices required for ensuring sustainability in the medium and long term and; (iii) promote the rule of law and established international law principle. Monitoring and evaluation procedures : Union assistance may be provided through exceptional assistance measures and interim response programmes, thematic strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes. Thematic strategy papers shall provide a framework for cooperation between the Union and the partner countries or regions concerned. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in terms of cost, a budget of EUR 100 000 000 over the period 2017-2020 would be required. The initiative will be financed through redeployment within Heading IV of the general budget of the Union. No additional resources would be mobilised. Implementation will be governed by Regulation (EU) No 236/2014."

PROPOSED ACT: Joint Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the European Union (EU) and the Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries signed a strategic partnership at the first bi-regional summit of their heads of state and government in Rio de Janeiro in 1999. Since 1999, successive summits have ensured a steady intensification of political dialogue and progress on jointly tackling a wide range of issues including climate change, migration, the fight against illicit drugs, the promotion of human rights and gender equality, education and cultural issues, and in the fields of science and technology. At the Fifth EU-LAC Summit (Lima, 2008), leaders of both regions decided to consider the creation of a bi-regional foundation to foster debate on common strategies and action to strengthen the partnership and enhance its visibility. The EU-LAC Foundation was formally established in Hamburg in 2011 as a German civil law body, pending the possible conclusion of an international constituent agreement to convert it into an international organisation. Council Decision 2012/493/EU authorised the Commission to open negotiations for an international agreement on the creation of the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation, with the EU, its Member States and the LAC countries as members. Negotiations started in December 2012 and the European Parliament has been kept regularly informed throughout the negotiations. The High Representative and the Commission consider that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met, and that the draft Agreement can be submitted for signature and conclusion. CONTENT: the joint proposal constitutes the legal instrument for the conclusion of the Agreement establishing the EU-LAC International Foundation is hereby approved on behalf of the European Union. The aim of the Agreement is to establish the EU-LAC Foundation as an international organisation with legal personality under public international law. The Foundation can be seen as an instrument of EU common foreign policy because its activities contribute to the convergence of Member States' actions towards the Latin American and Caribbean region, ensuring that the EU is able to assert its interests and values in the framework of the partnership between the two regions. Specific activities of the Foundation contribute to the political dialogue between the EU and CELAC in areas such as global governance and the promotion of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The Foundation will also strengthen cooperation between the EU and LAC regions, fostering intercultural exchange, notably by facilitating and promoting participation by, and inputs from, civil society and other social actors. It will aim to: BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the conclusion of the Agreement will have no direct budgetary implications, as it will be on a voluntary basis. The Commission has made financial contributions to the Foundation since it was established under German civil law in 2011, most recently (through the Partnership Instrument) the sum of EUR 3 million for the two years from October 2015. Some LAC and EU countries, including Germany as host country, have contributed financially on one or more occasions."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: prosecuting offences against the EU budget is currently within the exclusive competence of Member States and no Union authority exists in this area. National law enforcement efforts remain often fragmented in this area and the cross-border dimension of these offences usually escapes the attention of the authorities. Despite the intensified efforts of Union bodies, such as Eurojust, Europol and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), coordination, cooperation and information exchange face numerous problems which are a major impediment to the effective investigation and prosecution of offences affecting the Union’s financial interests. As Member States' criminal investigation and prosecution authorities are currently unable to achieve an equivalent level of protection and enforcement, the Union not only has the competence but also the obligation to act. Article 86 of the Treaty provides the necessary legal basis for such a new Union-level prosecution system, the purpose of which is to correct the deficiencies of the current enforcement regime exclusively based on national efforts and add consistency and coordination to these efforts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the analysis of the Impact Assessment, setting up the European Public Prosecutor’s Office as a decentralised integrated office of the Union, which relies on national judicial systems, offers the most benefits and generates the lowest costs. LEGAL BASIS: Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). CONTENT: this proposal seeks to create a European Public Prosecutor’s Office, as well as to lay down its competences and procedures. It complements a previous legislative proposal which defines which defines the criminal offences as well as the applicable sanctions. The main elements of the proposed Regulation are the following: Status, organisation and structure: the proposal provides for the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor’s Office in the form of a Union body with a decentralised structure and with legal personality and sets out its relationship with Eurojust. Independence: among the key features of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the text refers to its independence and accountability to the European Parliament, Council and the European Commission in regard to its activities. In this context, it lays down special rules on the appointment and dismissal of the European Public Prosecutor, his/her Deputies and European Delegated Prosecutors. Tasks and competence: the task of the European Public Prosecutor will be to combat criminal offences affecting the financial interests of the Union. It shall be responsible for investigating, prosecuting and bringing to judgment the perpetrators of, and accomplices in the criminal offences and for exercising the functions of prosecutor in the competent courts of the Member States in respect of the offences affecting the Union’s financial interests. The proposal lays down the applicable penalties that fall within the material competence of the European Public Prosecutor. These offences are to be defined by reference to national law implementing Union law. Basic principles: the proposal describes the main legal principles that will govern the activities of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, including conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, proportionality, national law being applicable to implement the Regulation, procedural neutrality, legality and celerity of investigations, Member States’ duty to assist the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. Rules of procedure on investigations, prosecutions and trial proceedings: the proposal covers the essential features of the investigations and prosecutions of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, including provisions on how they should be controlled by national courts, what decisions the European Public Prosecutor’s Office could take once the investigation is completed, how it would exercise its prosecution functions and how the evidence collected would be used in trial courts. Procedural safeguards: the proposal provides safeguards for suspects and other persons involved in the proceedings of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which will need to comply with the relevant standards, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. With regard to certain rights – right to interpretation and translation; right to information in criminal proceedings; right of access to a lawyer in criminal proceedings and the right to communicate upon arrest – the rules refer to Union legislation. The proposal also defines autonomously other rights which have not yet been regulated in Union legislation, such as the right to remain silent and the right to be presumed innocent, the right to legal aid, the right to present evidence, appoint experts and hear witnesses. As such, these rules provide an additional layer of protection compared to national law. The proposal also lays down the rules governing the data protection regime. The supervision of all personal data processing in the context of the activities of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office has been entrusted to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS). BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal seeks to be cost-efficient for the EU budget: part of OLAF's current resources will be used for setting up the central headquarters of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which in turn will rely on the administrative support of Eurojust. Limited additional costs will arise in relation to the position of the European Delegated Prosecutors who will be located in the Member States and will be an integral part of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. As the set-up phase of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office will probably take several years, staff members will be gradually transferred from OLAF to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The European Public Prosecutor's Office will reach cruising speed once the full staff levels are achieved. The full staff level will be achieved in 2023 with 235 staff, of which 180 establishment plan posts and 55 external staff. The estimated cost for 2023 with this staff level is approximately EUR 35 million."

CONTENT : the Euro-Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Morocco has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in December 2004. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, the text of the Morocco agreement was agreed ad referendum at the final negotiating round on 14 December 2005 on the occasion of the first Euromed conference of Transport Ministers held in Marrakech on 15 December 2005. The signature of the agreement is foreseen for the first half of 2006. Due to the advance status of the relationship between Morocco and the European Union, the Morocco agreement will result in the seamless integration of the Moroccan transport market into the single European market through a two-stage approach, always based on the three pillars of the aviation external policy: regulatory convergence (integration of the EC aviation regulations, participation in the Single European Sky) assorted with targeted technical assistance (through instruments such as the PAST), leading to the highest possible degree of market opening. This would result in an unrestricted commercial environment where operators are free to take commercial decisions, and where they operate under the highest standards in the areas of aviation safety, aviation security, environmental and consumer protection."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the conditions for making fertilisers available on the internal market have been partially harmonised through Regulation (EC) No 2003/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Virtually all product-types currently included in the existing Fertilisers Regulation are conventional, inorganic fertilisers, typically extracted from mines or chemically produced in line with a linear economy model. These processes are both energy consuming and CO2-intensive. Around 50 % of the fertilisers currently on the market are left out of the scope of the Regulation. This is true for a few inorganic fertilisers and for virtually all fertilisers produced from organic materials, such as animal or other agricultural by products, or recycled bio-waste from the food chain. As a result, fertilisers sourced in line with the circular economy remain non-harmonised. Their access to the single market is therefore dependent on mutual recognition between Member States, which is often difficult due to diverging national rules. Furthermore, the existing Fertilisers Regulation fails to address environmental concerns arising from contamination by EC-fertilisers of soil, inland waters, seawaters, and ultimately food. The ex-post evaluation of the existing Fertilisers Regulation conducted in 2010 concluded that the Regulation could be more effective in promoting innovative fertilisers, and that adjustments would also be needed to better protect the environment. The Commission proposes to establish harmonised conditions for making fertilisers made from recycled or organic materials available on the entire internal market in order to provide an important incentive for their further use. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment compared status quo (referred to as option 1) with four other policy options. Under the four options, the scope of harmonisation would be extended to fertilisers from organic raw materials and to other fertiliser-related products, and limit values would be introduced for contaminants. The final proposal corresponds with the option that would build on the 'New Legislative Framework' ('NLF'), with one conformity assessment procedure varying between material categories. This was considered to be the best policy choice because it would lead to administrative simplification, in particular for fertilising products from well identified, primary raw materials, and ensure flexibility, while at the same time ensuring that the use of harmonised fertilising products does not pose unacceptable risks to health or the environment. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal the existing Fertilisers Regulation and to address the problems identified in the evaluation conducted in 2010. It has also been identified as one of the key legislative proposals under the circular economy action plan. The main policy objective of the initiative is to incentivise large-scale fertiliser production in the EU from domestic organic or secondary raw materials in line with the circular economy model, by transforming waste into nutrients for crops. The draft regulation provides a regulatory framework radically easing access to the internal market for such fertilisers, thereby levelling their playing field with that of mined or chemical fertilisers produced in line with a linear economy model. This would contribute to the following circular economy objectives by: allowing valorisation of secondary raw materials, hence enabling improved use of raw materials and turning eutrophication and waste management problems into economic opportunities for public and private operators; increasing resource efficiency and decrease import dependency for raw materials essential to European agriculture, in particular phosphorus; boosting investment and innovation in the circular economy, hence creating jobs in the EU; contributing to relieving the fertilisers industry from its current pressure to reduce CO2-emissions under ETS, by allowing it to produce fertilisers from less carbon-intensive feedstock. A second policy objective is to address the issue of soil and food contamination and introduce harmonised cadmium limits for phosphate fertilisers . The Regulation introduces strict limits for cadmium in phosphate fertilisers. The limits will be tightened from 60 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg after three years and to 20 mg/kg after 12 years, reducing health and environmental risks. To achieve these objectives , the proposal: sets out the subject matter, scope and definitions, as well as the fundamental principles of free movement and marketability of CE marked fertilising products. The provision on product requirements are contained in the Annexes, which include the substantive requirements for the categories of end products in accordance with their intended function (Annex I), as well as for the categories of component materials that can be contained in CE marked fertilising products (Annex II). Annex III specifies the labelling requirements; lays down the obligations of economic operators involved in making CE marked fertilising products available on the market; sets out the general principle for conformity of CE marked fertilising products. It refers to Annex IV, which describes in detail the conformity assessment procedures applicable to CE marked fertilising products, depending on their component material categories and their product function categories.

DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in principle, the details of the implementation of the landing obligation are to be defined in regional multi-annual management plans adopted through codecision. Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 provides that, in the absence of multiannual plans or management plans, the Commission may adopt discard plans on a temporary basis and for a period of no more than three years. Experience has demonstrated that the preparation and adoption of multiannual or management plans that include discard plans takes longer than was envisaged at the time of the adoption of Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The first Commission delegated regulations establishing discard plans entered into force on the 1 January 2015 and are expiring at the end of 2017. To date, only the Baltic multiannual plan is in place, whereas two Commission proposals for a multiannual plan for demersals in the North Sea and for small pelagics in the Adriatic are currently under negotiation between the co-legislators. It is therefore appropriate to set the period for which the Commission may adopt discard plans in the absence of multiannual or management plans. CONTENT: the proposal contains only one substantive provision, which amends Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 in order to temporarily extend the Commission's power to adopt discard plans by means of delegated acts for an additional period of three years, provided that there are no multi-annual plans in place for the sea basins concerned."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the ePrivacy Directive (Directive 2002/58/EC) ensures the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms, in particular the respect for private life, confidentiality of communications and the protection of personal data in the electronic communications sector. It also guarantees the free movement of electronic communications data, equipment and services in the Union. The Commission carried out an ex post evaluation of the ePrivacy Directive. It follows from the evaluation that the objectives and principles of the current framework remain sound. However, important technological and economic developments took place in the market since the last revision of the ePrivacy Directive in 2009. The Directive has not kept pace with technological developments, resulting in a void of protection of communications conveyed through new services. A Eurobarometer survey on ePrivacy was conducted throughout the EU. The key findings are the following: 78% say it is very important that personal information on their computer, smartphone or tablet can only be accessed with their permission; 72% state that it is very important that the confidentiality of their e-mails and online instant messaging is guaranteed; 89% agree with the suggested option that the default settings of their browser should stop the sharing of their information. This proposal seeks to update the legal framework. It aims at reinforcing trust and security in the Digital Single Market – a key objective of the Digital Single Market strategy. The draft Regulation also aligns the rules for electronic communications services with the new world-class standards of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option offers a measured reinforcement of privacy/confidentiality by extending the scope of the legal instrument to include new functionally equivalent electronic communications services and which protects against unsolicited communications and simplifies and clarifies the regulatory environment. CONTENT: this proposed new Regulation seeks to enhance protection of confidentiality of electronic communications by extending the scope of the legal instrument to include new functionally equivalent electronic communications services. Like the European Electronic Communications Code, this proposal also brings the Over-the-Top (OTT) providers in its scope to reflect the market reality. Confidentiality of electronic communications : the proposal: contains the key provisions ensuring the limited permitted purposes and conditions of processing such communications data: privacy will be guaranteed for both content and metadata derived from electronic communications (e.g. time of a call and location). Both have a high privacy component and, under the proposed rules, will need to be anonymised or deleted if users have not given their consent, unless the data is required for instance for billing purposes; addresses the protection of terminal equipment, by (i) guaranteeing the integrity of the information stored in it and (ii) protecting information emitted from terminal equipment, as it may enable the identification of its end-user; details the consent of end-users, where technically possible and feasible, consent may be expressed by using the appropriate technical settings of a software application enabling access to the internet. End-users who have consented to the processing of electronic communications data shall be given the possibility to withdraw their consent at any time and be reminded of this possibility at periodic intervals of 6 months, as long as the processing continue; imposes an obligation on providers of software permitting electronic communications to help end-users in making effective choices about privacy settings. Rights of end-users to control the sending and reception of electronic communications : with a view to protecting their privacy, the new Regulation proposed: the right of end-users to prevent the presentation of the calling line identification to guarantee anonymity; the obligation for providers of publicly available number-based interpersonal communication to provide for the possibility to limit the reception of unwanted calls; the regulation of the conditions under which end-users may be included in publicly available directories and the conditions under which unsolicited communications for direct marketing may be conducted. Supervision and enforcement of this Regulation : this shall be entrusted to the supervisory authorities in charge of the GDPR. The powers of the European Data Protection Board are extended and the cooperation and consistency mechanism foreseen under the GDPR will apply in case of cross-border matters related to this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2010/40/EU of the European Parliament and the Council on the framework for the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems in the field of road transport and for interfaces with other modes of transport (the ITS Directive) requires that specifications be adopted, through delegated acts, for actions in four priority areas. Since the entry into force of Directive 2010/40/EU, four delegated acts relating to priority actions of that Directive have been adopted by the Commission. They address in particular eCall and data sharing mechanisms facilitating the electronic data exchange between the relevant public authorities and stakeholders and the relevant ITS service providers. There is a need for further delegated acts regarding actions still to be addressed and belonging to the scope of Directive 2010/40/EU. Not extending the delegation of power to the Commission would endanger the EU-wide integrated and coordinated deployment of interoperable ITS in road transport and their interfaces with other transport modes. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to extend the delegation of power for an additional period of five years starting from 27 August 2017. This period should be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council oppose such an extension."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as set out in its 6 April Communication ""Towards a reform of the Common European Asylum System and enhancing legal avenues to Europe"", the migratory and refugee crisis exposed significant structural weaknesses and shortcomings in the design and implementation of the European asylum system, and of the Dublin rules in particular. The current Dublin system was not designed to ensure a sustainable sharing of responsibility for applicants across the Union. This has led to situations where a limited number of individual Member States had to deal with the vast majority of asylum seekers arriving in the Union, putting the capacities of their asylum systems under strain and leading to some disregard of EU rules. In addition, the effectiveness of the Dublin system is undermined by a set of complex and disputable rules on the determination of responsibility as well as lengthy procedures. In particular, this is the case for the current rules which provide for a shift of responsibility between Member States after a given time. It is clear that the Dublin system must be reformed, both to simplify it and enhance its effectiveness in practice, and to be equal to the task of dealing with situations when Member States' asylum systems are faced with disproportionate pressure. This proposal on the reform of the Dublin III Regulation is part of a first set of legislative proposals the Commission is presenting in the context of a major reform of the Common European Asylum System. These proposals include: this draft Regulation establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person; a draft Regulation which aims to extend the scope of the Eurodac Regulation to include the possibility for Member States to store and search data belonging to third-country nationals or stateless persons who are not applicants for international protection and found irregularly staying in the EU; a draft Regulation on the European Union Agency for Asylum which aims to strengthen the mandate of the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). A second stage of legislative proposals reforming the Asylum Procedures and Qualification Directives, as well as the Reception Conditions Directive is due to follow to ensure the full reform of all parts of the EU asylum system. CONTENT: this proposal is a recast of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third country national or a stateless person (""the Dublin III Regulation""). A summary of the main provisions is as follows: New fairness mechanism : a new automated system will allow for the registration of all asylum applications made in the EU and the monitoring on a daily basis of the number of applications made in each Member State. The new system will automatically establish when a country is handling a disproportionate number of asylum applications. This reference number is identified on the basis of a key, taking account of the country's population size, and the size of its economy. Once the fairness mechanism is triggered, all new applications in the Member State concerned are allocated to other Member States, after an admissibility check has been carried out, until the number of applications is back below the 150% level. The fairness mechanism will also factor in the effort being made by a Member State to resettle those in need of international protection direct from a third country. Criteria for the reference key : the reference key is based on two criteria with equal 50% weighting: the size of the population, and the total GDP of a Member State. The number of applications for which a given Member State is responsible and the numbers of persons effectively resettled by a Member State form the basis for the calculation using the reference key and threshold. NB: a Member State will also have the option to temporarily not take part in the allocation. In that case, it would have to make a financial solidarity contribution of EUR 250 000 to the Member State receiving an applicant for whom it would otherwise have been responsible under the fairness mechanism. Streamlined procedures : procedures will be streamlined, in particular through shorter time limits for the different steps of the determination procedure, transfers and access to the asylum procedure: take charge requests, asking another Member State to take over responsibility for an application, have to be sent within one month and a decision taken by the receiving country within one month of receipt of the request. No reply will be tantamount to accepting the request; requests from one Member State to another to take back an applicant for whom the latter is responsible and who has absconded ('take back requests') will be transformed into simple take back notifications. Such notifications have to be submitted within two weeks of registration and do not require a reply, only a confirmation of receipt. All Member States will be under a clear obligation to take back applicants they are responsible for; appeals against transfer decisions will be dealt with within 15 days; proper registration of all asylum applications in the EU should help detect multiple applications and prevent irregular secondary movements. Obligations for applicants : the new system introduces clear legal obligations for applicants: explicit obligation for applicants to apply for asylum in the Member State of first irregular entry or in the Member State where a person has stayed legally prior to the application for asylum. This will make clear that applicants do not have the right to choose in which Member State they submit their application. In case an asylum applicant does not comply with this new obligation, Member States must examine the application in an accelerated procedure; applicants will also be obliged to provide all relevant information for determining the Member State responsible for their claim in a timely manner and failure to comply will have proportionate procedural consequences, such as the preclusion of information submitted unjustifiably late; to discourage secondary movements, applicants will only be entitled to material reception rights in the country where he or she is required to be present, with the exception of emergency healthcare; an obligation for the Member State of application to check whether the applicant comes from a first country of asylum or a safe third country. The Member State making this admissibility check will be considered responsible for these applications. The Member State of application must also check whether the applicant comes from a safe country of origin or presents a security risk, in which case they have to examine the application through an accelerated procedure. Best interests of children and unaccompanied minors : under the new system, the rights of unaccompanied minors will be enhanced and the assessment of the best interests of the child reinforced. The proposal clarifies that the Member State where the minor first lodged his or her application for international protection will be responsible, unless it is demonstrated that this is not in the best interests of the minor. Appeals will be accelerated but will have automatic suspensive effects, meaning no transfers will be carried out while the appeal is ongoing. The rights of unaccompanied minors have been strengthened through better defining the principle of the best interests of the child and by setting out a mechanism for making a best interests of the child-determination in all circumstances implying the transfer of a minor. New safeguards for asylum seekers : reinforced family reunification : the right to family reunification of asylum seekers present on the EU territory will be reinforced and the scope will be extended to also include siblings of an applicant as well as families formed in transit, after leaving the country of origin but before arrival on the territory of the Member State; detention : under the new system, the detention period for the purpose of transfers has been significantly reduced, from six to four weeks. Review clause : the Commission will review the functioning of the fairness mechanism 18 months after entry into force of the Regulation and annually from then on in order to assess whether the objective of ensuring a proportionate sharing of responsibility between Member States and of relieving disproportionate pressure on certain Member States is met. This review will in particular verify that the threshold for triggering the mechanism is effective. Territorial provisions : the United Kingdom and Ireland may participate in this proposal, but are not required to do so, in accordance with the relevant Protocols attached to the Treaties. As regards Denmark, it has an opt out and does not participate in justice and home affairs measures. However, Denmark applies the current Regulation on the basis of an international agreement concluded in 2006. Under that agreement, Denmark may opt in to the recast Regulation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total financial resources necessary to support the implementation of this proposal amount to EUR 1828.6 million foreseen for the period 2017-2020. This would cover the transfer costs once the corrective allocation mechanism has been triggered for the benefit of a Member State, the establishment and operation of the IT system for the registration and automatic allocation of asylum applicants."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 25 June 2012, the Council adopted a decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part. Negotiations began in July 2012 and the Agreement was signed on 5 October 2016. Pending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and New Zealand, are provisionally applied. The Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and New Zealand, a partnership which is based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties. Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of the common foreign and security policy, the common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part. Accordingly, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. No additional provisions are required as legal basis CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and New Zealand, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The purpose of the Agreement is ‘to establish a strengthened partnership between the Parties and to deepen and enhance cooperation on issues of mutual interest, reflecting shared values and common principles, including through intensifying high-level dialogue.’ The content of the Agreement covers three pillars: - political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU; - cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as : - sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of: - Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU’s relations with New Zealand."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the Commission carried out, in 2016, a review of the total amounts allocated to Member States for the “Investment for Growth and Jobs” goal of cohesion policy for 2017-2020, The Commission presented in its communication of 30 June 2017 the results of this review to the Council and the European Parliament. The review indicated that: on the basis of the most recent statistics, there is a cumulative divergence of more than +/– 5 % between the total and the revised allocations in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Croatia, Italy, Cyprus, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom ; on the basis of its gross national income (GNI) per capita figures of 2012-2014, Cyprus will become fully eligible for support from the Cohesion Fund as of 1 January 2017. The review of the total amounts allocated also includes the decision to extend the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) to the years 2017 to 2020. The Council decided to extend the YEI until 2020 with an amount of EUR 1.2 billion in current prices for the specific allocation for the YEI, which needs to be complemented by at least EUR 1.2 billion from targeted ESF investment. Insofar as the revision had an impact on the annual breakdown of the allocations for the global resources by Member State under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and under the European Territorial Cooperation Goal as well as on the Youth Employment Initiative, it was implemented by Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1941. The total net effect of those adjustments is to increase the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion by EUR 4 billion. Regulation (EU) No 1303/2016 needs to be amended accordingly. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 includes: regulatory provisions regarding the review of the allocations of cohesion policy for the years 2017-2020; the decisions to transfer resources between categories and goals; the decision to extend the YEI to the years 2017 to 2020 and the decision to transfer some commitment appropriations of 2014 to subsequent years. In terms of the amendments proposed, the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for budgetary commitment will be EUR 329 978 401 458, of which: EUR 325 938 694 233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund and EUR 4 039 707 225 represents a specific allocation for the YEI. Accordingly, the Commission proposes to adjust: the resources for the Investment for growth and jobs goal and their allocation between less developed regions, transition regions, more developed regions, Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund and outermost regions; resources for the European territorial cooperation goal. Furthermore, an amount of EUR 9 446 050 652 in current prices of the allocation provided for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund which could not be committed in 2014 nor carried over to 2015 will be transferred to subsequent years.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the development of digital technologies and internet has transformed the distribution of and access to television and radio programmes, with 49% of European internet users (Eurostat estimate) accessing music, audiovisual content and games online. Broadcasters and retransmission service providers are increasingly investing in the development of digital and online services for the distribution of radio and television programmes. However, despite the growing variety of online services, broadcasters’ programmes often remain unavailable online to European citizens living in other Member States. In addition, the variety of TV and radio channels from other Member States provided by retransmission services differs across the EU. Broadcasting organisations transmit on a daily basis a high number of programmes that they license from others or produce themselves. These programmes incorporate a variety of protected content such as audiovisual, musical, literary or graphic works. This requires a complex clearance of rights with a multitude of right holders. Operators of retransmission services, which aggregate a high number of TV and radio channels into packages, also face difficulties for acquiring all the rights necessary to retransmit the television and radio programmes of broadcasting organisations. The Satellite and Cable Directive does not extend to retransmission services provided by means other than cable over closed electronic communication networks, such as IPTV (TV/radio over closed circuit IP-based networks). This proposal responds to one of the key objectives identified in the Digital Single Market Strategy: to enhance wider online access to TV and radio programmes by users across the EU. It is presented in parallel with: a proposal for a directive to modernise certain aspects of the Union copyright framework to take account of technological developments; and a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the impact assessment examines two sets of policy options, aimed at facilitating the clearance of rights (i) for the online transmissions of TV and radio programmes; and (ii) for digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes: as regards online transmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application to broadcasters' online services which are ancillary to the initial broadcasts (notably simulcasting and catch-up services); as regards digital retransmissions of TV and radio programmes , the preferred option consists of limiting the scope of application of mandatory collective management of rights to IPTV retransmission services and other retransmission services provided over ""closed"" electronic communications networks, CONTENT: the draft regulation aims to promote the cross-border provision of online services ancillary to broadcasts and to facilitate digital retransmissions over closed networks of TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States by adapting the Union legal framework. The proposal defines the services covered by the measures (notably ""ancillary online services"" and ""retransmission"" services). These definitions will be applied in a uniform manner in the Union. The proposal concerns the facilitation of the clearance of rights for ancillary online services by broadcasting organisations by introducing a principle of country of origin, according to which the copyright relevant act takes place solely in the Member State where the broadcasting organisation is established. It also facilitates the clearance of rights for retransmission services provided over closed networks (other than cable), by introducing rules on mandatory collective management. By addressing the difficulties related to the clearance of rights, the proposal will promote consumers' access to more TV and radio programmes originating in other Member States, both as concerns ancillary online services of broadcasting organisations and retransmission services. The proposal provides that the Commission shall carry out a review of the Regulation and present a report on its main findings. It obliges Member States to provide the Commission with necessary information for the preparation of that report."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2014, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council codifying Council Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 establishing additional customs duties on imports of certain products originating in the United States of America. On 17 July 2015, in the light of the amendments made in the meantime, the Commission presented an initial amended proposal for codification of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 (see the summary dated the same day). Having regard to the amendments adopted in respect of Regulation (EC) No 673/2005 and in view of the work already carried out in the course of the legislative procedure, the Commission has decided to present another amended proposal for codification of the Regulation in question. CONTENT: the main elements of the new amended proposal are as follows: Additional rights : the amended proposal stipulates that the tariff concessions and related obligations under GATT 1994 of the Union are suspended in respect of products originating in the United States listed in Annex I to this Regulation. It provides the imposition of an additional 4.35 % ad valorem duty on products originating in the United States listed in that Annex. This duty would be in addition to the customs duties applicable under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the Union Customs Code. Annual adjustments : the Commission shall adjust the level of suspension annually to the level of nullification or impairment caused by the United States' Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act (‘CDSOA’) to the Union at that time. The Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty or the list in Annex I under the following conditions: the level of nullification or impairment shall be equal to 72 % of the amount of disbursements under the CDSOA relating to anti-dumping and countervailing duties paid on imports from the Union for the most recent year for which data are available at that time, as published by the United States' authorities; the amendment shall be made so that the effect of the additional import duty on imports of the selected products originating in the United States represents, over one year, a value of trade that does not exceed the level of nullification or impairment ($ 27.81 million); the Commission shall amend the rate of the additional duty when the level of suspension cannot be adjusted to the level of nullification or impairment by adding or removing products from the list in Annex I. Another amendment seeks to add the reference to Commission Delegation Regulation (EU) 2017/750 in Annex III. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. CONTENT: in June 2003, the European Community and its Member States were given a mandate to negotiate an Agreement with the United States of America for an “Air Transport Agreement”. The mandate was given following rulings by the European Court of Justice in November 2002 which stated that existing bi-lateral arrangements in the air transport sector were incompatible with EU law. Currently, there are twenty separate Agreements in place governing the laws and provisions of air operations between Europe and the US. The objective of the negotiations, therefore, was the establishment of an “Open Aviation Area” (OOA) between the EU and US. The idea being to create a single market for air transport between the EU and US in which EU and US airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction and which would include the domestic markets of both parties. Given the wide-ranging implications of such an Agreement, most notably the requirement for the US to remove restrictions on foreign legal ownership and control of US airlines cabotage, the Agreement became a politically sensitive issue for the US government. To address this problem both parties have agreed to a staggered implementation of the Agreement. At the same time, however, there is an implicit understanding that mechanisms should be put in place which allow the Agreement to become more complete. As a first stage, the EU has accepted that cabotage will not be included in the first Agreement. The EU has made clear to the US that this would only be acceptable if meaningful progress can be made towards the removal of restrictions on ownership and control of US airlines. As such the Council has stated that it will take particular notice of progress made by the US Department of Transportations and its pledge to re-interpret the statutory requirement that US airlines can only be under the “actual control” of US citizens. In other words, the adoption of this Decision by the Council will be subject to US adoption of rules deemed to constitute clear, meaningful and robust changes to the US’ policy vis-à-vis foreign ownership of its commercial air fleet. Depending on the speed with which the US confirms its commitment to re-assessing its current statutes, signature of the Agreement could take place in the first half of 2006. The Agreement represents a comprehensive first-stage agreement that will replace the existing bilateral agreements concluded by the Member States with the United States. It removes all existing restrictions on the rights of both Community air carriers and Unites States air carriers to operate between points in the European Community and points in the United States. Further, the Agreement established provisions which allow Community air carriers uniform conditions for market access; it establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation between the European Community and the United States and it establishes provisions essential to the safe, secure and efficient operation of transatlantic air services. There will be strengthened co-operation in matters concerning aviation security and aviation safety and there will be new arrangement for co-operation between the EU-US Competition authorities concerning the application of their respective competition regimes affecting the transatlantic market. All of the terms will simultaneously apply to the 25 EU Member States who will apply the same rules without discrimination and in a uniform manner. In return, Community air carriers will be able to access commercial opportunities, which Member States, acting individually, have been unable to secure. In short, adoption of the proposed Agreement will help enact one of the main objectives of the negotiations, namely the creation of a level playing field between all the EU and US air carriers, complemented by tight regulatory rules. The proposal has no implications for the Community budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: cap and trade systems are policy tools that cost-effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The European Union has been implementing its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS-EU) for more than ten years. The development of a well-functioning international carbon market through bottom-up linking of emissions trading systems is a long term policy goal of the EU and the international community, notably as a means to achieve climate objectives, including under the Paris Agreement. Linking enhances the cost-efficiency of emissions trading. The Directive establishing the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) allows for the EU ETS to be linked with other emissions trading systems provided they are mandatory, have an absolute cap on emissions and are compatible. In 2010, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Switzerland for a link between the EU and the Swiss greenhouse gas emissions trading systems. Overall, the design of the Swiss ETS is very similar to that of the EU ETS: the same gases and industry sectors are covered, with equal inclusion thresholds; definition of the liable entities at installation level; compatible allocation methodologies; similarity of quantitative and qualitative standards for international credits; same compliance periods (2013-2020). In addition, like the EU ETS, the Swiss ETS is currently undergoing review for its next period from 2021 to 2030. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the agreement between the EU and Switzerland on the linking of their greenhouse gas emission allowance trading schemes. In concrete terms, the agreement:"

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union (EU) and Kazakhstan are currently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement signed in Brussels on 23 January 1995, which entered into force in June 1999. On 13 April 2011, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the European Commission to negotiate the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Kazakhstan. Negotiation of the Agreement began in June 2011. The Agreement between the parties was signed on 21 December 2015, subject to its conclusion at a later date. For the EU, the Agreement constitutes an important step towards increased political and economic involvement in Central Asia. By strengthening political dialogue and improving cooperation in a broad range of areas, it will provide the basis for more effective bilateral engagement with Kazakhstan. Legal nature: the Agreement was negotiated and initialled by the European Union and the Republic of Kazakhstan as the Union's Agreement only. As the European Union's Member States were unanimous in preferring a mixed Agreement, it was agreed to amend the initialled text of the Agreement and the Joint Proposal from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission for a Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Agreement accordingly. In response to this measure, the European Commission made the following statement: ‘Given the political and economic relevance of the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (EPCA) with Kazakhstan, the Commission stresses the importance of signing and ratifying it swiftly. The Commission reiterates its position that a ""mixed"" agreement is legally unnecessary in the present case and that all matters covered by the agreement fall within the EU's competence. The Commission therefore regrets that the Member States insist on signing and ratifying the EPCA with Kazakhstan as a ""mixed"" agreement. The Commission reserves its position as to the future presentation of acts linked to the legal nature of an international agreement.’ Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Union, and provisional application of the Agreement, the Agreement was signed by the European Union and the Republic of Kazakhstan as a mixed Agreement. CONTENT: the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission jointly proposed that the Council adopt a Council Decision approving, on behalf of the European Union, the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Kazakhstan, of the other part. The text of the Agreement is attached to this Decision. The Agreement is based on three key points: – Political dialogue and cooperation in the field of foreign and security policy: provisions are provided to set the political dialogue with this country as well as cooperation in the field of foreign and security policy. The Agreement includes the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights, the international criminal courts, weapons of mass destruction, small arms and light weapons and counterterrorism. Provisions are also laid down as regards: - Trade and business: a specific title is provided for: The Agreement contains a substantive trade section with important commitments in several trade policy areas. These will ensure a better regulatory environment for businesses in Kazakhstan, and thus bring substantial economic benefits for EU businesses. - Sectoral cooperation: a series of provisions on cooperation are provided in a wide range of areas: - Institutional framework: the Agreement sets up an institutional framework comprising the Cooperation Council, the Cooperation Committee and the Parliamentary Cooperation Committee. It also introduces a procedure for settling disputes, to be used should one of the parties fail to fulfil its obligations under the Agreement. Duration of the Agreement: the Agreement is concluded for an unlimited period, and can be terminated at six months’ notice. As of its entry into force, the Agreement supersedes the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Kazakhstan, of the other part, signed on 23 January 1995."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides, inter alia, that authorisation schemes and certain types of requirements related to services must be non-discriminatory with regard to nationality or residence, justified by an overriding reason related to the public interest. To make sure that new measures imposed by Member States actually fulfil these conditions and thus facilitate the competitiveness and integration of the single market in services, the Services Directive provides that Member States shall notify to the Commission new or changed authorisation schemes or certain new or changed requirements falling under the Directive. Commission assessments have shown, however, that the current notification procedure under the Services Directive does not always achieve its objective. The Commission therefore presents a self-standing legislative instrument modernising the current notification procedure under the Services Directive in order to improve the enforcement of the existing provisions of that Directive. This proposal is included in the continuation of the Single Market Strategy. The European Council called for ambition in delivering the Single Market Strategy and for the different Single Market strategies to be completed and implemented by 2018. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice is a combination of options to use a legislative initiative to enable identified shortcomings to be addressed and establish an effective and efficient notification procedure with only a small increase in administrative costs for national public authorities and the Commission. CONTENT: the notification procedure established by the proposed Directive aims to ensure that certain national restrictions to the freedom of establishment and to the freedom to provide services will comply with the Services Directive, contributing to its better enforcement. Notification obligation : Member States shall notify to the Commission any draft measure that introduces new requirements or authorisation schemes, or modifies such existing requirements or authorisation schemes. The proposal also provides that Member States have to notify authorisation schemes, certain establishment requirements, certain requirements affecting the freedom to provide services and requirements concerning professional liability insurance and multidisciplinary activities. Consultation, alert and Decision : the proposal establishes a consultation period of three months following the notification of a draft measure. The Commission and other Member States have a maximum of two months to comment on a notified measure, followed by a maximum of one month for the notifying Member State to respond to such comments. The Commission may issue an alert to the notifying Member State where after assessing the notified measure it has concerns about its compliance with the Services Directive. The issuing of an alert implies that the Member State concerned shall not adopt the notified measure at issue for three months. After an alert has been issued, the Commission may adopt a legally binding Decision finding the notified measure to be incompatible with the Services Directive and requesting the notifying Member State to refrain from adopting it. Information to the public : the proposal provides for transparency to third parties of notified draft measures, accompanying information and the final adopted measures. In order to ensure an effective exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission, the Internal Market Information System set up by Regulation (EU) No 1024/2012 (IMI Regulation) of the European Parliament and of the Council should continue to be used under this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: pursuant to Council Decision 2012/130/EU the Union is a Contracting Party to the Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the South Pacific Ocean (the SPRFMO Convention), which established the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO), since 26 July 2010. Within the SPRFMO, the Commission of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation is responsible for the adoption of measures designed to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources through the application of the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries management, and, in so doing, to safeguard the marine ecosystems in which these resources occur. Such measures may become binding upon the Union. The conservation and management measures adopted by SPRFMO must be fully transposed into Union law and uniformly and effectively implemented within the Union. CONTENT: this proposal aims at transposing already existing SPRFMO conservation and management measures, binding upon the Contracting Parties. The Regulation shall apply to: the Union fishing vessels fishing in the SPRFMO Convention area or, in the case of transhipments, in the area outside the SPRFMO Convention area for the species caught in the SPRFMO Convention area; third country fishing vessels that access EU ports and that carry fishery products harvested in the Convention Area. The proposal refers to: management, conservation and control measures concerning certain species (SPRFMO management measures applicable to jack mackerel and seabird mitigation measures) ; management, conservation and control measures concerning certain fishing methods (bottom fishing and exploratory fisheries); common control measures : (i) authorisations for fishing vessels and the SPRFMO Record of Vessels; (ii) provisions on transhipment activities; (iii) data collection and reporting; (iv) surveillance and observer programmes; (v) inspection in EU ports of third country fishing vessels carrying fishery products harvested in SPRFMO; (vi) applicable procedure in case of apparent infringements during port inspections; (vii) rules on enforcement and compliance, notably the circulation of information on illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU) fishing activities, the implementation of measures vis-à-vis fishing vessels included in the SPRFMO IUU list and the management of compliance issues. Fishing opportunities for the EU decided by SPRFMO will not be covered by this proposal. In order to swiftly incorporate into Union law future binding amendments to the SPRFMO conservation and management measures, the power to adopt acts shall be delegated to the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: technical measures are rules governing how and where fishermen may fish. They aim to control the catch that can be taken with a given amount of fishing effort and also to minimise the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem. They concern: (i) measures that regulate the operation of the gear; (ii) minimum sizes below which fish must be returned to the sea; (iii) measures that set spatial and temporal controls to protect aggregations of juvenile or spawning fish; (iv) measures that mitigate the impacts of fishing gears on sensitive species or closed areas to protect sensitive habitats. The history of technical measures applying in European fisheries legislation within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is one of numerous regulations, amendments, implementing rules and temporary technical measures introduced as stop-gaps to resolve emerging problems. Across all Union sea basins and non-Union waters in which Union vessels operate there are more than 30 regulations which contain technical measures. With the new challenges of the new CFP, which came into force on 1 January 2014, the retrospective evaluation concluded that the current regulatory structure for technical measures will continue to be sub-optimal. This is because of five identifiable problems: sub-optimal performance : technical measures provide little incentive to fish selectively where there is no cost to discarding, or of catching sensitive species or impacting adversely on the seabed; difficult to measure effectiveness : the current regulations do not contain any defined metrics on which to measure success; prescriptive and complex rules : some measures are difficult for control authorities to enforce, and for fishermen to comply with; lack of flexibility : technical measures are mostly decided following a complex, inflexible and lengthy politically-driven process which is not well suited to defining detailed technical rules that need frequent updating and periodic review; insufficient involvement of key stakeholders in the decision-making process. These repeated failures to reach agreement on a new technical measures regulation clearly highlight the need for a new approach which aims to change the governance structure of technical measures rather than making wholesale changes to the measures themselves, the improved flexibility and incentives for fishing selectivity it introduces will deliver improvements in the effectiveness of technical measures. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred approach is that of a new framework Regulation containing a) general provisions (scope, objectives, guiding principles) and definition of the expected results and corresponding standards; b) common rules and technical provisions; and c) baseline standards (by region) corresponding to identified results which would function as default measures in the context of regionalisation. The preferred option largely presents changes to the regulatory structure and governance of technical measures. Few new measures are introduced and any changes to the substance are very much about deletion of rules in order to simplify and lessen administrative burden, improve controllability or consolidate nature conservation measures. CONTENT: the proposal has the following structure: Subject matter : the proposed Regulation lays down technical measures concerning: (a) the taking and landing of fisheries resources; and (b) the operation of fishing gears and the interaction of fishing activities with marine ecosystems. The proposal contains general provisions, overarching and specific objectives, targets linked to the general and specific objectives expressed in terms of levels of unwanted catches; thresholds for bycatches of sensitive species; and reduction in the extent of the seabed significantly affected by fishing; principles of good governance and definitions. The definitions relate primarily to the definition of fishing gears and fishing operations and are common to all regions. They consolidate and update the existing definitions contained in the existing Regulations. Common technical measures : the proposal contains common rules currently contained in all of the primary technical measures regulations but applicable to all sea basins and considered as de facto permanent as there is no need or justification for changing them. The provisions included under this part are: prohibited gears and practices including prohibition on the sale of marine species caught using certain gear types, measures to protect sensitive species (e.g. marine mammals, reptiles and seabirds) and habitats (e.g. coldwater corals) including those listed in the Habitats and Birds Directives; general restrictions on the use of towed gears and conditions for their use (covers basic codend construction and permissible attachments to fishing gears); restrictions on the use of static nets. This includes the consolidation of the existing restrictions on the use of driftnets (i.e. prohibition to use drift nets above 2.5km, prohibition on using such gears to target highly migratory species and the total prohibition on the use of driftnets in the Baltic). Under regionalisation Member States should strengthen these provisions up to and including the introduction of a total prohibition on the use of such gears where there is scientific evidence that shows the continued use of driftnets constitutes a threat to the conservation status of sensitive species in that region; minimum conservation reference sizes; common measures to reduce discarding. Regionalisation : regionalisation sets the general principles for regionalisation with reference to baseline measures which will apply where no regional measures are in places and establishes the empowerments needed for regionalisation of technical measures through multiannual plans, temporary discard plans and conservation measures necessary for compliance with obligations under environmental legislation. The regional measures that can be taken under temporary discard plans are also defined, as well as safeguards that will be taken if scientific evidence shows that the conservation objectives are not being met by the regional measures. To this effect, a safeguard clause is included that allows the Commission to act where available scientific advice indicates that immediate action is required to protect marine species. Such measures could include restrictions on the use fishing gears or on fishing activities in certain areas or during certain periods. Technical Measures in non-Union waters : the Commission may adopt delegated acts in respect of existing detailed rules concerning lists of vulnerable marine ecosystems and also specific technical measures related to defined fisheries for blue ling and redfish agreed by the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC). Annexes : the Annexes contain baseline measures by sea basin (i.e. North Sea, Baltic, Northwestern waters, Southwestern waters, Mediterranean, Black Sea and the outermost regions). These baseline measures will apply in the absence of measures being put in place regionally. There are also annexes containing a list of prohibited species that if caught as bycatches must be returned immediately to the sea; closed areas established for the protection of sensitive habitats and a list of species that are prohibited for capture with driftnets. Reporting : by the end of 2020 and every third year thereafter, the Commission will report on the implementation of this Regulation including an assessment of the impact of technical measures on the conservation of fisheries resources and on the environmental impacts of fisheries on marine ecosystems. On the basis of that report, the Commission will propose any necessary amendments. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 set up a Community regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering and transit of dual-use items. The Commission presented in October 2013 a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Regulation. The report concluded that the EU export control system provides solid legal and institutional foundations but the system must be upgraded in order to face new challenges. In April 2014, the Commission adopted a communication setting out concrete policy options for the review of the EU export control regime and its adaptation to rapidly changing technological, economic and political circumstances. In 2015, the Commission conducted an impact assessment of the review options outlined in that communication. As part of the impact assessment, the Commission conducted a public consultation, from which it emerged that’s stakeholders generally agreed that a review of current rules would improve the export control system, in particular with regards to its capacity to address evolving security risks such as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism and to respond to rapid scientific and technological developments. The export control policy review has been identified as an initiative under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT). Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 has been amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity and readability. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: besides the baseline scenario (no policy change), the impacts of four other scenarios were assessed. A combination of the options ""EU system upgrade"" (adjustments to the regulatory framework), and ""EU system modernisation"" (focusing on cyber-surveillance Technologies and human rights) was retained as the preferred solution. CONTENT: the proposal to recast Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 aims to set up a Union regime for the control of exports, transfer, brokering, technical assistance and transit of dual-use items. The main points are as follows; Control provisions : the proposal: contains amendments to key export control notions: the definition of dual-use items is thus revised to reflect the emergence of new types of dual-use items, such as cyber-surveillance technologies. The proposal also clarifies that controls apply to natural persons, who may be ""exporters"", especially when it comes to technology transfers; clarifies controls on and facilitates intangible technology transfers, as they only become subject to control when the dual-use technology is made available to a person in a third country; clarifies controls applicable to technical assistance involving a cross-border movement; strengthens brokering controls, (i) by extending the definition of the broker to subsidiaries of EU companies outside of the EU, as well as to brokering services supplied by third country nationals from within the EU territory; (ii) by harmonising their application to non-listed items and military end-uses and extending their application to terrorism and human rights violations; harmonises the application of transit controls to non-listed items and military end-uses, and extends controls to the risk of misuse for terrorist acts and human rights violations; puts in place certain controls an anti-circumvention clause to combat trafficking in items of dual usage. EU licensing : the proposal: provides for a definition of authorisations and for common licensing parameters (e.g. validity period) and conditions for use of the EU general authorisations and for global licences; establishes a new authorisation for 'large-projects' for certain large multiannual projects e.g. construction of a nuclear power plant; introduces new general authorisations regarding encryption and low value shipments to facilitate trade while ensuring a sufficient level of security through robust control modalities (e.g. registration, notification and reporting, and auditing); introduces a general authorisation on intra-company transfers of dual-use technology in non-sensitive countries, in particular for research and development purposes, as long as the technology remains under the ownership or control of the parent company. Convergence of catch-all controls : the proposal provides for a clarification and harmonisation of the definition and scope of catch-all controls to ensure their uniform application across the EU. Re-evaluation of intra-EU transfers : the proposal revises the list of items subject to control within the EU in order to focus controls on an updated list of most sensitive items, taking account of technological and commercial developments; Control of exports of cyber-surveillance technologies : the proposal sets out new provisions for an effective control focusing on specific and relevant cyber-surveillance technologies. It introduces an EU autonomous list of specific cyber-surveillance technologies of concern to be subject to controls (monitoring centres and data retention systems), with detailed technical parameters. Enhanced cooperation : the proposal provides for enhanced information exchange between competent authorities and the Commission with a view to support effective and consistent application of controls. It introduces a legal basis regarding the introduction of electronic licensing systems and their interconnection with the Dual-Use Electronic System, and for the setting up of 'technical expert groups' bringing together key industry and government experts into a dialogue on the technical parameters for controls. Transparency and outreach : the proposal sets out transparency measures and expands outreach and information-sharing with operators in order to develop a ""partnership with the private sector"". Dialogue with third countries : the proposal provides a basis for the development of regular dialogues between the EU and key trade partners, and for the negotiation of mutually beneficial measures such as end-user verification programmes (whereby selected third-country companies could be granted special status of ""Verified end-user"" and obtain EU-wide recognition and facilitation of controls). BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS : some specific provisions in the proposal are expected to have implications on the resources of relevant services at EU or national levels, in particular ; extended competence for the Commission to amend lists of dual-use items and general export authorisations by delegated acts ; cyber-surveillance controls expected to require some additional administrative costs (staff) for administrations, both at national and EU level; the realisation of certain actions – such as the development of electronic licensing systems – while the financing and budgetary implications remain to be assessed in detail before any decision is taken regarding their implementation. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU has long been worldwide leader in the development of renewable energy. The 2030 framework for climate and energy sets out the EU target of at least 27% for the share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030. If no new policies are put in place, EU energy system projections indicate that current Member States and EU policies would only lead to approximately, 24.3% of renewable energy consumption in 2030. This level would be well below the minimum 27% EU level binding renewable energy target. It would prevent the Union from collectively delivering on the commitments made in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Accordingly, the Commission indicates that reaching the EU level target of at least 27% calls for a change in policies in the form of a Union level framework leading to EU, national and regional level measures. The European Parliament called upon the Commission to present the renewable energy legislation and to increase even further the ambition level to at least 30%. This proposal is linked to the proposals the recast of the Third Energy Package (please refer to 2016/0379(COD), 2016/0380(COD), and 2016/0378(COD)). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considered it opportune to go ahead with a recasting proposal for the Renewable Energy Directive. In particular, it has opted for more proportionate and less burdensome provisions for the heating and cooling sector combined with strengthened provisions in the governance framework to safeguard the achievement of the 2030 targets. CONTENT : the proposed Directive identified six key areas for action: creating an enabling framework for further deployment of renewables in the electricity sector; mainstreaming renewables in the heating and cooling sector; decarbonising and diversifying the transport sector; empowering and informing consumers; strengthening the EU sustainability criteria for bioenergy; making sure the EU level binding target is achieved on time and in a cost effective way. The main provisions which substantially change Directive 2009/28/EC or add new elements are as follows: the proposal sets out the Union binding overall target for 2030: Member States shall collectively ensure that the share of energy from renewable sources in the Union's gross final consumption of energy in 2030 is at least 27%. It establishes the 2020 national targets as baseline; it lays down the general principles that Member States may apply when designing cost-effective support schemes; the provision which regulates how to calculate the share of energy from renewable sources now includes a decreasing maximum share of biofuels and bioliquids produced from food or feed crops starting from 2021; the proposal includes a new calculation methodology (anchored on the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive) of minimum levels of energy from renewable sources in new and existing buildings that are subject to renovation; it establishes a permit granting process for renewable energy projects with one designated authority (""one-stop-shop""); it includes some modifications to the guarantees of origin system; it empowers consumers by enabling them to self-consume without undue restrictions; Member States will endeavour to achieve an annual increase of 1% in the share of renewable energy in the heating and cooling supply; the proposal establishes a EU-level obligation for fuel suppliers to provide a certain share (6.8% in 2030) of low-emission and renewable fuels, in order to stimulate decarbonisation; the draft regulation strengthens the existing EU sustainability criteria for bioenergy, by extending their scope to cover biomass and biogas for heating and cooling and electricity generation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2012/27/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council is an element to progress towards the Energy Union, under which energy efficiency should be treated as an energy source in its own right. The 'energy efficiency first' principle should be taken into account when setting new rules for the supply side and other policy areas. The European Council of October 2014 set a 27 % energy efficiency target for 2030, to be reviewed by 2020 'having in mind a Union level of 30%. In December 2015, the European Parliament called upon the Commission to also assess the viability of a 40 % energy efficiency target for the same timeframe. The Commission proposed to review and consequently amend the Directive to adapt it to the 2030 perspective. Energy efficiency is one of the most cost effective ways to support the transition to a low carbon economy and to create growth, employment and investment opportunities. Moderation of energy demand is one of the five dimensions of the Energy Union Strategy adopted on 25 February 2015. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the assessment showed that a level higher than 27 % energy efficiency in 2030 would bring higher benefits with regard to jobs and economic growth, security of supply, greenhouse gas emission reductions, health and environment. Based on this multidimensional analysis a political decision of a binding 30 % energy efficiency target was taken. Underpinned by dedicated policies at the EU, national and regional level, this target will bring substantial multiple benefits for Europe. Such a target represents a drop in final energy consumption of 17% compared to 2005. It will increase economic growth, leading to an increase in GDP of around 0.4% (EUR 70 billion). In terms of social impacts, the preferred option would have a positive effect on employment: a review of more than 20 studies concluded that for every EUR 1.2 million spent on energy efficiency approximately 23 jobs are directly supported in the energy efficiency industry. CONTENT: the proposal for an amending Directive presented by the Commission aims to improve the current Directive (Directive 2012/27/EU) on energy efficiency. set a 30% binding energy efficiency target for 2030 at EU level which will give Member States and investors a long term perspective to plan their policies and investments and to adapt their strategies towards energy efficiency; extend beyond 2020 the energy saving obligation while retaining the rate of 1.5% of annual energy sales and the possibility to use both energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative measures while making it clear that Member States can achieve the required energy savings through an energy efficiency obligation scheme, alternative measures, or a combination of both approaches; improve the provision of consumer information on their heating and cooling consumption and their rights in metering and billing of thermal energy strengthened, in particular for people living in multi-apartment buildings. In order to improve frequency of information, an obligation for heat meters to be remotely readable is introduced; strengthen social aspects of energy efficiency by requiring that energy poverty must be taken into account in designing energy efficiency obligation schemes and alternative measures; amending the article on delegated powers in order to delete the current time limit on the delegation, replacing it with the standard five year period; add a general review clause to the Directive, under which the Commission must evaluate the Directive and submit a report to the European Parliament and Council by 28 February 2024, and then every five years. amend the default primary energy factor (PEF) in Annex IV to take into account technological advances."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND : in its Energy Union strategy of 25 February 2015, the Commission stressed the need for an integrated governance to make sure that energy-related actions at Union, regional, national and local level all contribute to the Energy Union's objectives, thereby broadening the scope of Governance – beyond the 2030 Framework for Climate and Energy – to all five key dimensions of the Energy Union. These are (i) energy security; (ii) internal energy market; (iii) moderation of demand; (iv) decarbonisation; and (v) research, innovation and competitiveness. In its resolution of 15 December 2015, the European Parliament called for the Energy Union governance to be ambitious, reliable, transparent, and democratic and fully inclusive of the European Parliament and to ensure that the 2030 climate and energy targets are achieved. Current planning and reporting requirements (for both the Commission and Member States) in the energy and climate fields provide benefits, but they are found in a wide range of separate pieces of legislation adopted at different points in time. Moreover, some of the current requirements have been defined with a view to achieving the corresponding 2020 targets, and are not suited to supporting the achievement of the 2030 Framework for Energy and Climate, nor are they synchronised with the planning and reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement, which was adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2015 (COP 21). The proposal has been prepared in parallel to the reviews in the energy policy sector, particularly regarding renewable energy, energy efficiency and market design. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that a new, single legal act fully incorporating the Monitoring Mechanism Regulation (MMR) is the preferred option. The regulatory fitness check (REFIT) supporting the proposed Regulation suggests that a significant reduction of administrative burden on Member States as well as on the Commission could be expected from the new approach, but it can only partially quantify such impacts due to the limited availability of reliable data. CONTENT: the draft regulation aims at ensuring a coordinated and coherent implementation of the Energy Union Strategy across its five dimensions, as well as the collective achievement of the Energy Union objectives through a combination of EU and national measures on the basis of streamlined planning, reporting and monitoring obligations and a functional governance process between the Commission and Member States. Specifically, the proposal brings together the existing scattered planning and reporting obligations from the main pieces of EU legislation across energy, climate and other Energy Union related policy areas and thereby achieve a major simplification of obligations, by reducing, aligning and updating such requirements, and removing duplications. In all, the proposal integrates, streamlines or repeals more than 50 existing individual planning, reporting and monitoring obligations of the energy and climate acquis. More precisely, the proposal: sets out the obligation for Member States to produce a national integrated energy and climate plan for the period 2021 to 2030 by 1 January 2019, as well as for subsequent ten-year periods; establishes a consultation process between the Commission and Member States before the finalisation of the plan, based on the draft national plan to be provided to the Commission by 1 January 2018, and every ten years thereafter for the following ten year periods. In this framework, the Commission will be able to make recommendations regarding the level of ambition of objectives, targets and contributions as well as on specific policies and measures included in the plan. Other Member States will also be able to comment on the draft plan in the framework of regional consultations. The plans need to be updated by 1 January 2024 (still with a 2030 perspective); sets out the obligation for Member States to prepare and report to the Commission long-term low emission strategies with a 50 years perspective, which are key to contribute towards broader sustainable development goals, as well as moving towards the long-term goal set by the Paris Agreement; sets out the obligation for Member States to produce biennial progress reports on the implementation of the plans from 2021 onwards across the five dimensions of the Energy Union to track progress; sets out the obligation of the Commission to monitor and assess Member States’ progress in relation to the objectives set in the national plan; sets out the requirements for national and Union inventory systems for GHG emissions, policies, measures and projections; sets out the mechanisms and principles for cooperation and support between Member States and the Union. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: officials, temporary agents or external personnel working in the Energy and Climate action policy areas will be allocated for the performance of the tasks in the Commission, within the existing overall human resources. Regarding the European Environment Agency, a phasing in of additional contract agents (up to 3 in 2020) is requested on top of the existing human resources programming for the EEA. The costs resulting from the implementation of the proposed regulation (estimated at EUR 9.908 million, including administrative expenses) will be fully accommodated under the current programmed financial envelope of the budget items in question until 2020. As far as the financial resources needed for the European Environment Agency (EUR 1.635 million) are concerned, those will be additional to the current financial programming. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise unable to access printed material must have equal access to books and printed material in order to fully and effectively participate in society. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired: 39 million are blind and 246 million have low vision. The World Blind Union reports that in Europe only 5% of published books are available in an accessible format for visually impaired persons, while in developing countries – where approximately 90% of visually impaired people live – this rate is as low as 1%. Since January 2011, the European Union has been bound by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. This enshrines the right of access to information (Article 21) and the right of people with disabilities to participate in cultural life on an equal basis with others (Article 30). The Convention has become an integral part of the EU legal order. Twenty-five Member States are parties to the Convention and three countries are finalising ratification. In 2009, negotiations began in the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) on a possible international treaty introducing limitations and exceptions to copyright for the benefit of people who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled, with the objective of facilitating the cross-border exchange of books in accessible formats. On 26 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission to participate in these negotiations, on behalf of the European Union. The WIPO negotiations were successfully concluded at the diplomatic conference held in Marrakesh between 17 and 28 June 2013. These led to the adoption of the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or otherwise Print Disabled on 27 June 2013. The Council authorised the signature of the Treaty on behalf of the European Union on 14 April 2014. It is now necessary to conclude this Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: this proposal calls on the Council to approve, on behalf of the European Union, the Marrakesh Treaty to Facilitate Access to Published Works for Persons who are Blind, Visually Impaired, or Otherwise Print Disabled. Objectives of the Treaty: the Treaty establishes a set of international rules which ensure that there are limitations or exceptions to copyright at national level for the benefit of people who are blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled and enable the cross-border exchange of accessible format copies of published works that have been made under an exception or limitation to copyright in any of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty. Main provisions: Definition and scope: the Treaty defines: - the beneficiaries: they are people who are blind, have a visual impairment or a perceptual or reading disability, or are otherwise unable, due to physical disability, to hold or manipulate a book, or focus or move their eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading; - works: as literary and artistic works within the meaning of Article 2(1) of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, in the form of text, notation and/or related illustrations, whether published or otherwise made publicly available in any media. By virtue of an agreed statement, this also covers audiobooks; - an accessible-format copy: as is a copy in an alternative manner and form compared to the format in which the work has been published and which gives beneficiaries access to the work as comfortably as sighted people could access it. The accessible-format copy must be used exclusively by beneficiaries and it must respect the integrity of the original work. Accessible format copies made under a limitation or exception to copyright may be exported by ‘authorised entities’, defined as government institutions or other organisations that provide education, instructional training, adaptive reading or information access to blind, visually impaired, or otherwise print-disabled persons on a non-profit basis. These entities must ensure that they only distribute accessible formats to beneficiaries, that they discourage the reproduction, distribution and making available of unauthorised copies and that they maintain due care in, and records of, their handling of the copies. Production obligations of accessible format copies: the Treaty obliges every Contracting Party to provide, in their national copyright laws, for a limitation or exception to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public, to facilitate the availability of works in accessible formats for the Treaty’s beneficiaries. Contracting Parties may decide to limit such limitations or exceptions to cases where accessible format copies are not commercially available on reasonable terms to beneficiaries in their territory. ‘Three-step test’: Contracting Parties may only allow accessible format copies to be exported, if they ensure that relevant limitations or exceptions to the rights of reproduction, distribution and making available to the public are subject to the ‘three-step test’. This means that either they must be a party to the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT) or they must otherwise ensure that the relevant limitations or exceptions are limited to certain special cases which do not conflict with the normal exploitation of the work and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder. Import authorisation: the Treaty clarifies that, to the extent a Contracting Party permits a beneficiary or an authorised entity to make an accessible-format copy of a work, it should also permit accessible-format copies to be imported. Contracting Parties are obliged to take appropriate measures, if necessary, to ensure that when they provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures, this legal protection does not prevent the beneficiaries from enjoying the limitations and exceptions provided for in the Treaty. Protection of privacy: the Treaty also requires Contracting Parties to protect the privacy of beneficiaries and to cooperate in order to facilitate the cross-border exchange of accessible-format copies. WIPO will set up an information access point to assist authorised entities in identifying one another with a view to working together. The Treaty also encourages authorised entities to provide information on their policies and practices to interested parties and to members of the public. Ratification procedure and entry into force: the Treaty confirms that Contracting Parties are free to determine the appropriate method of implementing the Treaty within their own legal system and practice. However, they must comply with existing international obligations under the Berne Convention, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights and the WIPO Copyright Treaty (WCT). The Treaty will enter into force once twenty Contracting Parties have ratified it. Other specific provisions: the Treaty also: Competence of the EU: the EU may become a party to the Treaty, having made the declaration during the Marrakesh diplomatic conference, that it is competent in respect of, and has its own legislation binding on all its Member States on matters covered by this Treaty and that it has been duly authorised, in accordance with its internal procedures, to become party to the Treaty. The European Union signed the final act of the diplomatic conference on 28 June 2013 and signed the Treaty on 30 April 2014 in Geneva."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Brazil entered into force on 7 August 2007. The Agreement provides that it ‘shall initially be valid for a period of five years and may be renewed by agreement between the Parties after evaluation during the penultimate year of each subsequent renewal period’. The Agreement was last renewed in 2012 and remains in force until 7 August 2017, unless the Parties renew it for the next five-year period. Since the Agreement was last renewed, Brazil has made significant advances in its science, technology and innovation (STI) policy, which has contributed to the institutional strengthening of the STI system. Brazil remains at the forefront of research in the field of agriculture, as well as in tropical and infectious diseases. It is also a world-class player in the fields of information and communication technologies, nanotechnologies and energy and it hosts some of Latin America’s top universities. These research areas are of interest to the European Union. The links between Brazil and the EU in science, technology and innovation have been growing through intense cooperation at EU and Member State level. Cooperation between the EU and the Brazilian research community led, among other results, to the development of a new drug for Chagas disease (already registered with the Food and Drug Administration to start clinical testing) and to the development of a new biomass pre-treatment process for advanced bioethanol (allowing the set-up of the first commercial advanced bioethanol plant in Europe). It is, therefore, in the EU’s interest to renew the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and Brazil for a new period of five years. This is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: with this proposal for a decision, it is planned to call on the Council to renew the Agreement on cooperation in the field of science and technology between the European Community and Brazil for a further period of 5 years. The content of the renewed Agreement is identical to that of the current Agreement. Cooperation would be maintained for the period from 8 August 2017 to 7 August 2022. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the implementation of the Agreement entails a financial envelope of EUR 345 000 from 2017 to 2022 for expenditure on human and administrative resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the objective of providing EU citizens with an area of ​​freedom, security and justice without internal borders presupposes exchanging information extracted from criminal records between the competent authorities of the Member States. These exchanges of information are organised and facilitated by the rules laid down in Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA on the organisation and content of the exchange of information extracted from the criminal record between Member States, a new criminal procedure and the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) established by Council Decision 2009/316/JHA. Although it is possible to exchange information on convictions concerning third-country nationals (TCNs) through ECRIS, there is no procedure or mechanism to do so in an efficient manner. Information on third country nationals is not gathered within the Union in the Member State of nationality as it is for nationals of Member States, but only stored in the Member States where the convictions have been handed down. A complete overview of the criminal history of a third country national can therefore be ascertained only if such information is requested from all Member States. Such 'blanket requests' impose an administrative burden on all Member States, including those not holding information on that third country national. In practice, this burden deters Member States from requesting information on third country nationals, and leads to Member States limiting the criminal record information to information stored in their national register. To improve the situation, it is proposed to establish a system by which the central authority of a Member State can find out quickly and efficiently in which other Member State(s) criminal record information on a third country national is stored. As a result of the terrorist attacks in many European cities, exchange of information on criminal records is crucial to combat cross-border crime. The initiative follows the requests of the European Council and the Justice and Home Affairs Council to improve the existing ECRIS. It also reflects the Commission's new approach to the management of data for borders and security. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the creation of a centralised ECRIS-TCN system containing both alphanumeric data and fingerprints is the preferred solution. It would be the most cost efficient, and technically less complex and easier to maintain compared to the others. This option also offers the additional advantages of making the ECRIS-TCN system suitable for participating in a future shared biometric matching service and a common identity repository, facilitating direct access for Eurojust, Europol, [and the European Public Prosecutor's Office] and creating a central contact point at Eurojust for third States requiring information on convicted TCN. If Member States were to systematically send ‘blanket’ requests, the administrative burden in responding to them has been identified as the most costly element (estimated up to EUR 78 million) of the ECRIS-workflow; the proposed solution saves such costs. CONTENT: this proposal supplements the Commission's 2016 proposal for a Directive to amend the ECRIS Framework Decision and to repeal the ECRIS Council Decision: creating a centralised system to efficiently identify which Member State(s) hold conviction information on TCN; establishing rules under which the ECRIS-TCN system is used by competent authorities to obtain information on such previous convictions through the European Criminal Records Information System. The proposed hit/no hit search system, based on alphanumeric data and fingerprints of TCN convicted in the Member States, will allow Member States to quickly identify other Member State(s) having convicted a particular TCN. The requesting Member State should then request those identified Member States to provide the actual conviction information through the existing ECRIS system as improved by January 2016 proposal. As soon as this becomes technically possible, facial images may also be used to identify a third country national on the basis of this biometric identifier The proposal sets an obligation for the convicting Member State: to create a data record in the Central ECRIS-TCN System for each convicted TCN as soon as possible after the conviction was entered into the national criminal records register; to create records in the ECRIS-TCN system of 'historical' convictions of third country nationals, i.e. convictions handed down prior to the entry into force of the Regulation. Member States would be required to use the ECRIS-TCN system in all cases where they receive a request for information on previous convictions of third country nationals in accordance with national law, and to follow up on any hits with the Member States identified through the ECRIS system. They would also be required to verify the accuracy of the data sent to the Central System and to correct them, as well as to amend the data sent to the Central System in case of any subsequent amendment in national criminal records. The proposal entrusts eu-LISA with the task of developing and operationally managing the ECRIS-TCN system. It nominates Eurojust as the contact point for third countries and international organisations which wish to request conviction information on a TCN. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on the EU and national budgets would be as follows: (i) one-off costs for the EU of around EUR 13 002 000; (ii) for the Member States approximately EUR 13 344 000 (a total of approximately EUR 26 346 000). Total on-going costs are expected to increase gradually over the years, starting at EUR 8 220 000 and increasing up to a maximum of EUR 17 520 000."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council harmonises national provisions concerning the distribution of insurance and reinsurance products and insurance-based investment products by insurance intermediaries, insurance companies, their employees, and ancillary insurance intermediaries in the Union. IDD entered into force on 23 February 2016 and Member States have until 23 February 2018 to transpose and apply its provisions. On 21 September 2017, the Commission adopted two Delegated Regulations supplementing IDD with regard to product oversight and governance requirements for insurance undertakings and insurance distributors and to information requirements and conduct of business rules applicable to the distribution of insurance-based investment products. In its decisions to raise no objections to the Delegated Regulations [see 2017/2854(DEA) and 2017/2855(DEA) ], the European Parliament asked the Commission to adopt a legislative proposal setting up a date of application on 1 October 2018, rather than 23 February 2018, as the date of application of the transitional measures of the IDD. The European Parliament justified this request by the fact that it was necessary to give more time to the insurance sector (which includes small operators) to better prepare for a correct and effective implementation of the IDD and to implement the technical and organisational changes required to comply with delegated regulations. Sixteen Member States supported Parliament’s proposal and further requested an extension of the transposition period until at least 1 October 2018 at least. While considering that the sector has already had a lot of time to adapt, the Commission agrees to respond to the request of the European Parliament and the Member States to postpone to 1 October 2018 the date from which Member States will be obliged to apply the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the IDD. CONTENT: the proposed amendment of Directive (EU) 2016/97 provides that by 23 February 2018 at the latest, Member States must adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with that Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council has proved successful in regulating the spirit drinks sector. However, in the light of recent experience and technological innovation it is necessary to update the rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks and to review the ways geographical indications for spirit drinks are registered. In order to align the powers conferred upon the Commission pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 to Articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, further amendments to that Regulation are needed. CONTENT: the aim of this Commission proposal is to replace Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 and bring it into line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). More specifically, the proposal: divides the provisions adopted by the Commission under that Regulation into delegated acts and implementing acts; contains minor technical adjustments of EU legislation on spirit drinks and it replaces the existing procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector, with new procedures modelled on the more exhaustive and well tested procedures for agricultural products and foodstuffs laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council. It has not been proposed to change the existing EU legal framework for spirit drinks enables the free circulation of goods in the single market by setting up product definitions, labelling rules and provisions related to the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. Therefore, the purpose and scope of the existing regulation will remain unchanged. This Regulation lays down rules on the definition, presentation and labelling of spirit drinks, as well as on the protection of geographical indications for spirit drinks. It shall also apply to the use of ethyl alcohol or distillates of agricultural origin in the production of alcoholic beverages and to the use of spirit drinks’ names in the presentation and labelling of other foodstuffs. It shall apply to the products placed on the Union market whether produced in the Union or in third countries, as well as to those produced in the Union for export. Given the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to keep the spirit drinks Regulation for specific measures on the description and presentation of spirit drinks which go beyond the general rules provided in Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers, while remaining consistent with those general rules. Lastly, some of the elements currently included in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 716/2013 that concern definitions and rules related to compound terms and allusions, are considered essential and have therefore been introduced in the proposal as part of the basic act. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the defence industry is a major element of the economy of the European Union. For Europe to take over more responsibility for its defence, the Commission considers it crucial to improve competitiveness and enhance innovation across the Union defence industry. The proposal for a European defence industrial development programme aims at enhancing the competitiveness and innovation of the Union defence industry including cyber defence. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the European Defence Action Plan, which sets out measures to achieve greater European defence cooperation and support the competitiveness of the European defence industry. It proposed in particular to launch a European Defence Fund to support investment in joint research and the joint development of defence equipment and technologies. The initiative was welcomed by the European Council and the Commission was invited to present proposals in the first half of 2017. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to establish a European Defence Industrial Development Programme for Union action covering the period from 1st January 2019 to 31 December 2020. The amount for the implementation of the Programme for the period 2019-2020 is set at EUR 500 million in current prices. The Commission will be responsible for the execution and the management structure of the programme. The Programme shall have the following objectives: to foster the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the Union defence industry by supporting actions in their development phase; to support and leverage the cooperation between undertakings in the development of technologies or products in line with defence capability priorities; to foster better exploitation of the results of defence research and contribute to closing the gaps between research and development. The programme will help create a collaborative approach between defence industrial players of the Member States and is expected to reduce wasteful duplications, dispersions and create economies of scale. Union's financial assistance : this shall take the form of grants and financial instruments or via public procurement. The programme shall support the design, definition of common technical specifications, prototyping, testing, qualification and certification of defence products, tangible or intangible components and technologies. Support can also be provided for studies, feasibility assessments and other support activities. Eligible entities : the action shall be undertaken in a cooperation of at least three undertakings which are established in at least two different Member States. Beneficiaries shall be undertakings established in the Union, in which Member States and/or nationals of Member States own more than 50% of the undertaking and effectively control it, whether directly or indirectly through one or more intermediate undertakings. The financial assistance of the Union provided under the Programme may not exceed 20% of the total cost of the action where it relates to prototyping. In all the other cases, the assistance may cover up to the total cost of the action. Award criteria : actions proposed for funding under the Programme shall be evaluated on the basis of the following cumulative criteria: excellence; contribution to the innovation and technological development of defence industries; contribution to the security and defence interests of the Union by enhancing defence technologies which contribute to implement defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the Union; viability of actions, the contribution to the competitiveness of the European defence industry through the demonstration by the beneficiaries that Member States have committed to jointly produce and procure the final product or technology in a coordinated way. The Commission shall regularly monitor the implementation of the programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal concerns the recast of Regulation (EC) No 91/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on rail transport statistics. The codification is carried out in the interests of clarity, given that the Regulation has been substantially amended several times. The new regulation will replace the various acts incorporated therein, whilst fully preserving its substance. CONTENT: the objective of this Regulation is to establish common rules for the production of rail transport statistics at Union level. Statistics on the transport of goods and passengers by rail are necessary: to enable the Commission to: (i) monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies relating to the regions and to trans-European networks; (ii) monitor Union action in the field of transport safety; in order to fulfil the monitoring tasks provided for in Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council. Scope of the Regulation : this proposed Regulation shall cover all railways in the Union. Each Member State shall report statistics which relate to rail transport on its national territory. Where a railway undertaking operates in more than one Member State, the national authorities concerned shall require the undertaking to provide data separately for each country in which it operates so as to enable national statistics to be compiled. Member States may exclude from the scope of this Regulation: railway undertakings which operate entirely or mainly within industrial and similar installations, including harbours; railway undertakings which mainly provide local tourist services, such as preserved historical steam railways. The annual statistics to be collected on the carriage of goods and passengers are set out in the Annexes to the Regulation. The proposal states that Member States should take all necessary measures to ensure the quality of the data transmitted. The quality of the statistical data shall be evaluated by Eurostat. By 31 December 2020 and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall report on the implementation of the Regulation and on future developments.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 92/66/EEC lays down the measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in poultry and certain birds. The Directive confers on the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, the power to amend the Directive’s Annexes. Thus, the Council may amend Annexes V, VI and VII to Directive 92/66/EEC which set out respectively (i) the indication of the European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle disease as well as its functions and duties, (ii) the model form to be used by Member States in order to report on the disease situation and the control measures applied; and (iii) the criteria to be applied by Member States for drawing up contingency plans specifying the national measures to be implemented in the event of an outbreak the disease. It is necessary to simplify and streamline the procedures regarding the control of Newcastle disease, in particular taking into account the new rules in relation to the designation of European Union reference laboratories provided for by Article 93 of Regulation (EU) 2017/625 of the European Parliament and of the Council, and also the new system of implementing acts provided for in Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The current European reference laboratory (EURL) for Newcastle disease is located in the United Kingdom. Hence, it needs to be replaced by an EURL located in one of the other 27 Member States in view of the United Kingdom exiting the EU. The current procedure for designating an EURL for Newcastle disease is via a Council Directive. This technical revision of the Directive 92/66/EEC will enable the use of the required implementing procedure to designate a new EURL for Newcastle disease within the tight deadlines related to BREXIT. CONTENT: the aim of this proposal is to amend Council Directive 92/66/EEC in order to ensure consistency with the TFEU and the new provisions on official controls with a view to simplifying procedures. It aims to delete Annexes V, VI and VII of that Directive and to confer on the Commission implementing powers in the matters covered by those Annexes. These powers should be exercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council (comitology Regulation). The proposal provides that the Commission shall designate, by means of implementing acts, a European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle disease. For the sake of clarity, it sets out the function and duties of the European Union reference laboratory for Newcastle Disease as well as the criteria applicable to the contingency plans to be established by Member States in the event of the onset of the disease."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Georgia continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) and the Eastern Partnership. The EU-Georgia Association Agreement, which includes the gradual introduction of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), was signed in June 2014 and entered into force on 1 July 2016. Georgia continues to face a weak external environment, which, through reduced exports and remittances, has contributed to the relatively subdued GDP growth of 2.7% in 2016 (compared to 2.9% in 2015 and 4.6% in 2014). Georgia’s fiscal deficit remains significant and its public debt-to-GDP ratio has increased. Georgia’s balance of payments position remains vulnerable due to a very large current account deficit and high external debt. In this context, the Georgian authorities and the IMF agreed, in April 2017, on a three-year (2017-2020) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement in the amount of USD 285.3 million. The aim of the EFF arrangement is to support an economic reform programme which will help Georgia reduce economic vulnerabilities, and promote higher and more inclusive economic growth. In view of Georgia’s residual external financing needs, the Georgian authorities requested complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in June 2017. The proposed new MFA operation is the third one after Georgia’s military conflict with Russia in August 2008. The first of those operations (EUR 46 million, fully in the form of grants) was implemented in 2009-2010 and the second (again EUR 46 million, half in grants and half loans) in 2015-2017. The EU’s macro-financial assistance is an exceptional emergency instrument aimed at addressing severe balance-of-payment difficulties in third countries. Given that there is still a significant residual external financing gap in Georgia’s balance of payments over and above the resources provided by IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Georgia is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Georgia’s request for support to the economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. CONTENT: the proposed new MFA operation under consideration would amount to a maximum of EUR 45 million. It will help Georgia cover part of the external financing needs for the period of 2017-2020, which are estimated at USD 752 million. The operation will reduce the economy’s short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities. It will be designed and implemented in coordination with the adjustment and reform programmes Georgia has agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as with the reforms agreed in the context of the EU’s budget support operations and the DCFTA. The Commission proposes to provide the amount of the assistance in the form of medium-term loans of up to EUR 35 million and grants of up to EUR 10 million. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in two instalments. Disbursements would be conditional on successful reviews under the IMF programme and on the effective drawing by Georgia on IMF funds. The Commission and the Georgian authorities would agree on a specific set of structural reform measures, to be defined in a Memorandum of Understanding. These reform measures would support the authorities’ reform agenda and complement the programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank. A pre-condition for granting the Union’s macro-financial assistance shall be that Georgia respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union’s macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems in Georgia. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service The Commission should also regularly inform the Council and the Parliament about developments relating to the assistance and provide them with relevant documents. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: assistance shall be provided in the form of a loan and grants. The loan part will be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. Assuming that the two loan disbursements (of EUR 15 million for the first tranche and EUR 20 million for the second tranche) will be made in 2018, the provisioning will take place in the 2020 budget, in accordance with the rules governing the Guarantee Fund mechanism, for an amount of EUR 3.15 million. The grant element of the assistance (EUR 10 million in total, i.e. EUR 5 million for each of the two tranches) will be financed from commitment appropriations of the 2018 budget, under the budget line 01 03 02 (Macro-financial assistance), with payments also taking place in 2018."

Following the notification by the United Kingdom of its intention to leave the Union, the 27 remaining Member States, in the margins of the General Affairs Council (Article 50), selected Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as the new seat for the European Medicines Agency. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 in order to confirm the new seat of the European Medicines Agency in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The Agency should occupy its new seat from the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom or from 30 March 2019, whichever is the earlier. It is proposed that the Regulation shall enter into force as a matter of urgency in order to give the Agency sufficient time to relocate. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the relocation of the Agency will have budgetary implications, in particular in view of the costs related to the early termination of its current rental contract in London as a consequence of the withdrawal, the costs related to the move itself and the costs related to the installation in the new premises in Amsterdam. As set out in the negotiation directives of the Council of 22 May 2017, the United Kingdom should fully cover the specific costs related to the withdrawal process, such as the relocation of the agencies based in the United Kingdom. Some of the relocation costs (e.g. costs related to the move itself) may have to be pre-financed by the EU budget prior to the final financial settlement. If necessary, the Commission will submit the relevant proposals to the European Parliament and the Council in the framework of the annual budgetary procedure for 2019 and, if necessary, for 2018. In addition, the costs related to the installation in the new premises will also be presented in the context of the building procedure set out in Article 203 of the Financial Regulation, which requires prior approval from the European Parliament and the Council before contracts related to building projects are concluded. This procedure is expected to be launched as soon as possible (at the latest in early 2018)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Decision (EU) 2017/1324 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for the participation of the Union in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The strategic objective of PRIMA is to build research and innovation capacities and to develop knowledge and common innovative solutions for agro-food systems in order to make them sustainable, as well as for an integrated water supply and management in the Mediterranean area. PRIMA will be jointly undertaken by a number of Member States and third countries with a high level of commitment to scientific, management and financial integration and under the same terms and conditions. Lebanon expressed its wish to join PRIMA as a Participating State and pledged to commit a financial contribution of EUR 7 million to the initiative. The negotiations started on 26 June 2017 and were successfully completed on 27 July 2017, when the text of the draft Agreement was initialled by representatives from each of the future Parties. In order to ensure that Lebanon participates in PRIMA on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020, an International Agreement with the Union is required to extend the scope of the legal regime established by Decision (EU) 2017/1324 to Lebanon. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council conclude the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Union and Lebanon setting out the terms and conditions for participation of Lebanon in the Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area (PRIMA). The present initiative will allow Lebanon to become a Participating State in PRIMA, and thus engaged on an equal footing with Member States and third countries associated to Horizon 2020. Lebanese legal entities would be automatically eligible to apply for EU funding in projects funded from the EU budget. In order to ensure the protection of Union financial interests, particularly the powers of the Commission, the European Anti-Fraud Office, the Court of Auditors and the PRIMA Implementation Structure (PRIMA-IS) to carry out audits and investigations, the Agreement and obliges the Parties to provide all necessary assistance to ensure their implementation and agree on detailed arrangements for assistance. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 82 800 for the period 2018-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the first Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement set out, for a period of three years, the fishing opportunities granted to Union vessels in the fishing zone under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Mauritius and the financial contribution granted by the European Union. The period of application of that Protocol expired on 27 January 2017. A new protocol must now be approved on behalf of the Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving on behalf of the Union the new Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritius. The objective of this Protocol is to enhance cooperation between the European Union and Mauritius to promote a sustainable fisheries policy, sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Mauritius waters and support Mauritius in the development of its sustainable ocean economy. Fishing opportunities: the fishing opportunities granted for highly migratory species shall be as follows: 40 tuna seiners and 45 surface longliners. Mauritius shall authorise a maximum of 20 supply vessels to assist in the operations of Union fishing vessels authorised in Mauritius waters unless the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) decides otherwise.

This total financial contribution shall comprise: Duration: the Protocol shall apply, on a provisional basis, from the date of signature. It shall apply for a period of four years from the date of its provisional application. Provision is made for possible suspensions. The Agreement establishes the Joint Committee responsible for monitoring its implementation. It may approve certain amendments to the Protocol.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the EU and Norway are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) which provides for the free movement of goods, with the exception of agricultural and fisheries products. Article 19 of the EEA Agreement provides that the contracting Parties undertake to continue their efforts to achieve progressive liberalisation of trade in agricultural products. The previous agreement in the form of an exchange of letters liberalising trade in agricultural products between Norway and the European Union was signed on 15 April 2011. It provided for mutual tariff rate quotas and reductions in duty. It also included an undertaking by the Parties to resume bilateral negotiations in two years’ time. The 2011 EU-Norway bilateral agricultural trade agreement increased the duty-free access of EU agricultural products to the Norwegian market to around 60 % of trade. Therefore, the latest round of negotiations aimed at: (i) increasing the degree of liberalisation on both sides; (ii) increasing the current tariff rate quotas; and (iii) opening new tariff rate quotas for additional agricultural products; (iv) addressing certain pending trade irritants. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council adopt a decision approving, on behalf of the European Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Norway concerning additional trade preferences in agricultural products. The Agreement provides for further trade preferences for trade in agricultural products, including additional fully liberalised tariff lines. For more sensitive products such as meat, dairy, vegetables and ornamental plants, additional or new tariff quotas have been agreed upon. The deepening of trade relations with Norway fits into the overall context of EU trade policy and is beneficial for the EU since the EU is a net exporter of basic agricultural products to Norway. The main products exported by the EU are wines and vinegar, animal feed, soya and colza oil, live plants and cheese. Imports into the EU from Norway are mainly soybean, animal and vegetable oils and their residues, fur skins and undenatured ethyl alcohol. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this Agreement will have no impact on the expenditure side of the EU budget. The new concessions granted on imports from Norway will likely result in a reduction of own resources through a lower collection of customs duties."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has approved the latter. BACKGROUND: on 10 October 2011, the Council adopted a decision authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part. Negotiations began in December 2011 and were successfully concluded with the initialling of the Agreement on 5 March 2015. Pending its entry into force, certain parts of the Agreement, as mutually determined by the EU and Australia, are provisionally applied. The Agreement will contribute significantly to the improvement of the partnership between the EU and Australia, a partnership which is based on common values and principles, including respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, international peace and security. The Agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic principles, and for international law and the principles set out in the Charter of the United Nations, which constitute the basis for cooperation between the Parties. Note on legal basis: the Agreement pursues objectives and has components in the areas of common foreign and security policy, common commercial policy and development cooperation. These aspects of the agreement are inseparably linked without one being incidental to the other. Article 218(6)(a)(iii) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides that, where an agreement establishes a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures, the Council must adopt a decision concluding the agreement after obtaining consent of the European Parliament. Moreover, the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) of the TFEU provides that the Council must act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. The common foreign and security policy is a field for which unanimity is required for the adoption of a Union act. Equally, the Agreement establishes an institutional framework by organising cooperation procedures between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part. In light of the above, the legal basis of the proposed decision should therefore be Article 37 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU), Article 207 TFEU and Article 212(1) TFEU read in conjunction with Article 218(6)(a) TFEU and the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU. CONTENT : the Commission and of the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy jointly propose that the Council adopt a decision approving the Framework Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Australia, of the other part, on behalf of the Union. The text of the Agreement is attached to the Decision. The purpose of the Agreement is ‘to establish a strengthened Partnership between the Parties; to provide a framework to facilitate and promote cooperation across a broad range of areas of mutual interest; and to enhance cooperation to develop solutions to regional and global challenges’. The content of the Agreement covers three pillars: -political cooperation on foreign policy and security issues of common interest, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), small arms and light weapons (SALW), counter-terrorism, promoting international peace and security and cooperation in multilateral fora. The Agreement includes binding political clauses based on the shared values. These clauses are in line with the standard clauses found in similar agreements signed by the EU; -cooperation on economic and trade matters, including economic policy dialogue, promoting trade and investment matters, and sectoral economic and trade issues, such as : -sectoral cooperation, including in the areas of: -Institutional framework: the Agreement establishes a Joint Committee, the objective of which is to monitor the development of the bilateral relationship between the Parties. Suspension mechanism: the Agreement includes a suspension mechanism. In cases of particularly serious and substantial violation of the essential elements of the Agreement, the Agreement may be suspended or terminated, and other appropriate measures affecting other agreements may be taken in accordance with the rights and obligations of the Parties under such agreements. Once in force, the Agreement will create a coherent, legally binding overall framework for the EU’s relations with Australia."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 23 of the Convention provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. Following the sixth ratification, of which four were by Member States of the Council of Europe, Convention No. 196 came into force on 1 June 2007. As of 21 February 2017, 23 EU Member States have ratified the Convention, and all EU Member States have signed it. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and uphold the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. Given the global nature of terrorism, a common understanding of terrorist and terrorism-related offences, complemented with provisions to facilitate cooperation between national authorities as laid down in Convention No. 196 contributes to further enhancing the effectiveness of the criminal justice instruments and cooperation at Union and international level. The Union has already adopted measures in the different areas covered by Convention No. 196 on the basis of provisions of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU. With the adoption of the Directive on combating terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. This can only be done by concluding Convention No. 196, at the latest simultaneously with conclusion of its Additional Protocol. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. It must be read together with a proposal concerning a decision to conclude the Additional Protocol (Convention No. 217) that supplements the Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (Convention No. 196). Objectives of the Convention: Convention No. 196 defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has competence under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers areas to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, including the setting of minimum rules for the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism, as well as police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The purpose of Convention No. 196 is to enhance the efforts of the parties in preventing terrorism and its negative effects on the full enjoyment of human rights, in particular the right to life, both by measures taken at national level and through international co-operation. It thus criminalises the following acts when committed intentionally: In addition, the Convention: Convention No. 196 also contains several provisions aiming at strengthening international co-operation in criminal matters through mutual legal assistance, including spontaneous exchange of information and extradition, being subject to a non-discrimination clause. An Additional Protocol (Convention No. 217) was adopted by the Council of Europe on 19 May 2015. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 and came into force on 1 July 2017. It is not possible to be a party to the Additional Protocol without also being a party to Convention No. 1963. The European Union has signed Convention No. 196, as well as its Additional Protocol. Territorial application: Convention No. 196 signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. Convention No. 196 signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 196) was signed by the Union on 22 October 2015, subject to its conclusion. Article 10 of the Protocol provides that the latter is open for the approval of the European Union. The Additional Protocol came into force on 1 July 2017. As of 11 July 2017, three EU Member States have ratified the Additional Protocol, and twenty-four EU Member States have signed it. The terrorist threat has grown and rapidly evolved in recent years. Foreign terrorist fighters have been linked to recent attacks and plots in several Member States. In addition, the Union and its Member States face increased threats from individuals who are inspired or instructed by terrorist groups abroad. In view of the continuing threat of terrorism to fundamental rights and the global nature of terrorism, the European Union must act united to promote and defend the principles of democracy and the rule of law in Europe. The Union has already adopted measures in the area covered by the Additional Protocol, including substantive criminal law provisions as well as a provision on enhanced information exchange. With the adoption of the directive on the fight against terrorism, the European Union is ready to complete its commitment to be a party to the Additional Protocol by conclusion of that instrument. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the decision to conclude the Additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism (CETS No. 217). The present proposal is therefore accompanied by, and must be read together with, a proposal concerning a decision to conclude Convention No. 196 on behalf of the Union. Objectives of the Additional Protocol: the Protocol defines criminal offences related to terrorism, an area for which the Union has jurisdiction under Article 83(1) TFEU. It covers fields to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies, namely the setting of minimum rules concerning the definition of criminal offences in the area of terrorism (Article 83(1) TFEU) where consent by the European Parliament is required. The Additional Protocol supplements Convention No. 196 with a series of provisions aimed at implementing the criminal law aspects of UN Security Council Resolution 2178(2014) on “Threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts”. It seeks to prevent and curb the flow of foreign terrorist fighters to conflict zones and provide a common understanding of and response to foreign terrorist fighter-related offences, which serves as a benchmark for information exchange and facilitates cross-border investigations and prosecutions of acts of a preparatory nature having the potential and danger of leading to the commission of terrorist offences. The Additional Protocol thus provides for the criminalisation of the following acts: Contact point: the Additional Protocol requires the parties to designate a contact point for the 24/7 exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters. It is proposed to designate Europol as this contact point, under the conditions stipulated in Regulation (EU) 2016/794 on relations with partners and the transfer and exchange of personal data. Territorial application: the Additional Protocol signed and eventually concluded by the European Union is binding upon and applies in all EU Member States with the exception of Denmark. It is binding upon and applies in the United Kingdom only insofar as this Member State notifies the Council of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this instrument. Ireland is bound by Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA and is therefore to take part in the adoption of this Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the need for statistical information on businesses for policymaking and other purposes is growing. However, the current system for producing European business statistics is fragmented into separate domain-specific regulations which leads to inconsistencies in the data collected and inefficiencies in their production. The draft Regulation on European business statistics, amending Regulation (EC) No 184/2005 and repealing 10 legal acts in the field of business statistics (FRIBS) is part of the Commission’s REFIT Programme. This programme seeks to simplify EU law and reduce unnecessary regulatory costs. It identified business statistics as one of its priority area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is the one which seeks to modernise the European business statistics in a single framework (FRIBS) using a mix of measures, including alternative options for the modernisation of Intrastat. This option shall enable European business statistics to be put into one single legal framework FRIBS which will implicitly guarantee much higher consistency of business statistics. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes a common legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics related to the structure, the economic activities and the performance of businesses, as well as on the international transactions and research and development activities of the Union economy. The proposal envisages the integration of statistical requirements and legal acts for business statistics by streamlining and simplifying them and reducing the burden on businesses. It is expected to deliver: better quality European Statistical System (ESS) business registers, common definitions to be used in all the statistical domains it covers, the exchange of identifiable micro-data and an integrated data structure. The proposed Regulation covers the following issues: data sources to be used for business statistics and statistical business registers; business statistics (subject areas and the topics) as well as the periodicity with which the topics need to be provided; business registers.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 established a multiannual plan for cod, herring and sprat stocks in the Baltic Sea. The objective of the plan is to ensure that the exploitation of the stocks concerned restores and maintains populations of these stocks above the levels that achieve maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The scientific evaluation of the Bothnian Sea herring stock and the Bothnian Bay herring stock conducted in 2017 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) showed that those two stocks are similar. As a consequence, ICES combined the two stocks into one, changed the boundaries of its geographic distribution area and re-estimated the MSY fishing mortality ranges, as well as the relevant conservation reference points. Regulation (EU) No 2016/1139 provides that where, on the basis of scientific advice, the Commission considers that the conservation reference points set out in Annex II to that Regulation no longer correctly express the objectives of the plan, those points, as a matter of urgency, may be submitted for the revision to the European Parliament and the Council. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to urgently amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 to ensure that the fishing opportunities for Gulf of Bothnia herring stocks are determined in accordance with the updated conservation reference points following the scientific evaluation carried out by ICES."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Conclusions of the Presidency of the Edinburgh European Council (December 1992) confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 1365/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on statistics of goods transport by inland waterways and repealing Council Directive 80/1119/EEC. The proposed new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The main elements of the proposed codified text are as follows: Subject matter : the proposal establishes common rules for the production of European statistics concerning inland waterways transport. It shall enable the Commission to have statistics concerning the transport of goods by inland waterways in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies on the regions and on trans-European networks. Scope : Member States in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds 1 000 000 tonnes shall supply the data in accordance with the tables in Annexes I to IV to the Regulation. The effect of this Regulation is limited to those Member States where inland waterway transport exists. Pilot studies : the Commission shall ensure that pilot studies are carried out on the availability of statistical data on passenger transport by inland waterways, including cross-border transport services. The Union shall contribute to the cost of implementing these pilot studies. Implementation : the Commission may adopt: implementing acts on data transmission procedures and developing and publishing criteria and methodological requirements to ensure the quality of the data produced; delegated acts to amend the Regulation on increasing the threshold of 1 million tonnes of statistical coverage of inland waterway transport, to adapt the definitions and to adapt the Annexes in order to take account of economic and technical changes affecting definitions adopted at international level."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides following the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: in the framework of the common fisheries policy established by Regulation (EU) 1380/2013, multi-annual plans should contribute to achieving fishing at sustainable levels (Maximum Sustainable Yield). The fisheries of the North Sea and adjacent areas are highly complex, involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, as well as Norway, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. The proposal presented by the Commission establishes a plan taking into account such mixed fisheries interactions. The Basic Regulation aims at solving the problems of overfishing and discarding fish. However, without additional legislation, the Basic Regulation could lead to under-utilisation of quota in the North Sea mixed fisheries and would not allow any exemptions from the landing obligation to be adopted after the three year discard plans have expired. Hence, if no appropriate measures are taken, the Basic Regulation might have negative economic and social consequences for the fishing industry in the coming years. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred choice (a single mixed fishery multi-annual plan for North Sea demersal fisheries), wherein FMSY (maximum rate of fishing mortality) is achieved by 2020 at the latest and stocks are rebuilt to within precautionary levels quickly is judged to be more effective than Option 1 (to manage using the Basic Regulation) to achieve the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish a multi-annual plan for demersal stocks in the North Sea and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in order to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP set out in Regulation 1380/2013. The plan will: ensure the sustainable exploitation of these stocks, by ensuring that they are exploited according to the principles of maximum sustainable yield and of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management; provide stability of fishing opportunities, while ensuring that management is based on the most up to date scientific information on stocks, mixed fisheries and other aspects of the ecosystem and environment; facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation. The proposal aims to replace the current plan for cod, as well as the plan for plaice and sole by bringing all multi-annual plans for the different demersal stocks into one regulation. The plan will apply to all Union fishing vessels irrespective to their overall length in fishing in the North Sea as this is in conformity with the rules of the CFP and is in line with the effect of the vessels on the fish stocks concerned. The proposed plan: requires the EU to set catch limits that restore and maintain fish stocks above levels that can produce the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY); defines ranges within which catch limits can be set. Fishing opportunities in the higher part of the ranges will only be possible under clearly defined conditions and in line with the MSY approach; establishes safeguard measures for biomass based on the precautionary approach laid out in the Basic Regulation; obliges the EU to take swift action when the sustainability of any demersal North Sea fish stock is threatened; establishes the necessary framework for implementing regionalisation within the North Sea and provides for regional cooperation among Member States regarding the adoption of measures on the landing obligation and specific conservation measures for certain stocks; adopt thresholds above which catches of demersal stocks should only be landed in designated ports; does not include annual limits on fishing effort (the numbers of days at sea). There will be periodic evaluation (every five years) of the impact of the plan on the stock concerned based on scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) governed by Decision No 1313/2013/EU of the European Parliament and the Council strengthens cooperation between the Union and the Member States and facilitates coordination in the field of civil protection in order to improve the Union's response to natural and man-made disasters. Several recent disasters have hit several Member States simultaneously: the refugee and migration crisis and its humanitarian impact, terrorist attacks, the lack of available assets during the 2016 and 2017 forest fire seasons that resulted in over 100 deaths as well as the severe impact of a series of hurricanes in the Caribbean and fierce storms and flooding in the EU, have constituted a real stress test for the UCPM. Recent experience has shown that reliance on voluntary offers of mutual assistance, coordinated and facilitated by the Union Mechanism, does not always ensure that sufficient capacities are made available to address the basic needs of people affected by disasters in a satisfactory manner, nor that the environment and property are properly safeguarded. Following the interim evaluation of the UCPM, the examination of the UCPM by the European Court of Auditors and the report on the gaps in critical reaction capacity published in early 2017, the Commission considered it necessary to strengthen European civil protection in the light of disaster trends, including extreme weather, and against the background of internal security concerns. The proposed changes are part of the broader objective of working towards a ‘Europe that protects’. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Decision No 1313/2013/EU has the following objectives: (i) to improve disaster prevention and preparedness capabilities; (ii) to improve collective response capacity at European level; and (iii) to ensure the flexibility and efficiency of the administrative procedures of the Union Mechanism when it is involved in emergency operations. Reinforcement of European reaction assets : the proposal provides for the creation at Union level of a dedicated reserve of reaction assets (called ‘rescEU’) to be deployed by decision of the Commission, which will have the command and control. rescEU will be equipped with selected emergency capacities to respond to wildfires, floods, earthquakes and health emergencies as appropriate. rescEU shall be established to provide relief where existing capacities do not allow responding effectively to disasters. It shall consist of the following capacities: aerial forest firefighting; high capacity pumping; urban search and rescue; field hospital and emergency medical teams. All costs of these capacities would be fully covered by EU financing . At the same time, the Commission proposes to strengthen the European emergency response capacity where Member States can pre-commit national response capacities. This shall be known as the ‘European Civil Protection Reserve’. Under the new proposal, assets committed to the European Civil Protection Pool will benefit from a 75% coverage of all costs incurred during UCPM operations within the Union, including adaptation, repair, transportation and operational costs. The proposal also strengthens the incentives to pool capacities. Increased capacity for prevention and preparedness : the proposal strengthens the links between prevention, preparedness and response by connecting risk assessment to risk management planning and requiring Member States to provide their risk management plans to the Commission at the latest by 31 January 2019. Prevention plans need to include short-term actions and longer-term prevention efforts to adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change. Consistency with other EU instruments in the area of disaster risk reduction and prevention should also be strengthened by linking the EU Mechanism with cohesion and rural development policies as well as health and research. The proposal also includes provisions to ensure that the disbursement of EU funds through the Union mechanism is accompanied by adequate visibility. It also paves the way for the establishment of a dedicated structure, the Union Civil Protection Knowledge Network, which will reinforce the training component of the UCPM, in close cooperation with existing relevant national structures on the matter. More efficient administrative procedures : the proposal seeks to streamline administrative procedures in order to reduce delays in the deployment of aid. It simplifies the current system by introducing a single category of response means, the use of which requires co-financing by the Member States and the EU budget, namely the European Civil Protection Reserve. In addition, specific provisions limiting the activation of the Union mechanism to a 90-day period (unless otherwise justified) have been included in order to clarify the scope and to encourage the use of the means in the immediate reaction. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the financial envelope for the implementation of the Union Mechanism for the period covered by the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 is EUR 368.4 million. This proposal seeks a total overall increase in the UCPM financial envelope for the period 2018-2020 of EUR 280 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (EMIR Regulation) implements in the EU the G20 commitment made in 2009 to increase the stability of the OTC derivatives market. The main objective of EMIR is to reduce systemic risk by increasing the transparency of the OTC derivatives market, through core requirements. They include: (i) central clearing; (ii) margin requirements; (iii) operational risk mitigation requirements; (iv) reporting obligations for derivative contracts; (v) requirements for central counterparties (CCPs); and (vi) requirements for trade repositories. In November 2016, the Commission adopted the EMIR report, which pointed to the need to eliminate disproportionate costs and burdens on small companies and to simplify rules without compromising financial stability. Accordingly, the proposal sets out a series of targeted amendments to the EMIR Regulation, in order to simplify the rules and ensure that the latter are more proportionate. At the same time the proposal maintains all key elements of the framework that have proved to allow achieving the objectives of EMIR. It is related to and consistent with the ongoing initiative to establish a Capital Markets Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment analysis the costs and benefits of areas of EMIR where targeted action could ensure fulfilment of the EMIR objectives in a more proportionate, efficient and effective manner. The analysis shows that it would be possible to obtain a reduction of costs and restrictions, and at the same time, simplify the Regulation. It is estimated that the combined effect of all preferred options, calculated solely for the purpose of the impact assessment, amount to cost reductions ranging from EUR 2.3 billion to EUR 6.9 billion in fixed (one-off) costs and from EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 2.66 billion in operational costs. Overall, businesses, SMEs, and micro-enterprises will, in particular, benefit from (i) reducing regulatory requirements in cases where disproportionate compliance costs appear to outweigh prudential benefits and (ii) improving access to clearing. There should be no significant relevant social and economic cost. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in order to simplify the rules applicable to over the counter derivatives and make them more proportionate in order to reduce costs and regulatory burden weighing on market participants, without putting at risk financial stability. The proposal simplifies reporting requirements for all counterparties. It re-focuses the scope of the clearing obligation for financial counterparties to include some additional relevant market players while exempting the smallest financial counterparties. Specifically the proposal: removes the requirement to report historic transactions, i.e. transactions that were not outstanding on the starting date of the reporting obligation on 12 February 2014; introduces improvements to ensure the quality of reported data for trade repositories; establishes single-sided reporting by the central counterparties for exchange-traded derivatives transactions ('ETDs'); provides that, for transactions other than ETD transactions, the responsibility for reporting transactions between a small non-financial counterparty (i.e. not subject to the clearing obligation) and a financial counterparty should be on the financial counterparty to the trade; exempts intragroup transactions involving any non-financial counterparties from the reporting obligation; provides, with regards to non-financial counterparties, that only non-hedging contracts are counted towards the thresholds triggering the clearing obligation; introduces a new three–year temporary exemption for pension funds from central clearing; increases the upper limit of basic amount of fines for infringements of EMIR requirements by trade repositories; clarifies the interaction between EMIR default management tools and national insolvency laws to ensure the insolvency remoteness of client assets; requires observance of the principle to provide clearing services under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory commercial terms ('FRAND' principle). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in January 2017, Croatia notified the Commission on recent changes of its domestic insolvency law introducing new types of insolvency proceedings, such as a pre-insolvency proceeding and a consumer's insolvency proceeding. At the same time, Croatia requested that the list setting out exhaustively the insolvency proceedings in Annex A of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 be amended accordingly. The Commission carefully analysed this request in order to ensure compliance of the notification with the requirements of the Regulation. Changes to Annex A of the Regulation do not affect the substantive set of rules and may only be made by the Union legislature and not by the Member States.

It seeks to replace the list in Annex A to Regulation (EU) 2015/848 on Croatia with a new list taking account of the information notified by that Member State.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014. Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also entered into force on 21 May 2014 and became applicable as of 1 January 2014. Under Regulation (EU) No 515/2014, the provisions of the Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the Internal Security Fund ('the ISF –Borders and Visa'). This Fund aims to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation. This is the purpose of this Agreement with Iceland. CONTENT: with this proposed Council decision, the Council is called upon to approve, on behalf of the EU, the Agreement between the European Union and Iceland on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The aim of the draft Agreement with Iceland is to establish the arrangements for the participation of Iceland in the ISF – Borders and Visa and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. Protection of the EU’s financial interests: as regards budgetary and financial controls, the Member States are subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the Court of Auditors and of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)), derived either directly from the Treaty or from secondary Union legislation. These obligations must be extended to the associated country by means of the draft Agreement. In order to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities, Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 provides that cooperation agreements with third countries will expressly empower the Commission, the Court of Auditors and OLAF to conduct such audits, on-the-spot controls and inspections. Territorial provisions: Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Decision and is not bound by it or subject to its application. It will decide, within six months after the Council has adopted the proposal, whether it will implement the proposed Decision into its national law. The United Kingdom and Ireland are not participating in the adoption of this Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing, as part of the Internal Security Fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa (ISF – Borders and Visa) for the period 2014-2020, as well as Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down general provisions on the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management which became applicable as of 1 January 2014. The purpose of the ISF – Borders and Visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same European rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. It is thus a development of the Schengen acquis. Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis participate in the instrument and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the Union's financial interests and the power of audit of the Court of Auditors. The aim of the draft Agreement with Switzerland (associated country) is to establish the arrangements referred to in Article 5(7) of Regulation (EU) No 515/2014 and to enable the Commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the Union budget in respect of this instrument. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approves the Agreement with Switzerland on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the Internal Security Fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. The negotiations were held jointly with all associated countries. Two rounds of negotiations took place. The final text of the draft Agreement with Switzerland was initialled on 21 April 2017. The draft Agreement provides for the amount of Switzerland's annual financial contribution to the budget of the ISF - Borders and Visa, calculated in accordance with its GDP as a percentage of the GDP of all States participating in the ISF. It specifies the annual payments. In addition, it foresees the modalities for the designation of the Responsible Authority and for the annual reporting system. The Agreement also contains provisions aiming to protect the Union's financial interests against fraud and other irregularities as well as to ensure compliance with the provisions relevant for the financial management and control which are laid down in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union ('TFEU') and in Union law based on the TFEU. This proposal constitutes a development of elements of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom and Ireland do not take part. Denmark will decide within six months after the Council has adopted this proposal whether it will implement the proposed decision in its national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Ukraine continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the Union and Ukraine, including a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA), entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has embarked on an ambitious reform programme aiming to stabilise its economy and improve the livelihoods of its citizens. In addition to its political support, the Union pledged over EUR 11 billion financial package in March 2014 to support economic stabilisation and reform implementation in Ukraine, including 1.6 billion of macro-financial assistance pursuant to Council Decision 2002/639/EC, Decision No 646/2010/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council and pursuant to Council Decision 2014/215/EU. In view of Ukraine's substantial external financing needs, an additional EUR 1.8 billion of macro-financial assistance (MFA) was made available to the country in April 2015 pursuant to Decision (EU) 2015/601 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Since May 2014, Ukraine has received EUR 2.81 billion of macro-financial assistance from the Union , including EUR 1.2 billion out of the EUR 1.8 billion available under Decision (EU) 2015/601. Ukraine fulfilled 17 of the 21 policy commitments attached to the third tranche of EUR 600 million that could have been made available to Ukraine under the third MFA operation. Although four measures were not implemented by the time the availability period of the assistance expired in January 2018. Under these circumstances, the Commission was not in a position to disburse the last tranche under the third MFA operation. Given that a residual external financing gap remains in Ukraine’s balance of payments over and above the resources provided by the IMF and other multilateral institutions, the Union macro-financial assistance to be provided to Ukraine is, under the current exceptional circumstances, considered to be an appropriate response to Ukraine’s request for support to its economic stabilisation, in conjunction with the IMF programme. The Union’s macro-financial assistance would support the economic stabilisation and the structural reform agenda of Ukraine, supplementing resources made available under the IMF’s financial arrangement. CONTENT: under the proposed Decision, the European Union shall make MFA available to Ukraine for a total amount of up to EUR 1 billion, provided in the form of medium- to long-term loans. The objective of the proposed AMF is to: help Ukraine cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2018-2019 , reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities; provide incentives to step up Ukraine's reform efforts by agreeing with the Ukrainian authorities a Memorandum of Understanding setting out an appropriate package of measures supporting economic adjustment and structural reforms. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. Provided the policy measures attached to each tranche have been implemented in a timely manner, the first instalment is expected to be disbursed in the second half of 2018, while the second instalment could be released in the first half of 2019. All disbursements under the proposed programme, including the first, would be conditional on the implementation of reform measures designed to address vulnerabilities identified in the Ukrainian economy. These reforms, established in a Memorandum of Understanding, will have to take into account the measures of the previous MFA operation that have not yet been implemented, namely the establishment of a system for verifying asset declarations of public officials and a verification of data to be provided by companies on their beneficial owners. The issue wood export ban shall also be examined. The MFA may only be completed if major reforms in the fight against corruption and governance are well implemented. In addition, the Memorandum for the new programme will also include other measures to be implemented by Ukraine in order to receive the first and second disbursement. These will comprise actions in the area of public finance management. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the planned assistance would be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through borrowing operations that the Commission will conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary costs of the assistance will correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed into the guarantee fund for external lending of the EU, from budget line 01 03 06 (“Provisioning of the Guarantee Fund”). Assuming that the first loan disbursements will be made in 2018 for a total amount of EUR 500 million and the second loan disbursement in 2019 for the amount of EUR 500 million, and according to the rules governing the guarantee fund mechanism, the provisioning will take place in the budgets for 2020 (EUR 45 million) and 2021 (EUR 45 million). The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 90.997 million for the period 2017-2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the use of hired vehicles can reduce the costs of undertakings carrying goods on their own account or for hire and reward and at the same time increase their operational flexibility. Directive 2006/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for a minimum level of the market opening for the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road. However, this Directive: allows Member States to restrict the use of hired goods vehicles with a gross vehicle weight above six tonnes for own account operations; restricts the use of a vehicle which has been hired in a Member State different from the one where the undertaking hiring the vehicle is established. The Commission therefore proposes to remove these restrictions and establish a uniform regulatory framework across the EU to ensure equal access for transport operators across the EU to the market for hired vehicles. The proposal is part of a series of proposals in the field of road transport which the Commission intends to adopt in 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option aims to: (i) allow the use of hired goods vehicles for own account operations throughout the EU; (ii) allow the use of goods vehicles which an operator established in one Member State has hired in another Member State for a certain period of time. Expected benefits include: a reduction in operating costs of EU hauliers by a total of EUR 158 million in 2030; a total annual economic benefit of around EUR 240 million in 2030 for the vehicle rental/leasing sector; the creation of almost 5 000 additional jobs (2 900 in the vehicle rental/leasing sector and 1 700 in the road haulage business). CONTENT: the proposal amending Directive 2006/1/EC seeks to: allow the use within its territory of vehicles hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State provided that the vehicle is registered or put into circulation in compliance with the laws of a Member State; allow the use of a vehicle hired in another Member State is to be allowed for at least four months in any given calendar year to enable undertakings to meet temporary or seasonal demand peaks and/or to replace defective or damaged vehicles. By 5 years after the deadline for transposition of the Directive, the Commission shall submit a report on the implementation and effects of this Directive.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: among the main social rules applying to the transport sector are the following: provisions on the organisation of drivers' working time set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; minimum requirements for enforcement set out in Directive 2006/22/EC; rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods under Regulation (EC) No 561/2006; provisions on posting of workers established in Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU. The current evaluation of the social legislation in road transport in the EU has shown shortcomings in the current legal framework and problems regarding enforcement. Furthermore, a number of discrepancies exist between Member States in interpretation, application and implementation of the rules. This creates legal uncertainty and unequal treatment of drivers and operators, which is detrimental to the working, social and competition conditions in the sector. The Commission aims to amend the existing rules in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time mitigating the excessive regulatory burdens on operators and preventing distortions of competition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered. The first policy option focused on clarifying the legal framework and increasing cooperation between enforcement authorities. The second focused on strengthening enforcement and improving working patterns for workers. The third proposed substantive changes in the rules, in particular banning performance based pay. The fourth option comprised sector specific criteria and specific enforcement measures for the posting of workers in the road transport sector. Significant savings for operators result mainly from the latter option, and in particular the measures on administrative and control requirements. These savings are in the range of EUR 785 million per year in administrative costs. CONTENT: the proposal makes a limited number of amendments to Directive 2006/22/EC and lays down sector-specific rules on posting of workers in the road transport sector in relation to Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU. Requirements on enforcement : the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2006/22/EC in order to: require that checks carried out by Member States include checking compliance with the working time provisions set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; require that the information submitted by Member States to the Commission on the results of checks at the roadside and at premises to include checks on compliance with Directive 2002/15/EC; specify that serious infringements giving rise to checks at premises of road transport undertakings shall also include infringements of Directive 2002/15/EC; improve administrative cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of the social rules in road transport has proven insufficient, making cross-border enforcement more difficult, inefficient and inconsistent. It is therefore necessary to establish a framework for effective communication and mutual assistance, including exchange of data on infringements and information on good practices in enforcement; further improve the effectiveness, and consistency of the existing national risk rating systems : the Commission will establish a uniform formula for calculating the risk rating of transport undertakings, and take into account certain criteria, such as the use of the 'smart' tachygraph. Data in the risk rating system must be made available to control authorities. Posting of workers : the Commission proposes that drivers are considered as posted workers if they spend at least 3 days in a given calendar month on the territory of a Member State. All cabotage operations will be considered as posting of workers from day 1 – regardless of their duration. The minimum rate of pay and the minimum annual paid holidays of the host Member State should apply to cabotage irrespective of the frequency and duration of the operations carried out by a driver. For the purposes of the calculation of the periods of posting: a daily working period shorter than six hours spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as half a day; a daily working period of six hours or more spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as a full day; breaks and rest periods as well as periods of availability spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as working period. The proposal lays down the specific administrative requirements and control measures for checking compliance with the provisions on posting of workers in road transport."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: driving and resting times of drivers are regulated under EU law. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (the 'Driving Time Regulation') and Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs are part of a wider effort to improve the working conditions of drivers, ensure fair competition between operators and improve the road safety of European roads. An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‘light commercial vehicles’): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 25 September 2014, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an international agreement with ASECNA establishing the conditions for the provision of a satellite-based augmentation service (SBAS) in Africa on the basis of the EGNOS European satellite navigation programme. The Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation was signed on 5 December 2016, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The European Union and Africa have been cooperating on satellite navigation since the 2011-2013 action plan implementing the Africa-EU strategic partnership. The need for cooperation in this field was reaffirmed in the 2014-2017 roadmap adopted at the Africa-EU summit in April 2014. The European satellite navigation programmes form a key part of European Union transport policy, especially air transport. They have been promoted internationally, mainly as a result of cooperation agreements entered into with countries such as the United States of America, China, South Korea and Israel. CONTENT: this proposal for a Council Decision seeks to authorise the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and ASECNA on the development of satellite navigation and the provision of associated services in ASECNA's area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation. The Agreement establishes a framework for the cooperation required for setting up and operating an independent SBAS system, but based on the European EGNOS system, in ASECNA's area of competence. The aims of this Agreement are to develop satellite navigation and to provide associated services in ASECNA’s area of competence for the benefit of civil aviation by enabling it to benefit from European satellite navigation programmes. The Agreement comprises a technical part and also covers questions of financing and governance. The Union shall assist ASCENA in: The parties shall cooperate on: Financing: the cost of setting up and operating the infrastructure provided for by the Agreement, which belongs to ASECNA, will be financed by ASECNA's budget, by its member states or by contributions, in the form of loans or donations, from countries in the European Union and international financial institutions. In order to set up and operate the SBAS-ASECNA system, the Union will facilitate ASECNA's access to its cooperation and development funds for both current and future programmes. The Agreement provides for the setting up of a joint committee for management and correct implementation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 is put forward in the context of the Commission’s REFIT programme and commitment on better regulation. The European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission confirmed their joint commitment to updating and simplifying legislation in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016. Repealing such legislation keeps the legislative framework transparent, clear and easy to use. Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 was adopted to ensure that the EU’s energy policy develops in an effective way and responds to the EU’s real needs. This Regulation was supported by Commission implementing Regulation (EU) No 1113/2014. Together, these regulations required the Member States to notify the Commission of investment projects for which construction or decommissioning work has started or for which a final investment decision has been taken. Member States have gone through three reporting exercises (2011, 2013 and 2015) since the obligations under this Regulation and its predecessor, Council Regulation No 617/2010, have been in place. In 2016, the Commission carried out the review of Regulation (EU) No 256/2014, including a stakeholder consultation covering all planning and reporting obligations in the energy sector. It concluded that: there were significant overlaps between reporting obligations under Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 and the reporting obligations to the Energy Transmission System Operators ENTSO-E and ENTSO-G; the quality and appropriateness of the information and data received were often poor, and that this information and data had become available to the Commission via other sources. Furthermore, it was noted that the Commission had direct access to market data via its Energy Market Observation System (EMOS). Considering that Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 has therefore not delivered the expected results, the Commission proposes to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to repeal Regulation (EU) No 256/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 concerning the notification to the Commission of investment projects in energy infrastructure within the European Union, replacing Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 617/2010 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) Nº 736/96."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/825 of the European Parliament and of the Council established a structural reform support programme for the period 2017-2020, with a budget of EUR 142.8 million. Its objective is to strengthen the capacity of Member States to prepare and implement growth-sustaining administrative and structural reforms, including through assistance to ensure the efficient and effective use of Union funds. Member States have increasingly taken up support under the programme, beyond the initial expectations. The requests for support received by the Commission during the 2017 cycle have, based on their estimated value, significantly exceeded the available annual allocation. During the 2018 cycle, the estimated value of requests received (EUR 152 million) was five times the financial resources available for that year (EUR 30.5 million). In 2018 almost all Member States (24) have submitted request for support. The Commission considers that the financial allocation of the structural reform support programme should be increased in order to cater for the needs, in particular, of non-euro area Member States, which embark on structural reforms aimed at making their economies more resilient to shocks and better preparing them for euro area membership, as well as for the needs stemming from the increased number and cost of requests for support from all Member States in relation to the implementation of structural reforms. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/825 establishing a structural reform support programme to: indicate the contribution of the programme to facilitating the participation in the euro area of Member States whose currency is not the euro; adapt the overall objective of the programme by stressing that enhancing cohesion, competitiveness, productivity, sustainable growth and job creation should also contribute to preparations for participation in the euro area by those Member States whose currency is not the euro and that want to join the single currency; increase the financial envelope allocated to the programme to EUR 222.8 million at current prices. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the increase of the dedicated financial envelope for the structural reform support programme from EUR 142.8 million to EUR 222.8 million (current prices) should be put in place for 2019 and 2020. This increase should be made possible by using EUR 80.million from the flexibility instrument under the current multiannual financial framework (Article 11 of Council Regulation 1311/2013), which allows for supplementing the financing available in the general budget of the Union for the financial years 2018 and 2019 beyond the ceiling of heading 1b (cohesion). This increased budget will be supplemented by inviting Member States to make use of the possibility, under the structural reform support programme Regulation, of transferring part of their resources from the technical assistance component of the European Structural and Investment Funds to the Structural Reform Support Programme, for the purpose of the provision of support for the implementation of reforms, including reforms linked to euro adoption. Based on current estimates of possible needs for support, this supplement would increase the total amount of the budget available for support to EUR 300 million, thus doubling the support capacity by 2020."

BACKGROUND: relations between the European Union and Armenia are currently based on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, of the other part, which entered into force on 1 July 1999 for an initial ten-year period and which has been automatically renewed. On 29 September 2015, the Council adopted Decisions authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a Framework Agreement between the EU and Armenia. The European Parliament has been kept promptly and fully informed throughout the negotiations. The Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Armenia, of the other part was signed on 24 November 2017, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Council must adopt a decision concluding the Agreement after approval by the European Parliament.

The Agreement aims to strengthen political dialogue by creating an institutional framework and organising cooperation procedures between Armenia and the EU in a wide range of areas. It paves the way for a more effective bilateral relationship with Armenia and is an important step towards increased political and economic involvement of the European Union in the South Caucasus. The Agreement: Although the Agreement is designed to bring Armenian law gradually closer to the EU acquis, it does not go as far as to establish an association between the EU and Armenia."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: with the accession of Croatia, the European Union enlarged its customs union. Consequently, it was required under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules to enter into negotiations with WTO Members having negotiating rights related to the tariff schedule of Croatia in order to eventually agree on a compensatory adjustment. On 15 July 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations under Article XXIV:6 of the GATT 1994. The Commission negotiated with the Members of the WTO holding negotiating rights with respect to the withdrawal of specific concessions in relation to the withdrawal of the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. Negotiations with New Zealand resulted in a draft Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters that was initialled on 18 May 2017 in Geneva. It is now necessary to conclude the Agreement. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Council is called on to adopt a decision on the conclusion of the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and New Zealand pursuant to Article XXIV:6 and Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade1994 relating to the modification of concessions in the schedule of Croatia in the course of its accession to the European Union. In parallel, a separate proposal on the signature of this Agreement is also submitted. Negotiations with New Zealand resulted in the following Agreement: The Commission will adopt implementing Regulations to expand and manage the relevant quotas. These implementation measures are being prepared in parallel to this proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council (on a recommendation from the European Central Bank). ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Article 129(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union enables the European Parliament and the Council, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, and on a recommendation from the ECB or a proposal from the Commission, to amend Article 22 of the Statute of the ESCB. The General Court considered it would be for the ECB to request the European Union legislature to amend Article 22, should the ECB consider that having the power to regulate CCPs is necessary for the proper performance of the task referred to in the fourth indent of Article 127(2) of the Treaty, namely to promote the proper functioning of payment systems. The ECB notes that developments at both global and European level are expected to increase the risks posed by clearing systems, in particular central counterparties, for the proper functioning of payment systems and the implementation of the single monetary policy, which would ultimately affect the Eurosystem’s primary objective of maintaining price stability: firstly, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have a major impact on the Eurosystem’s ability to carry out its tasks as central bank of issue for the euro. At present, CCPs established in the United Kingdom clear significant volumes of euro-denominated transactions. Thus, a significant disturbance affecting a major UK CCP could lead to a severe decrease in liquidity within the euro area; secondly, at the September 2009 summit in Pittsburgh, G20 leaders agreed that all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be cleared through a CCP. These developments have led to a dramatic increase in the scale and importance of CCPs in the Union and globally; thirdly, the European Commission presented its legislative proposal to ensure financial stability and the safety and soundness of CCPs that are of systemic relevance for financial markets across the Union. In order to ensure that the Eurosystem as central bank of issue for the euro can carry out the role envisaged by the legislative proposal, it should have the power to monitor and assess risks posed by CCPs clearing significant amounts of euro-denominated transactions. In the light of these considerations, the ECB considers that it should have the power to regulate clearing systems, in particular central counterparties, in order to fulfil its fundamental tasks. It therefore submits a recommendation for a Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council with a view to amending Article 22 of the Statute of the ESCB in this respect. CONTENT: the ECB recommends that Parliament and the Council adopt a decision amending Article 22 of the ESCB Statute on clearing and payments systems in order to allow the ECB and the national central banks to provide facilities, and to enable the ECB to make regulations, and ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems, and clearing systems for financial instruments, within the Union and with other countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: among the main social rules applying to the transport sector are the following: provisions on the organisation of drivers' working time set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; minimum requirements for enforcement set out in Directive 2006/22/EC; rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods under Regulation (EC) No 561/2006; provisions on posting of workers established in Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU. The current evaluation of the social legislation in road transport in the EU has shown shortcomings in the current legal framework and problems regarding enforcement. Furthermore, a number of discrepancies exist between Member States in interpretation, application and implementation of the rules. This creates legal uncertainty and unequal treatment of drivers and operators, which is detrimental to the working, social and competition conditions in the sector. The Commission aims to amend the existing rules in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time mitigating the excessive regulatory burdens on operators and preventing distortions of competition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered. The first policy option focused on clarifying the legal framework and increasing cooperation between enforcement authorities. The second focused on strengthening enforcement and improving working patterns for workers. The third proposed substantive changes in the rules, in particular banning performance based pay. The fourth option comprised sector specific criteria and specific enforcement measures for the posting of workers in the road transport sector. Significant savings for operators result mainly from the latter option, and in particular the measures on administrative and control requirements. These savings are in the range of EUR 785 million per year in administrative costs. CONTENT: the proposal makes a limited number of amendments to Directive 2006/22/EC and lays down sector-specific rules on posting of workers in the road transport sector in relation to Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU. Requirements on enforcement : the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2006/22/EC in order to: require that checks carried out by Member States include checking compliance with the working time provisions set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; require that the information submitted by Member States to the Commission on the results of checks at the roadside and at premises to include checks on compliance with Directive 2002/15/EC; specify that serious infringements giving rise to checks at premises of road transport undertakings shall also include infringements of Directive 2002/15/EC; improve administrative cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of the social rules in road transport has proven insufficient, making cross-border enforcement more difficult, inefficient and inconsistent. It is therefore necessary to establish a framework for effective communication and mutual assistance, including exchange of data on infringements and information on good practices in enforcement; further improve the effectiveness, and consistency of the existing national risk rating systems : the Commission will establish a uniform formula for calculating the risk rating of transport undertakings, and take into account certain criteria, such as the use of the 'smart' tachygraph. Data in the risk rating system must be made available to control authorities. Posting of workers : the Commission proposes that drivers are considered as posted workers if they spend at least 3 days in a given calendar month on the territory of a Member State. All cabotage operations will be considered as posting of workers from day 1 – regardless of their duration. The minimum rate of pay and the minimum annual paid holidays of the host Member State should apply to cabotage irrespective of the frequency and duration of the operations carried out by a driver. For the purposes of the calculation of the periods of posting: a daily working period shorter than six hours spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as half a day; a daily working period of six hours or more spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as a full day; breaks and rest periods as well as periods of availability spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as working period. The proposal lays down the specific administrative requirements and control measures for checking compliance with the provisions on posting of workers in road transport."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: driving and resting times of drivers are regulated under EU law. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (the 'Driving Time Regulation') and Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs are part of a wider effort to improve the working conditions of drivers, ensure fair competition between operators and improve the road safety of European roads. An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‘light commercial vehicles’): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: rapid technological developments continue to transform the way works and other subject-matter are created, produced, distributed and exploited. New business models and new actors continue to emerge. The objectives and the principles laid down by the Union copyright framework remain sound. However, legal uncertainty remains, for both rightholders and users, as regards certain uses, including cross-border uses, of works and other subject matter in the digital environment. As set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards a modern, more European copyright framework’, in some areas it is necessary to adapt and supplement the current Union copyright framework to ensure that the internal market does not fragment. In this context, the Commission has identified three areas of intervention with the aim of modernising the exceptions and limitations on copyright: (i) digital and cross-border uses in the field of education, (ii) text and data mining in the field of scientific research, and (iii) preservation of cultural heritage. The objective is to guarantee the legality of certain types of uses in these fields, including across borders. Evolution of digital technologies has reinforced the role of the Internet as the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content. In this new framework, rightholders face difficulties when seeking to license their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for measures aiming at improving the position of rightholders to negotiate and be remunerated for the exploitation of their content by online services giving access to user-uploaded content. A fair sharing of value is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of the press publications sector. This proposal is presented in parallel with : a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes; a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines the baseline scenarios, policy options and their impacts for eight topics regrouped under three chapters, namely (i) ensuring wider access to content, (ii) adapting exceptions to digital and cross-border environment and (iii) achieving a well-functioning marketplace for copyright. The assessment concluded that, bearing in mind the predominance of SMEs in the creative sectors, the introduction of a special regime would not be appropriate, as it would defeat the purpose of the intervention. CONTENT: complementing Directive 2010/13/EU and the proposal amending it, this draft directive lays down rules which aim at further harmonising the Union law applicable to copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content. It also lays down rules on exceptions and limitations, on the facilitation of licences as well as rules aiming at ensuring a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject matter. Measures to adapt exceptions and limitations to the digital and cross-border environment : Member States are obliged to provide for mandatory exceptions or a limitation allowing: text and data mining carried out by research organisations for the purposes of scientific research; digital uses of works and other subject-matter for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching, enabling teachers and students will be able to take full advantage of digital technologies; and cultural heritage institutions ((i.e. publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) to make copies of works and other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections to the extent necessary for their preservation. Measures to improve licensing practices and ensure wider access to content: the proposal requires Member States to: put in place a legal mechanism to facilitate licensing agreements of out-of-commerce works and other subject-matter; the cross-border effects will be ensured; put in place a stakeholder dialogue on issues relating to foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms and ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders; put in place a negotiation mechanism to facilitate negotiations on the online exploitation of audiovisual works. Measures to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright : the proposal provides for: a new right for press publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recoupment of their investment and the enforcement of their rights; the rights granted to the publishers of press publications under this Directive should have the same scope as the rights of reproduction and making available to the public provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC, insofar as digital uses are concerned; the possibility for all publishers to receive a share in the compensation for uses of works under an exception; measures to improve transparency and better balanced contractual relationships between authors and performers and those to whom they assign their rights; the obligation for Member States to implement negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the instrument of the European Citizens' Initiative (ECI) was introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon and was made operational on 1 April 2012 by Regulation No 211/2011. The aim of this instrument is to enhance citizens' involvement in the democratic life of the European Union, by allowing them to directly address the Commission with a request to submit a proposal for legal acts of the Union for the purpose of implementing the Treaties. Since its first report on the application of the Regulation adopted in 2015, the Commission has implemented a series of non-legislative measures to facilitate the use of the instrument by organisers and citizens and to mitigate the main problems identified, namely: the difficulties encountered by the organisers in the registration phase including the high rate of refusals to register proposed citizens’ initiatives; the complexity for organisers of initiatives to collect statements of support, as evidenced by the low rate of successful initiatives; differences in requirements for personal data of signatories; low number of initiatives reaching the one million threshold and the limited impact so far generated by citizens' initiatives. The resolution of the European Parliament of 28 October 2015 highlighted a number of problems and called for the revision of Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 and the adoption of a package of amendments to improve the functioning of the ECI. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: no impact assessment has been carried out. The Commission notes, however, that technical and practical measures to simplify the ECI should reduce the administrative burden for both organisers and Member States. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to replace Regulation No 211/2011 with a view to improving the way the ECI operates, with the main policy objectives of: making the ECI more accessible, less burdensome and easier to use for organisers and supporters; achieving the full potential of the ECI as a tool to foster debate and participation , including that of young people, at European level and to bring the EU closer to its citizens. Concretely, the proposal: stipulates the right of every citizen of the Union of at least 16 years of age to support an initiative by signing the statement of support; introduces the requirement to make available an online collaborative platform for the ECI providing a discussion forum as well as information and advice to organisers, support to organisers with regard to the translation of the main elements of their initiatives into all official languages ​​of the Union for publication in the Register; provides for the requirements for the organisers of initiatives, including the formation, composition and responsibilities of the group of organisers composed by at least seven citizens of the Union entitled to vote in the elections to the European Parliament and residents of at least seven Member States; provides that statements of support may only be collected after an initiative has been registered and establishes the requirements for the registration or refusal of initiatives; clarifies that statements of support for initiatives may be collected online or in paper form and that only forms which comply with the models set out in Annex III of the Regulation may be used to collect statements of support. Personal data to be provided by the signatory would be reduced; introduces the requirement for the Commission to set-up and operate, by 1 January 2020, a central online collection system made available free of charge to organisers of registered initiatives and allowing citizens to provide support to initiatives online; stipulates the possibility for organisers to set up their own individual online collection systems, the security and technical features for these systems and the procedure for the verification by the competent national authorities in the Member States; provides that each Member State shall verify and certify the statements of support signed by their nationals; lays down the conditions and time limits for the submission of initiatives to the Commission; sets out the publication and public hearing phase for initiatives submitted to the Commission and sets out the conditions for the public hearing at the European Parliament within three months from the submission of the initiative by the organisers; obliges the Commission to receive the group of organisers at an appropriate level as well as to set out in a Communication its legal and political conclusions on the initiative, the actions it intends to take, if any, and its reasons for taking or not taking action; provides for awareness-raising and communication activities on the ECI to be carried out by the Commission. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the specific budgetary implications of the proposal relate to a number of online systems for the European citizens’ initiative which the Commission will put in place and make available free of charge to citizens and organisers. The estimated impact on expenditure (in commitment appropriations) is estimated at EUR 2.050 million for 2019 and EUR 2.140 million for 2020. For administrative expenditure, the impact is estimated to EUR 1.071 million per year."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC grants equivalence to certain non-EU countries as regards field inspections and production of seed of certain species that are carried out in accordance with Union law. The national provisions governing seed harvested and controlled in these countries afford the same assurances as regards the seed’s characteristics and the arrangements for examining it, for ensuring seed identification, for marking and for control as the provisions applicable to seed harvested and controlled within the European Union. Since Brazil and Moldova are not among these non-EU countries, seed harvested there cannot be imported into the EU. Brazil submitted a request to the Commission that its fodder plant and cereal seed be covered by Council Decision 2003/17/EC as regards the equivalence of such seed. Moldova has submitted a request for the Commission to grant equivalence to its system of field inspections of cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed, and to cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre seed produced and certified in Moldova. After audits of the field inspections and seed certification systems in Brazil and Moldova, the Commission concluded that the requirements and systems in place in these two countries are equivalent to the EU's and provide the same assurances. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Decision 2003/17/EC in order to: grant equivalence as regards field inspections carried out in respect of fodder plant and cereal seed in Brazil, and as regards fodder plant and cereal seed produced in Brazil and officially certified by its authorities; grant equivalence as regards field inspections carried out in respect of cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed in Moldova, and as regards cereal, vegetable and oil and fibre plant seed produced in Moldova and officially certified by its authorities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The negotiations for an Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan have been successfully concluded. The Agreement provides that single distilled shochu, as defined in the Liquor Tax Law of Japan, produced by pot still and bottled in Japan, shall be allowed to be placed on the market of the European Union in traditional bottles of sizes of four go and one sho, corresponding to nominal quantities of 720 ml and of 1800 ml, respectively, provided that other applicable legal requirements of the European Union are fulfilled. Directive 2007/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides that spirit drinks put up in pre-packages may only be placed on the Union market if they are prepacked in the nominal quantities listed in section 1 of the Annex to that Directive. For spirit drinks, section 1 of the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC refers to nine nominal quantities on the interval from 100 ml to 2000 ml. These nominal quantities do not include 720 ml and 1800 ml, the nominal quantities in which single distilled shochu produced by pot still is bottled and marketed in Japan. A derogation from the nominal quantities set out in the Annex to Directive 2007/45/EC for spirit drinks is therefore necessary to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the Union market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a trade sustainability impact assessment of the EPA between the EU and Japan was carried out by the external contractor “London School of Economics Enterprises”. The details of it are provided in Commission proposal for a Council Decision on the signing on behalf of the European Union, of the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. CONTENT: the proposal aims at introducing a derogation from Union rules concerning bottle sizes, for single distilled shochu, a spirit drink produced by pot still and bottled in Japan that is traditionally sold in bottles of sizes of four go or one sho that correspond to nominal quantities of 720 ml (one go corresponds to 180 ml) and 1800 ml, respectively, and that are currently not among the nominal quantities permitted in the Union under Directive 2007/45/EC laying down rules on nominal quantities of prepacked products. This derogation needs to be introduced by an amendment to Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to ensure that single distilled shochu produced by pot still and bottled in Japan may be placed on the market in all Member States simultaneously upon the entry into force of the Agreement."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: since 2004, the European Union has set out to improve the performance of air traffic management (ATM) in Europe by reforming the way air traffic is managed and organised and also by modernising and harmonising the European ATM infrastructure through the Single European Sky (SES) initiative. Sharing the common goal to develop safer and more efficient air transport, in 2011, the European Union and the United States of America signed the Memorandum of Cooperation between the United States of America and the European Union in civil aviation research and development (MoC). The cooperative activities carried out so far under the MoC mainly address ATM particularly cooperation in the field of research and development (R&D) between SESAR and NextGen programme managed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Cooperation under the MoC, in particular between SESAR and NextGen, has reached a high level of maturity and has delivered important results in terms of promoting global interoperability of ATM systems. This led the two parties to explore the potential for extending the scope of cooperation to topics relating to the deployment of ATM systems. On this basis, the Council authorised the Commission on 8 May 2017 to negotiate with the FAA concerning an amendment to the MoC to extend its scope to cover deployment. The Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation NAT-I-9406 between the United States of America and the European Union was signed on 13 December 2017, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to authorise the entry into force of Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation NAT-I-9406 signed by the representatives of the Union and of the United States on the basis of a corresponding Council Decision. The Amendment 1 to the Memorandum of Cooperation extends the scope of cooperation between the Parties to all phases of air traffic management modernisation, including deployment activities, with the goal of ensuring global interoperability and modifies the structure and governance of the Memorandum so as to optimise the implementation and management of the cooperative activities carried out thereunder. The research, development and validation activities related to the MoC will continue to be planned and monitored by the SESAR Joint Undertaking. The deployment activities will be planned and monitored by the SESAR Deployment Manager under the specific grant agreements signed with the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States – with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom – and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU’s common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period. Kosovo is currently listed in Annex I, Part 2 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , i.e. among those entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as states by at least one Member State. Persons from those entities are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. Since launching the visa dialogue in January 2012, the Commission has presented regular reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on its assessment of Kosovo’s fulfilment of the requirements of the roadmap which identified all the legislation and other measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. In its last report, the Commission set out recommendations corresponding to outstanding requirements of the visa roadmap, including four key priorities. It noted the border/boundary delineation agreement with Montenegro should be ratified by Kosovo before visa free status is granted to persons from Kosovo. In its latest report, the Commission observed that Kosovo had taken important steps towards fulfilling the requirement of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and fulfilled sufficient elements of building up its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Based on this assessment and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo, the Commission confirms that Kosovo has met the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap on the understanding that by the day of the adoption of this proposal by the European Parliament and the Council, Kosovo will have ratified the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. CONTENT: taking account of all the criteria which should be considered when determining on a case-by-case basis the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014), the Commission has decided to present a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Kosovo from Annex I, Part 2 (visa-required list) to Annex II, Part 4 (visa-free list). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa exemption will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents (Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004). Territorial provisions : the proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application. The amended Regulation will be directly applicable from the date of its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary. The Commission will continue to actively monitor Kosovo’s process of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and the development of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. (*) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/20016 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987 the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this, stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have agreed, by an interinstitutional agreement dated 20 December 1994, that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. In the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake the codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. The new regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes visa requirements and visa exemptions for third-country nationals entering the EU for a short stay. Common lists: the proposal for a regulation lists third countries whose nationals must have a visa to cross the external borders of a Member State (Annex I to the Regulation). It also lists the countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement for stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period (Annex II of the Regulation). Determination of third countries whose nationals are subject to or exempt from the visa requirement is made on the basis of a case-by-case assessment of various criteria, relating inter alia to: illegal immigration, public policy and security; economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade ; the Union's external relations with the relevant third countries, including, in particular, considerations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. This assessment should be periodic and may lead to legislative proposals to amend the lists in Annexes I and II to the Regulation. Exceptions and exemptions : Member States may grant exceptions to the visa requirement as regards certain categories of persons, e.g. holders of diplomatic passports, service or official passports or special passports, civilian air or sea crewmembers or crew and members of emergency or rescue missions. The following persons may be exempted from the visa requirement: a school pupil having the nationality of a third country listed in Annex I who resides in a third country listed in Annex II or in Switzerland and Liechtenstein and who is travelling in the context of a school excursion as a member of a group of school pupils accompanied by a teacher from the school in question; recognised refugees and stateless persons if the third country where they reside and which issued their travel document is one of the third countries listed in Annex II; Reciprocity mechanism : the Regulation provides for a Union mechanism allowing the implementation of the principle of reciprocity if one of the third countries included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement decides to make the nationals of one or more Member States subject to the visa obligation. That mechanism should provide for a Union response as an act of solidarity, if such a third country applies a visa requirement for nationals of at least one Member State. Suspension mechanism : the proposal also provides for a mechanism for the temporary suspension of the exemption from the visa requirement for a third country included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement in an emergency situation, where an urgent response is needed in order to resolve the difficulties faced by at least one Member State, and taking account of the overall impact of the emergency situation on the Union as a whole. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to ensure the proper participation of the European Parliament and the Council in respect of certain elements of the reciprocity and suspension mechanisms."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process (covering medical, social, economic and ethical issues) and an evidence-based process that independently and objectively assesses a new or existing technology and compares it with other health technologies and / or the current standard of care. Following the adoption of the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive (Directive 2011/24/EU), a voluntary European network of HTAs composed of national HTA agencies or bodies was set up (in 2013) to provide strategic and political guidance to the scientific and technical cooperation at Union-level. While Member States have carried out some joint assessments within the framework of the EU co-funded joint actions, the production of output has been inefficient. Use of the results of the joint actions, including their joint clinical assessments, at Member State-level has remained low. The duplication of assessments on the same health technology by HTA authorities and bodies in different Member States within identical or similar timeframes has not been sufficiently addressed. The European Parliament, in its resolution of 2 March 2017 called on the Commission to propose legislation on a European system for health technology assessment and to harmonise transparent health technology assessment criteria in order to assess the added therapeutic value of medicines. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four policy options were analysed. The preferred option is based on Option 4 (permanent cooperation on common tools, procedures, early dialogues and joint clinical assessments), integrating certain elements of Option 2 (project-based cooperation on HTA activities) as well as some adjustments (e.g. transitional arrangements for Member States and progressive implementation of the product scope for joint clinical assessments). CONTENT: the proposed regulation aims to provide the basis for permanent and sustainable cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments of new medicines and certain new medical devices. Its general objectives are to ensure a better functioning of the internal market and to contribute to a high level of protection of human health. The specific objectives are to improve the availability of innovative health technologies for EU patients, to ensure an efficient use of resources and to improve the quality of HTA across th EU, and to improve business predictability. Member States will be able to use common HTA tools, methodologies and procedures across the EU, working together in four main areas: 1) Joint clinical assessments: these focus on the most innovative health technologies with the most Union-wide and public health impact. These assessments are limited to: medicinal products undergoing the central marketing authorisation procedure, new active substances and existing products for which the marketing authorisation is extended to a new therapeutic indication; and certain classes of medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices which have been selected by the Coordination Group set up under the Regulation. Following the end of a transitional period, participation in the assessments and use of the joint clinical assessment reports at Member State level will be mandatory. Member States will continue to carry out non-clinical assessments (e.g. economic, organisational, ethical) of health technologies and make decisions on pricing and reimbursement. 2) Joint scientific consultations : these allow a developer in the development phase of a health technology to seek the advice of HTA authorities and bodies on the data and evidence likely to be required as part of a potential future joint clinical assessment. 3) Identification of emerging health technologies : This exercise will act as a key input for the annual work programmes, helping to identify at an early stage of their development, the health technologies expected to have a major impact on patients. The Coordination Group will fully consult with all relevant interest groups during this exercise. 4) Voluntary cooperation in other areas : this cooperation could include the assessment of health technologies other than medicinal products or medical devices, non-clinical assessments or collaborative assessments of medical devices not subject to common clinical assessments. Lastly, the proposal lays down common implementing rules in order to ensure harmonisation of the way in which Member States carry out clinical assessments. A key objective of these rules will be to ensure that clinical assessments, whether at EU or at Member State level, are carried out in an independent and transparent manner, free from conflicts of interests. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the implementation of the proposal has no impact on the current Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 as the current cooperation on HTA is financed by the Public Health Programme. The financial impact on the EU budget post-2020 will be part of the Commission's proposals for the next Multiannual Financial Framework. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the Paris Agreement, the world has committed to move towards a low-carbon economy. Until now, the CO2 emission reduction standards for cars and vans in place in Europe have represented a fundamental tool to push for innovation and investments in low carbon technologies. However, in the absence of tighter standards for the period beyond 2020, the EU risks losing its technological leadership in this area. The current CO2 emission standards for cars and vans until 2020/21 have contributed to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from light duty vehicles. However, with current implemented policies GHG emissions are not expected to sufficiently decrease to reach the 2030 EU target of at least 40% emission reduction compared to 1990. This proposal is part of a broader mobility package which includes measures on the demand and supply of low-emission vehicles using alternative fuels through the proposed amendments to Directive 2009/33/EC on clean vehicles, Directive 92/106/EEC on combined transport and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 on passenger coach services. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options were grouped into five key elements. The preferred options within these groups are as follows: CO2 emission targets : to set new EU fleet-wide CO2 targets equal to a 30% reduction in 2030 compared to the 2021 targets, both for cars and for vans; distribution of effort amongst manufacturers from 2025 onwards ; incentives for low- and zero-emission vehicles (LEV/ZEV) : the use of a crediting system whereby a manufacturer exceeding a certain benchmark level of ZEV/LEV would be rewarded by getting a less strict CO2 target; elements for cost-effective implementation : to maintain the eco-innovation provisions, pooling provisions and derogations; strengthening of the governance : to establish an empowerment for the Commission to allow (i) the collection, publication and monitoring of real world fuel consumption data and creating an obligation to report deviations linked to a correction mechanisms and (ii) to correct reported CO2 emission values in case of deviations detected through improved market surveillance. CONTENT: this proposal seeks to set cost-effective CO2 emission reduction targets for new light-duty vehicles up to 2030 combined with a dedicated incentive mechanism to increase the share of zero/low-emission vehicles. More specifically, it will provide a clear signal and predictability for industry to invest, stimulate employment, foster innovation and competitiveness. In concrete terms, the proposed revision: specifies the EU fleet wide CO2 targets applicable to new passenger cars and new light commercial vehicles from 2020, 2025 and 2030. The Regulation shall repeal Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 and shall apply from 2020 in order to ensure a coherent transition to a new target regime starting from 2025. It therefore includes the already established EU fleet wide targets for 2020 of 95g/km (NEDC based) for passenger cars and 147g/km (NEDC based) for light commercial vehicles, as well as new targets for 2025 and 2030. Starting from 2021, the specific emission targets will be based on the new emissions test procedure, the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP); defines the categories of vehicles that fall within the scope of this Regulation by reference to the type approval legislation. It also clarifies that the de minimis exemption applicable to manufacturers responsible for less than 1000 new registrations per year should not apply where a manufacturer eligible for such an exemption nevertheless applies for and is granted a derogation; sets out the general obligation for a manufacturer to ensure that the average CO2 emissions of its fleet of newly registered vehicles in a calendar year do not exceed its annual specific emissions target. Specific targets are laid down in the proposal. From 2025, the specific emissions target for a manufacturer should be calculated taking into account the share of zero- and low-emission vehicles in the manufacturer's fleet; sets out the formula for calculating the financial penalties in case a manufacturer exceeds its target. The excess emission premium from the existing Regulations is maintained, i.e. 95 euro/g CO2/km; maintains the possibility for small volume manufacturers (i.e. those responsible for 1 000 to 10 000 registrations for cars, and 1 000 to 22 000 registrations for vans) to apply for a derogation from their specific emissions targets. provides an empowerment for the Commission to monitor and assess the real world representativeness the WLTP test procedure and to ensure that the public is informed; clarifies the process for adjusting the reference mass value to ensure that the specific emission targets continue to reflect the EU fleet wide target; includes a requirement for the Commission to provide a report in 2024 on the effectiveness of this Regulation, where appropriate accompanied by a proposal. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union as regards the interpretation of the eligibility criteria for derogations, the content of the applications, and the content and assessment of programmes for the reduction of specific emissions of CO2."

In addition to the electronic signature and the advanced electronic signature already provided for in Directive 1999/93 (repealed with effect from 1 July 2016), Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 introduced the possibility of authenticating a document with an electronic seal or an advanced electronic seal based on an electronic seal certificate. Since authentication by an electronic seal rather than an electronic signature is not merely a different electronic system but makes an actual difference in legal terms (in the case of a signature, the authentication method is based on the involvement of a specific natural person; where a seal is used, it is created by the legal person with no indication of who, within the legal person, was responsible for authenticating the document), Regulation No 216/2013 should be amended accordingly. CONTENT: the Commission is proposing to amend Regulation No 216/2013 to allow the Official Journal to be authenticated by an advanced electronic seal based on a qualified certificate in accordance with Regulation 910/2014. The Commission considers that the use of the advanced electronic seal will make it possible to automate electronic signatures and accelerate the procedure for publication on EUR-Lex. The signature will no longer be that of a named official but a recognised body of the European Union, i.e. the Publications Office. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the human resources required will be met by staff from the DG who are already assigned to management of the action and/or have been redeployed within the DG, together if necessary with any additional allocation which may be granted to the managing DG under the annual allocation procedure and in the light of budgetary constraints."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the review of Directive 98/83/EC on drinking water is an extension of the European citizens’ initiative ‘Right2Water’, which collected over 1.8 million signatures and to which the Commission responded positively, urging Member States to do everything they can to ensure everyone has access to a minimum water supply. The Commission also undertook to review the Directive, which, as a result, was included in the Commission’s Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT). The evaluation confirmed that the Directive is the relevant tool to ensure the high quality of the water consumed in the EU, because its basic purpose is to enforce drinking water monitoring and ensure that Member States restore required water quality levels in case of issues. However, the evaluation identified four areas with room for improvement: the list of parameters; the use of the risk-based approach; increased transparency on water-related issues and giving consumers access to up-to date information; and materials in contact with drinking water. The revision is part of the plan to transition to a circular economy. It will help Member States manage drinking water in a resource-efficient and sustainable manner, thereby helping to reduce energy use and unnecessary water loss. It will also help reduce the number of plastic bottles used by improving people’s confidence in tap water. The proposal is fully in line with the Agenda 2030, in particular Sustainable Development Goal 6 and the aims of the Paris Agreement on climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a combination of the preferred options will ensure: high quality drinking water for everyone in the EU ; a more modern approach to monitoring, by using the risk-based approach for both large and small water suppliers; the modernisation, and hence simplification, of reporting provisions; up-to-date and relevant information for consumers; improved access to water, and the provision of access to water for vulnerable and marginalised groups. The costs and the impacts of the proposal will be between EUR 5.9 billion and EUR 7.3 billion. These costs will mainly be borne by water operators. Consumers would see a very marginal increase in their household costs. However, this does not risk making drinking water unaffordable and could be offset by people drinking tap water rather than bottled water. CONTENT: the proposal is a recast of Directive 98/83/EC, which was amended in 2003, 2009 and 2015. Its objective is to improve the quality of and access to drinking water as well as to provide more comprehensive information to citizens. The main elements are: List of parameters set out in Annex : the proposal incorporates the vast majority of parameters and values ​​recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO), while suggesting a different approach for a small number of parameters. The Commission proposes, for example to: (i) retain benzene, cyanide, 1,2-dichloroethane, mercury, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ; (ii) retain the initial values for antimony, boron and selenium ;(iii) set the value for chlorate and chlorite at the stricter level of 0.25 mg/l; (iv) to place three endocrine disrupting compounds (beta-estradiol; nonylphenol; and bisphenol A) into the Directive on the basis of the precautionary principle; (v) reducing the value of chromium by 50 % to 25 µg/l after a transition period of 10 years after the entry into force of the Directive. Risk-based approach : with the new risk-based approach to safety, compliance checks would focus more on those cases where risks are higher. The proposal introduces obligations related to hazard assessment related to bodies of water used for the abstraction of water intended for human consumption, introduces obligations related to carrying out a supply risk assessment by the water supplier, and introduces obligations related to carrying out risk assessments of domestic distribution. Access to drinking water for all citizens, especially for vulnerable and marginalised groups : concretely, this means: (i) informing people who do not have access to drinking water about the possibilities of connection,( ii) encouraging the use of tap water in public buildings and restaurants, (iii) ensuring the availability of equipment allowing free access to tap water in most cities, (iv) quickly informing vulnerable people about the quality of available water and give them the necessary sanitary advice on it. Public information : the proposal aims to: (i) ensure the availability of specified online information on the quality and supply of drinking water and (ii) provide additional specific information directly to consumers (for example on invoices), such as the volumes consumed as well as the detail of the tariff(s) and the cost structure.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the common and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Fund). This Regulation was amended by Regulation (EU) 2017/2305 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the resources allocated for economic, social and territorial cohesion. The general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2018 amended the financial programming for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices and bringing the overall amount of commitment appropriations for the YEI for 2018 up to EUR 350 million in current prices. The amount of commitment appropriations for 2020 needs to be adjusted downwards accordingly to reflect the frontloading to 2018. CONTENT: this proposal is the result of the 2018 budgetary decision. It aims to adapt the amounts of resources available for the investment for growth and jobs goal and for the European territorial cooperation goal set out in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations reflected in Annex VI in order to reflect changes in the financial programming for the YEI. Under this amending proposal, the resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion available for the budgetary commitments for the period 2014-2020 (expressed in 2011 prices), shall amount to EUR 329 982 345 366, in accordance with the annual breakdown set out in Annex VI, of which: EUR 325 938 694 233 represents the global resources allocated to the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund; EUR 4 043 651 133 represents a specific allocation for the YEI . It is also proposed to correct some errors with regard to the amounts and percentages concerning the resources for the investment for growth and jobs goal set out in Regulation (EU) 2017/2305, amending Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. Under the corrective measure, the resources earmarked for the investment for growth and employment goal would amount to 96.09 % of total resources (i.e. a total of EUR 317 073 545 392) and shall be distributed as follows: 51.52 % (a total of EUR 163 359 380 738) for less developed regions; 10.82 % (a total of EUR 34 319 221 039) for transition regions; 16.33 % (a total of EUR 51 773 321 432) for more developed regions; 20.89 % (a total of EUR 66 236 030 665) for Member States supported by the Cohesion Fund; 0.44 % (a total of EUR 1 385 591 518) as additional funding for the outermost regions identified in Article 349 TFEU and the NUTS level 2 regions fulfilling the criteria laid down in Article 2 of Protocol No 6 to the 1994 Act of Accession."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in June 2017, the Commission published a comprehensive fitness check evaluation on reporting and monitoring of EU environment policy and drew up an action plan. This evaluation covered 181 reporting obligations found in 58 pieces of EU environmental legislation. It was found that there is room for improvement on some cross-cutting issues (such as streamlining for a process that is more similar in all Member States) and for specific pieces of legislation: Directive 2007/2/EC (INSPIRE Directive) - Infrastructure for spatial information; Directives 2009/147/EC and 92/43/EEC (i.e. Birds and Habitats Directive); Directive 2010/63/EC (Animal Testing Directive); Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Regulation (E-PRTR)); Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 (Timber Regulation); Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 (CITES); Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (FLEGT Regulation). Issues addressed in the proposal are as follows: the relevance and need for certain reporting obligations is no longer clear; the timing and frequency for reporting obligations does not meet major policy cycle needs; the extending of access to information and the sharing with the public; the roles of the Commission and European agencies are not always clear and explicit; aligning the content, timing and procedures with the evaluation cycle under the Better Regulation agenda. The proposal is therefore designed for the purpose of regulatory fitness and simplification. CONTENT: this proposal for revision of several existing legislative acts falls under the Commission’s Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT). The objectives of this ‘alignment’ proposal are: (i) to improve the evidence base for the implementation of EU environmental policy; (ii) to increase transparency for the public and; (iii) to simplify reporting in order to reduce the administrative burden. The proposal has been developed with a view to ensuring a coherent approach across the different legislative acts, as appropriate: improving transparency and subsidiarity (in 8 legal acts); aligning the timing of reporting (in 3 legal acts); clarifying the role that the Commission and, in some cases, the European Environment Agency plays in the reporting processes (in 8 legal acts); providing factual data for future evaluations (in 5 legal acts)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the post-2020 multiannual financial framework, the Commission intends to propose a new tool to support Member States in the implementation of the structural reforms adopted in the framework of the European Semester. This tool shall have its own budgetary endowment, separate from and in addition to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI). This new reform delivery tool shall seek to support a broad range of reforms such as in product and labour markets, tax reforms, the development of capital markets, reforms to improve the business environment as well as investment in human capital and public administration reforms. The Commission intends to test the main features of this reform delivery tool in a pilot phase for the period 2018-2020, by offering the possibility to Member States to use all or part of the performance reserve in the current European Structural and Investment (ESI) Funds to support reforms instead of specific projects. To this end, the Commission proposes amendments to the Regulation (EU) 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down common provisions on the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI funds). CONTENT: the proposal opens the possibility to partially or fully allocate the performance reserve set up by Article 20 of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to support the reform commitments undertaken by the Members States. A Member State which opts for a partial or full allocation of the performance reserve shall propose to the Commission a detailed set of measures appropriate for the implementation of structural reforms in accordance with Union law. This proposal shall include reform commitments which shall contain milestones and targets for the implementation of the reform measures and a timetable which shall not be longer than three years. The Commission shall adopt a decision, by means of an implementing act , setting out the reform commitments to be implemented by the Member State and the amount allocated from the performance reserve for their support. Support to structural reforms by Member States shall take the form of a financing not linked to cost shall be managed in line with the rules for direct management set out in that Regulation, and shall not require national co-financing. The amount allocated to the implementation of the structural reforms should be proportionate to the nature and importance of the reform and should complement existing Union support to national reforms The Member State shall regularly report within the mechanisms of the European Semester on the progress in the achievement of the reform commitment."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: plastic makes up 80-85% of the total number of marine litter items, measured through beach counts. The 10 most found single-use plastic items represent 86% of all single use plastic items (constituting thus 43% of all marine litter items found on European beaches by count). Fishing gear containing plastics accounts for another 27% of marine litter items found on European beaches. Single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic are therefore a particularly serious problem in the context of marine litter and pose a severe risk to marine ecosystems, biodiversity and, potentially, to human health. Existing Union legislation and policy instruments provide some regulatory responses to address marine litter. However, the impact of that legislation on marine litter is not sufficient and there are differences in the scope and the level of ambition amongst national measures to prevent and reduce marine litter. Therefore, as part of its plastics strategy, the European Commission committed to look into further action to address plastic marine litter that builds on the piecemeal efforts underway in EU Member States, and that follows the approach used of light-weight plastic carrier bags. This initiative focuses therefore on the 10 most found single use plastic items and fishing gear, which together represent around 70% of these marine litter items by count. The initiative should be seen in the broader context of the transition to a circular economy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four scenarios were modelled based on a selection of different measures applied to different items: (i) items for which sustainable alternatives are available. The objective is to promote less harmful alternatives; (ii) items for which there is no alternative. The aim is to limit damages by better informing consumers and making producers financially responsible of environmental consequences; (iii) items which are already well captured. The scenario chosen is that of a ‘medium-high impact on reducing marine litter’ which would address the underlying drivers more adequately and goes further to change consumer behaviour. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to prevent and reduce the impact of certain single-use plastic products and fishing gear containing plastic on the environment and human health as well as to promote the transition to a circular economy with environment-friendly innovative business models, products and materials, thus contributing to the efficient functioning of the internal market. This proposal provides specific objectives and measures for the prevention and management of waste in relation to single-use plastic products that are most found on the beaches in the Union and fishing gear containing plastic. Specifically, the proposal: requires Member States to take the necessary measures to achieve a significant reduction in the consumption of food containers, cups for beverages that are single-use plastic products; lays down restrictions on the placing on the market of certain single-use plastic products for which alternatives exist on the market: plastic cotton buds, cutlery, plates, straws, drink stirrers and sticks for balloons; lays down product design requirements for beverage containers that are single-use plastic products, to ensure that their caps and lids with a significant part made of plastic remain attached to the container during its use stage so that such waste does not leak into the environment; lays down marking requirements for certain single-use plastic products to avoid that they are improperly disposed of, for example through flushing in toilets. This shall apply to sanitary towels, wet wipes and balloons; establishes extended producer responsibility schemes for fishing gear containing plastics and certain single-use plastic products such as food containers, bags and packaging, beverage containers and cups, tobacco products with filters, wet wipes, balloons and lightweight plastic bags. The proposal also lays down specific and additional requirements for the financial responsibility of producers, in particular, for awareness raising campaigns and in the case of single-use plastics also the clean-up of litter; obliges Member States to collect 90% of single-use plastic drinks bottles by 2025, for example through deposit refund schemes; requires Member States to take measures to raise awareness about the impact of littering and inappropriate disposal of waste on the environment, in particular, the aquatic environment and about the available re-use and waste management options. Lastly, the proposal requires Member States to put in place a data set on products subject to a consumption reduction objective in order to monitor the implementation of that consumption reduction objective under this Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: currently, there are no common rules regarding the import of cultural goods from third countries, except Council Regulation (EC) No 1210/2003 concerning certain specific restrictions on economic and financial relations with Iraq and Council Regulation (EU) No 36/2012 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria, which provide for a prohibition of trade in cultural goods with these countries. The initiative aims to complement those two measures and also the existing EU legislation on the export of cultural goods (Regulation (EC) No 116/2009). It aims to prevent the import and storage in the EU of cultural goods illicitly exported from a third country, thereby reducing trafficking in cultural goods, combatting terrorism financing and protecting cultural heritage, especially archaeological objects in source countries affected by armed conflict. The proposal is a follow-up to the 2015 European Agenda on Security and the 2016 Action Plan to step up the fight against the financing of terrorism. It also responds to the European Parliament’s resolution of 30 April 2015 on the destruction of cultural sites by the Islamic State group, which called for strong actions to disrupt the illicit trade in cultural property. At the global level, in March 2017, the G7 culture ministers called on all states to ban the trade in looted cultural property trafficked across borders. In July 2017, G20 leaders affirmed their willingness to put an end to sources of terrorist financing such as looting and smuggling of antiquities. Lastly, the fight against the illicit trade in cultural goods will be a key European action during 2018, European Year of Cultural Heritage. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the selected options would prevent the import and storage in the EU of cultural goods illegally exported from a third country. They involve: raising awareness of potential buyers , including tourists and travellers, as well as of customs and other law enforcement authorities; a regulation providing for customs control measures applying to cultural objects declared for release for free circulation or placement under other special customs procedures (such as free zones), with the exception of goods in transit. CONTENT: the proposal concerns the import into the EU of cultural goods - as defined in the 1995 International institute for the unification of private law (Unidroit) convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects – of a minimum age of 250. For these cultural goods, the person who seeks to introduce them into the Union's customs territory must provide the following documents in order to prove licit provenance, i.e. legality of export from the source country: for archaeological objects, parts of monuments that have been dismembered and for rare manuscripts and incunabula, the person must apply to the competent authority designated for this purpose by the Member State of entry for an import licence, by providing proof of licit export of the goods from the source country; for all other cultural goods , the person must submit to customs a signed statement (affidavit) certifying that the goods were legally exported from the source country, accompanied by a standard Object ID document, describing the object in detail. Customs register and keep a copy of these documents. The proposal also calls on the Member States to: organise cooperation between their competent authorities and provides for the future development of an electronic database to facilitate the storage and exchange of information, in particular importer statements and importer licences issued; foresee penalties for infringements to this Regulation in accordance with their internal legal systems; organise appropriate training sessions for the authorities that they have designated for the implementation of the Regulation, as well as awareness raising campaigns in order to inform potential buyers about the legal framework and dissuade them from purchasing cultural goods from countries thirds whose provenance is not established. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: smaller operators in the food supply chain are more prone to face unfair trading practices (UTPs) due to their, in general, weak bargaining power in comparison to the large operators in the chain. According to a 2013 survey of agricultural producers and agricultural cooperatives based on a wide definition of UTPs, the estimated damage from UTPs amounted to over EUR 10 billion per year. In an agricultural policy environment that has become distinctly more market oriented, the good governance of the food supply chain has become more important for operators, in particular for agricultural producers. The divergence of Member States’ regulatory approaches to UTPs results furthermore in dissimilar conditions of competition for operators. In June 2016, a European Parliament resolution called on the Commission to submit a proposal for a Union legal framework concerning unfair trading practices. In December 2016, the Council invited the Commission to undertake, in a timely manner, an impact assessment with a view to proposing a Union legal framework or non-legislative measures to address unfair trading practices. The proposed measures are complementary to measures existing in Member States and the code of conduct of the SCI (minimum harmonisation approach). The voluntary Supply Chain Initiative (SCI) is a private industry initiative that seeks to govern UTPs. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is partial harmonisation of UTP rules in the EU food supply chain while introducing a common minimum protection standard in the EU to help achieve the objective of reducing the occurrence of UTPs. Concretely formulated prohibitions targeting specific UTPs will also reduce legal uncertainty for commercial transactions that may derive from a more general prohibition. CONTENT: the present proposal for a Directive aims at reducing the occurrence of UTPs in the food supply chain by introducing a minimum common standard of protection across the EU that consists of a short list of specific prohibited UTPs. The protection applies only to SME suppliers in the food supply chain as regards their sales to buyers which are not SMEs. Prohibition of unfair trading practices : Member States shall ensure that the following trading practices are prohibited: a buyer pays a supplier for perishable food products later than 30 calendar days after the receipt of the supplier’s invoice or later than 30 calendar days after the date of delivery of the perishable food products, whichever is the later; a buyer cancels orders of perishable food products at such short notice that a supplier cannot reasonably be expected to find an alternative to commercialise or use these products; a buyer unilaterally and retroactively changes the terms of the supply agreement concerning the frequency, timing or volume of the supply or delivery, the quality standards or the prices of the food products; a supplier pays for the wastage of food products that occurs on the buyer's premises and that is not caused by the negligence or fault of the supplier. Member States shall ensure that the following trading practices are prohibited, if they are not agreed in clear and unambiguous terms at the conclusion of the supply agreement: a buyer returns unsold food products to a supplier; a buyer charges a supplier payment as a condition for the stocking, displaying or listing food products of the supplier; a supplier pays for the promotion of food products sold by the buyer. Designated enforcement authority : the proposal provides that Member States will have to designate a public authority to enforce the new rules. Enforcement authorities are vested with the necessary powers to start an investigation on their own initiative or based on a complaint, to gather information, terminate an infringement and to impose fines and publish the decisions taken to achieve a deterrent effect. They shall be able to deal with confidential complaints and to protect, where requested, the identity of the complainant. Coordination and cooperation between enforcement authorities is foreseen. This covers annual meetings facilitated by the Commission and annual reports that the enforcement authorities will submit. The proposal clarifies that Member States may provide for additional rules designed to combat UTPs going above and beyond this minimum Union standard as long as those rules respect the rules pertaining to the internal market. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal would have a limited impact on the EU budget. It would entail one annual coordination meeting of Member States’ enforcement authorities in Brussels and the creation and management of a basic website for the information exchange by the Commission."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative is part of the Commission's efforts to create an energy union and from a series of proposals on low-emission transport. It is a follow-up to the Communication ""A European strategy for low-emission mobility"". CO2 emissions from road transport in 2014 were still 17% higher than in 1990. The highest share of these emissions originates from passenger cars (over 60%). Under current trends, the emission reduction will not be sufficient to achieve the EU goals set for 2030 and 2050. Moreover, road infrastructure is degrading in many Member States. Road pricing can be a key incentive for cleaner and more efficient transport operations. Progress towards the Commission's objective of applying the ""polluter pays"" and ""user pays"" principles has been slow. There are still inconsistencies in the application of road pricing across the EU. Directive 1999/62/EC provides the legal framework for charging heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) for the use of certain roads. applies to HGVs, all other vehicles are left unaddressed. It is for this reason that the Commission proposed to include buses, passenger cars and vans in the scope of the Directive, thereby ensuring more consistent pricing of infrastructure use across the road transport sector. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option provides for the variation of charges for light vehicles according to their CO2 and pollutant emissions, as the preferred option, possibly complemented with the requirement of external cost charging on at least part of the network for HDVs and the phasing-out of time-based charging for light vehicles over a sufficiently long period. CONTENT: the proposal aims at addressing the shortcomings of existing legislation (Directive 1999/62/EC), i.e. at a better fulfilment of the legislation's objectives. Scope : it is proposed to extend the scope of the application of the Directive to include light duty vehicles such as minibuses, passenger cars, vans and coaches. Tolls and user charges : provisions on non-discrimination, proportionality of charges and on the collection and payment of tolls and user charges shall not only apply to networks mainly used by international traffic (the trans-European road network and motorways) but to other roads. Given that distance-based pricing (tolls) rather than duration (tags) better reflects actual use, emission levels and pollution, the Commission proposes to phasing out tariff systems based on (2023 for heavy-duty vehicles, 2027 for other categories of vehicles). The possibility of exempting heavy goods vehicles weighing less than 12 tonnes from road charging would be abolished and the scope of any tariff system would be extended to coaches / buses. External cost charging : it is proposed that the maximum weighted average external-cost charges should be replaced by readily applicable reference values updated in light of inflation, the scientific progress made in estimating the external costs of road transport and the evolution of the fleet composition. From 1 January 2021, Member States that levy tolls shall apply an external-cost charge to heavy duty vehicles on at least the part of the network where environmental damage generated by heavy duty vehicles is the most important. Congestion charging : the proposal allows the application of congestion charges on top of the infrastructure charge. Any such congestion charge has to be applied to all vehicle categories in a proportionate and even-handed manner. Revenues from congestion charges should be used to address congestion problems, for example by supporting alternative transport solutions or removing bottlenecks. Moreover, the possibility of applying mark-ups would be extended and would no longer be restricted to mountainous regions alone. Variation of charges : as regards heavy duty vehicles, it is proposed to phase out the variation of charges according to the Euro emission class of the vehicle. Modalities for the variation of tolls and user charges according to the environmental performance of passenger cars, minibuses and vans have been specified. The variation shall be based on emissions of both CO2 and air pollutants, as specified in Annex VII. This provision should incentivise the use of cleaner and more efficient vehicles. Notifications : it is proposed to simplify the prior information of the Commission in respect of intended external cost charging, by confining the information to basic elements. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2009/33/EC on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road vehicles (the Clean Vehicles Directive) makes it mandatory to account for operational lifetime energy and environmental impact in the public procurement of road transport vehicles. An ex-post evaluation carried out in 2015 showed that the Directive has serious shortcomings (e.g. limited scope, lack of definition, inaccuracy or extreme complexity of the provisions on the purchase of vehicles). So far, public bodies have only purchased small volumes of clean vehicles. Public procurement remains relevant as a demand-side stimulus, including in the field of heavy-duty transport vehicles where no legislative requirement for reducing CO2 emissions exists yet. This is why the Commission is presenting a new initiative to increase the market uptake of clean vehicles in the context of public procurement. Currently, the uptake is very low: in 2017, in 16 Member States the proportion of battery-electric vehicles in new car registrations was less than 1%, and in 10 Member States it was less than 0.5%. The proposal builds on the Commission's European strategy for low-emission mobility, adopted in July 2016. It confirms that, in order to meet the commitments made by the EU at COP21 held in Paris in 2015, the decarbonisation of the transport sector must be accelerated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is to introduce a definition of clean vehicles based on emission thresholds and setting up minimum procurement target for light-duty vehicles and combining it with a definition based on alternative fuels and setting up minimum procurement targets for heavy-duty vehicles. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to revise the Clean Vehicle Directive to ensure that the Directive covers all relevant procurement practices, provides for clear and long-term market signals and that provisions are simplified and effective. The proposal is limited to the establishment of a common policy framework with minimum requirements for the award of contracts for clean vehicles, while leaving Member States flexibility in terms of implementation, including in the choice of technology. In concrete terms, the proposed revision: extends the scope of the Directive to forms of public procurement other than purchasing, namely the leasing, rental or hire-purchase and to public service contracts for public road transport, special purpose road services, non-scheduled passenger transport and bus and coach hire; sets a definition for clean light-duty vehicles based on a combined CO2 and air pollutant emissions threshold; sets, in terms of public procurement for clean vehicles, minimum targets differentiated by Member State and segmented by vehicle category according to both CO2 emission thresholds and air pollutants (light-duty vehicles) and the use of alternative fuels (heavy-duty vehicles), as included in the Annex and set from the dates mentioned therein; introduces a framework for reporting and follow-up : the first intermediate reporting in 2023 and full reporting in 2026 on the implementation of the targets for 2025 and every three years thereafter. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in order to update provisions for CO2 emission standards of heavy duty vehicles once the related heavy-duty CO2 emission performance standards are in force at Union level."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The objectives of the CFP are, inter alia, to ensure that fishing and aquaculture are environmentally sustainable in the long term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. For the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, a number of conservation measures are to be adopted as appropriate in any combination thereof, such as multi-annual plans, technical measures, fixing and allocation of fishing opportunities. The fisheries of the Western Waters and adjacent areas are highly complex , involving vessels from at least seven coastal Member States, using a wide variety of different fishing gears to target a wide range of different fish and shellfish species. A key issue is that many of the most important demersal stocks (i.e. those that live on or near the bottom of the sea) are caught in mixed fisheries. Council Regulations (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) 509/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008 and (EC) No 1342/2008 set out the rules for the exploitation of the northern stock of hake, hake and Norway lobster stocks in the Cantabrian Sea and by the Western Iberian Peninsula, sole in the Bay of Biscay, sole in the Western Channel, herring in the West of Scotland and cod in the Kattegat, the North Sea in the West of Scotland and the Irish Sea. These and other demersal stocks are taken in mixed fisheries. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a single multi-annual plan taking into account such technical interactions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: of the three legislative options examined, a single multi-annual plan for mixed fisheries covering all Western Waters has been chosen. This option received the highest scores on the following criteria: (i) effectiveness and efficiency; (ii) reduction of administrative burden; (iii) achievement of the overall main objectives of the CFP; (iv) providing a management framework that promotes stability and predictability. CONTENT: in accordance with the overall ambition of the CFP on the conservation of fisheries resources and with specific regards to the Basic Regulation which require the development of multi-annual plans, the main elements of the plan are: Scope : the scope of the plan is demersal stocks, including deep-sea stocks, in the Western Waters and the fisheries exploiting those stocks. The plan also covers implementation of the landing obligation and technical measures for all stocks and the fisheries exploiting those stocks in the Western Waters. Objectives : the plan shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the common fisheries policy, in particular by applying the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and shall aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains populations of harvested species above levels which can produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The plan shall contribute to: (i) the elimination of discards, by avoiding and reducing, as far as possible, unwanted catches, and to the implementation of the landing obligation for the species which are subject to catch limits and to which this Regulation applies; (ii) implementing the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management in order to ensure that negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem are minimised. Targets : objectives and targets should be quantifiable. The proposed targets are expressed as fishing mortality ranges around FMSY as advised by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). These FMSY ranges allow for a maximum sustainable yield-based management for the stocks concerned, and appear to allow for adaptations in case of changes in the scientific advice, while at the same time preserving a high level of predictability. Safeguard measures : safeguards and specific conservation measures are linked to the conservation reference points. Appropriate safeguard measures should be envisaged in case the stock size falls below these levels. Safeguard measures should include the reduction of fishing opportunities and specific conservation measures when scientific advice states that remedial measures are needed. The plan provides for the periodic assessment of the impact on the stocks concerned, on the basis of scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the common fisheries policy (CFP) seeks to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term, to apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and to implement the ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management. Scientific advice from the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) and from the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean’s Scientific Advisory Committee (GFCM — SAC) has indicated that the exploitation of anchovy and sardine stocks in the Adriatic Sea exceeds the levels required to achieve the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). The vast majority are being caught by Italy and Croatia, in the northern part of the Adriatic. Currently, small pelagic fisheries in the Adriatic Sea are governed by several legal frameworks, at national, EU and international level. This proposal addresses the problem of overexploitation of small pelagic stocks due to an unsustainable fishery and ineffective governance. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option was the one which called for an EU Regulation to manage small pelagic fisheries. This option should lead to an improved conservation status of anchovy and sardine, which would ultimately result in a healthier and more sustainable fishing sector dependent on this resource, with better salaries for individual fishers and greater profitability overall compared to the status quo. CONTENT: the proposed plan seeks to replenish stocks such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel and horse mackerel and contribute to their sustainable use, as well as to establish a simpler and more comprehensive management framework. The plan should: facilitate the introduction of the landing obligation by providing a basis for derogations in certain circumscribed situations; enable regionalisation to be used, whereby Member States around sea basins are involved in the conception and design of management rules for the interested parties. The multiannual-plan will apply to all EU fishing vessels irrespective of their overall participation in fishing in the Adriatic Sea (in EU and international waters). It shall include: target fishing mortalities expressed in ranges for each of the stocks, where available, which would be the basis for setting annual catch limits for those stocks; safeguard measures to give a framework to restore stocks when they fall below safe biological limits; control provisions are provided on the vessel monitoring system, prior notification, electronic logbooks and designated ports. Regarding electronic logbooks and the vessel monitoring system, the provisions included in Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 are extended to cover all vessels over eight metres in length, to improve control of the fisheries covered by the multiannual plan. The plan should be evaluated every five years on the basis of scientific advice."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European strategy for low-emission mobility sets a clear ambition: by mid-century, greenhouse gas emissions from transport will need to be at least 60% lower than in 1990 and be firmly on the path towards zero. Emissions of air pollutants from transport that harm our health need also to be drastically reduced without delay. Light-duty vehicles (LDV) – passenger cars and light commercial vehicles (vans) - are already delivering their share of emission reductions and legislation has been proposed in 2017 so that they continue doing so after 2020. Lorries carry around 70% of freight transported over land, delivering also essential public services. While CO2 emissions from heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), i.e. lorries, buses and coaches, account for about 6% of total EU emissions and 25% of road transport CO2 emissions in the EU, they are currently not regulated at EU level. This poses three main problems: without any further action, CO2 emissions from HDV are projected to grow by 9% over the period 2010– 2030 due to increasing transport activities ; transport operators, mainly SMEs or micro enterprises, and their clients currently miss out on possible fuel savings and reduced fuel bills; EU HDV manufacturers face increasing global competitive pressures as the United States, Canada, Japan and China have already implemented regulatory measures to reduce HDV CO2 emissions. However, it is necessary for the EU car industry to keep up with the technological improvements introduced in these markets. This proposal is part of the third ‘Europe on the move’ package which delivers the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017. The aim of the package is to make European mobility safer and more accessible, European industry more competitive, European jobs more secure and the mobility system cleaner and better adapted to the imperative of tackling climate change. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options considered in the impact assessment are grouped into five key elements, aimed to address the identified problems and achieve the policy objectives: (i) EU fleet-wide CO2 emission targets; (ii) distribution of EU fleet-wide target across vehicle groups and manufacturers; (iii) incentives for zero and low-emission vehicles; (iv) elements for cost-effective implementation; and (v) governance related issues. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation sets CO2 emission performance standards for new heavy-duty vehicles whereby the specific CO2 emissions from the EU fleet of new heavy-duty vehicles are reduced compared to the reference CO2 emissions as follows: from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2029 by 15 %; from 1 January 2030 by at least 30 %, subject to review in 2022. The targets are set as a relative reduction of the average specific emissions of the vehicles registered in the reference year 2019 which is the first year for which official monitored CO2 emissions data will be available. The targets are attributed to each vehicle sub-group as defined in Section 1 of Annex I. In addition, the proposal: · defines the vehicles that fall within the scope of this Regulation by reference to the relevant categories defined in type approval legislation and to the four vehicle groups for which certified CO2 emissions data will be available from 2019 onwards; · provides that the Commission shall determine and publish annually the average specific CO2 emissions of each manufacturer starting from 2019 on the database provided by the relevant manufacturers; incentivises the deployment of zero- and low-emission heavy-duty vehicles, those vehicles shall be counted multiple times for the purpose of determining a manufacturer’s average specific emissions starting from 2019. A specific incentive is also provided for zero-emission heavy-duty vehicles of the categories M2 (buses) and M3 (coaches) as well as certain category N vehicles (small lorries), including zero-emission vocational vehicles; provides for the calculation of annual manufacturer specific emission targets for the preceding calendar year, starting in 2026. The first annual targets will therefore be determined for the calendar year 2025; sets out a ‘banking and borrowing’ mechanism, allowing a manufacturer to balance an underachievement of its specific emission target in one year by the overachievement in another year. For that purpose, the manufacturer may ‘bank’ emission credits, if its emissions are lower than a reduction trajectory determined as a linear trajectory from the 2019 reference CO2 emissions to the 2025 targets and from the 2025 targets; imposes financial penalties in case of non-compliance with the specific CO2 emission targets. The level of the premium is set at EUR 6 800 per g/tkm, equivalent to EUR 570 per g/km based on an average payload of 12 tonnes, of excess emissions which reflect the marginal cost of CO2 reducing technologies. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the budgetary impact resulting from the implementation of the proposed Regulation is very limited. It is estimated at EUR 1.888 million for the years 2019-2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: the evaluation of Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship (""Written Statement Directive"") has highlighted weaknesses in the scope of the Directive and indicated how its effectiveness could be improved. This Directive no longer corresponds to the evolution of the labour market, in particular as regards the new ""non-standard"" forms of employment which have appeared in the last ten years. Since 2014, more than five million jobs have been created, of which almost 20% in new forms of employment. The adaptability of new forms of employment to changes in the economic context has enabled new business models to develop, including in the collaborative economy, and has offered entry into the labour market to people who previously would have been excluded. In response some Member States have put in place new regulations and national social partners have developed new collective agreements, leading to an increasingly diverse regulatory system across the EU. This initiative is one of Commission's key actions to follow up on the European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017. It also responds to the resolution of the European Parliament of 19 January 2017 requesting a framework Directive on decent working conditions in all forms of employment, and of 4 July 2017 on working conditions and precarious employment, calling for a revision of the 1991 Directive to take account of new forms of employment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred combination of measures shows that a substantial improvement of working and living conditions is expected. Most notably, at least 2-3 million non-standard workers will enter into the scope of the Directive. Enhanced predictability for some 4-7 million workers should have a positive impact on work-life balance and health. Some 14 million workers might request a new form of work. Lack of exclusivity clauses will allow some 90 000-360 000 on-demand workers to seek additional work and earn EUR 355-1 424 million per year extra. Non-quantified benefits for employers include higher retention and loyalty, improved worker relations, fewer complaints and court cases, better resource planning, contributing to an overall increase in productivity. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to replace the 1991 Written Statement Directive with a new instrument that ensures transparency about working conditions for all workers and defines new substantive rights to improve predictability and security of working conditions, particularly for those in precarious employment. The proposal: extends the scope of the Directive to forms of employment which are today often excluded , such as domestic work, casual workers (for instance those carrying out on-demand or intermittent work), short-term employees, domestic workers, platform workers or voucher-based workers. Member States could decide to exclude very short-term assignments of less than 8 hours per month from the scope of the Directive; provides that workers will receive up-to-date and detailed information (paper or electronic) from their first day of work. This information will cover: (i) probation (if any); (ii) training provided by employer; (iii) arrangements and remuneration for overtime; (iv) information on working time for workers on very variable schedules; (v) social security institution where contributions are paid; establishes minimum rights that apply to all workers in the Union : (i) limit the length of probationary periods to 6 months, unless longer is objectively justified; (ii) right to work for other employers, with a ban on exclusivity clauses and restrictions on incompatibility clauses; (iii) right to predictability of work: workers with variable working schedules determined by the employer (i.e. on-demand work) should know in advance when they can be requested to work; (iv) possibility to request a more stable form of employment and to receive a justified written reply (within 1 month; for SME's within 3 months and orally for repeated requests); (v) right to cost-free mandatory training; introduces two alternative procedures for addressing missing information : positive presumptions (if no relevant information supplied, no probation, permanent and/or full time employment relationship); administrative procedure to issue injunction to employer to supply missing information. The proposal also introduces provisions based on existing social acquis on compliance, right to redress, prevention of adverse treatment, burden of proof on dismissal, and penalties are introduced."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007, which entered into force in December 2009, rail passengers have rights to information, reservations and tickets, assistance, care and compensation in the event of a delay or cancellation, free of charge assistance (for persons with disabilities), compensation in the event of an accident or quick access to a complaint handling system. In its 2013 report on the application of the Regulation, the Commission highlighted certain problematic areas which were confirmed by an impact assessment in 2016/2017. With this proposal to recast the existing legislation, the Commission wishes to better protect passengers no matter where they travel in the EU. It aligns rail with general aspects of passenger rights legislation on other transport modes, notably non-discrimination, contingency planning, disability training, complaint handling and enforcement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were broken down, in a sequential approach analysing and comparing costs and benefits and selecting a preferred policy scenario per theme: (i) exemptions; (ii) the applicability of the rights of persons with reduced mobility to all services; (iii) information for persons with reduced mobility; (iv) assistance to persons with reduced mobility; (v) handling of complaints and monitoring of enforcement by national enforcement agencies; (vi) definition of throughticket; (viii) force majeure; (ix) information for all travellers; (x) non-discrimination. CONTENT: the main elements of proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 are as follows: Uniform application of rules : to date, many Member States have frequently used national exemptions, which deprive travellers to a large extent of their rights. The proposal: removes exemptions for long-distance domestic services by 2020; removes exemptions for cross-border urban, suburban and regional services; requires that Member States grant exemptions only if they can prove that passengers are adequately protected on their territory. The Commission proposal updates the existing rules on rail passenger rights in five key areas: Information and non-discrimination : in order to improve provision of information about passenger rights at booking, the proposal: requires such information to be printed on the ticket or electronically. Notices informing passengers of their rights have to be placed in prominent positions in stations and on board; provides for passengers to be given fuller information on through tickets. Railway undertakings and ticket vendors have to make efforts to offer through tickets. They must prove that they informed passengers where their passenger rights do not apply to the whole journey but only to its segments; introduces a general clause prohibiting any form of discrimination, e.g. based on nationality, residence, location or currency of payment. Better rights for persons with disabilities or reduced mobility : mandatory right to assistance on all services and full compensation for loss or repair of mobility equipment. Relevant information has to be given in accessible formats and rail staff must receive disability awareness training. Enforcement, complaint-handling and sanctions : the proposal clarifies the procedure and deadlines for passengers to lodge complaints. It specifies the responsibilities of national enforcement bodies in cross-border cases and requires them to cooperate effectively. Force majeure : in 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the current Regulation does not allow for railway undertakings to be exempted from compensating passengers for delays caused by force majeure, thus creating a distinction between rail and other modes of transport. The proposal introduces a 'force majeure' clause which would exempt railway undertakings from paying compensation for delays only in very exceptional situations caused by severe weather conditions and natural disasters. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the POPs Regulation) implements the commitments of the Union under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (the Stockholm Convention) approved by Council Decision 2006/507/EC and under the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs Protocol). The recast of the POP Regulation is proposed for the following reasons: in view of the procedural changes introduced by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the 'Lisbon Treaty'), it is necessary to adapt the provisions of the POPs Regulation concerning comitology by specifying which rules are subject to implementing acts and clarified which conditions apply to the adoption of delegated acts; in order to support the Commission in its tasks foreseen under the POPs Regulation, it is proposed to: (i) involve the European Chemicals Agency in certain administrative, technical and scientific tasks necessary for the implementation of the Regulation; (ii) support the enforcement of the POPs Regulation by Member States by including a coordination role for the Forum for Exchange of Information on Enforcement established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (REACH); in light of the experience of the functioning of the procedures under the POPs Regulation, it is proposed to include certain technical amendments to the operative provisions, such as clarifying existing definitions and adding the definitions of manufacturing, use and a closed-system site-limited intermediate and to update the provisions of the reporting requirements. The proposal contributes to the achievement of priority objective 3 of the 7th Environment Action Programme to 2020: ‘to safeguard the Union’s citizens from environment-related pressures and risks to health and well-being’. CONTENT: the recast proposal contains provisions concerning the monitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and the reporting of information on their manufacture, use and emissions. It also lays down obligations on the monitoring of the application of the POP Regulation. It also requires the establishment and regular review of an implementation plan for the Stockholm Convention. The proposed recast Regulation would essentially maintain all provisions of the current POPs Regulation, including those that go beyond the requirements of the Stockholm Convention and the POPs Protocol. In order to enhance clarity and improve the functioning of the Regulation. The main changes are as follows: Clarification of definitions : the definitions for ‘placing on the market’, ‘article’, ‘substance’, ‘waste’, ‘disposal’ and ‘recovery’ have been amended. The term ‘preparation’ has been replaced by ‘mixture’ to reflect the changes in the general chemicals legislation. It has also been proposed to add definitions for 'manufacturing', 'use' and 'closed-system, site-limited intermediate'. Involvement of the European Chemicals Agency : a role for the Agency in the implementation of this Regulation has been proposed due to the Agency's expertise and experience with the implementation of general chemicals legislation and international agreements on chemicals, in particular regarding its current involvement in REACH and Regulation (EU) No 649/2012. It is proposed that the role of the Agency will include its involvement in the technical preparation of dossiers on substances that may be used by the Commission, should it use its discretion to propose one or more such substances to be listed as POPs in the Stockholm Convention. In particular, the Agency will take action where substances are considered to fulfil the criteria in Annex D of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, the Commission, the Member States and the Agency should cooperate to implement effectively the Union's international obligations under the Convention. Role of the REACH ‘Forum’ : the Forum is a network of authorities responsible for the enforcement of REACH, Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 (CLP) and Regulation (EC) 649/2012 (PIC) in the EU. As a result of the experience it has accrued in relation to those chemical regulations, it is deemed appropriate to propose a role for the Forum in coordinating the enforcement tasks specified in this Regulation. Comitology : in order to take account of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, it is proposed to revise the provisions by which certain powers are conferred on the European Commission. Reporting and monitoring : the recast includes certain adjustments, in particular with regard to streamlining, simplifying and automatising the reporting and monitoring process, and improving the provision of public information. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposal is not expected to have important budgetary implications since no new tasks were introduced compared to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004. The transfer of certain tasks from the Commission to the Agency is expected to have no significant impact on the overall costs of implementation. Reductions are expected to be achieved in the medium-term considering the potential for synergies with other existing tasks of the Agency. The financing of the tasks carried out by the Agency will be provided in form of a subsidy from the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: type-approval requirements applying to 'L-category vehicles' as of 1 January 2016 are set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 and its four delegated and implementing acts. The term ‘L-category vehicles’ covers a wide range of light vehicle types with two, three or four wheels, e.g. powered cycles, two- and three-wheel mopeds, two- and three-wheel motorcycles, motorcycles with side-cars and four-wheel vehicles (quadricycles) such as onroad quads, all-terrain vehicles and quadrimobiles. On the basis of the Commission report to the European Parliament and the Council on the comprehensive effect study of the environmental step Euro 5 for L-category vehicles and taking into account issues encountered by approval authorities and stakeholders in applying that Regulation, certain changes and clarifications should be made in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 in order to ensure its smooth application. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 168/2013 regarding the requirement to install an on-board diagnostic system (OBD I) which monitors for any electric circuit and electronics failure of the emission control system and which is triggered when the emission thresholds are being exceeded. OBD stage I systems for those vehicle (sub-) categories shall also report the triggering of any operating mode which significantly reduces engine torque. It is necessary to clarify the exemption for mopeds (L1e and L2e categories) from the OBD system of stage II requirement and to extend that exemption to light quadricycles (L6e category) and to the enduro (L3e-AxE) and trial (L3e-AxT) motorcycle subcategories. Regarding the requirement to install an on-board diagnostic system (OBD) of stage II, the Commission concluded on the basis of the comprehensive environmental effect study that there are technical limitations with respect to catalyst monitoring for certain vehicles and that further development is required to ensure its correct implementation. Catalyst monitoring is not expected to be ready for the first round of the Euro 5 emission step, but should be envisaged for 2025. The amending Regulation therefore provides for the time necessary to ensure the correct implementation of OBD system of stage II requirement. In addition, the European Commission would have additional powers to adopt delegated acts to implement Regulation (EC) No 168/2013: the powers initially granted expired on 21 March 2018. The proposal provides for an extension of the delegation for a further five years, with the possibility of tacit extension."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement and that departments should endeavour to codify at even shorter intervals the texts for which they are responsible, to ensure that their provisions are clear and readily understandable. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed by an Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast-track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: in the interests of clarity and rationality, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005 concerning trade in certain goods which could be used for capital punishment, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The proposed new Regulation will supersede the various acts incorporated in it. It fully preserves the content of the acts and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Prohibition of exports and imports : the proposed Regulation prohibits exports and imports of goods (listed in Annex II of the Regulation) which have no practical use other than capital punishment or torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It also prohibits a supplier of technical assistance or a broker from supplying or offering such goods to third countries. Furthermore, it prohibit both the promotion of such goods in trade fairs or exhibitions in the Union, and the sale or purchase of advertising space in print media or on the Internet and of advertising time on television or radio in relation to such goods. Obligation of an export licence : for goods which may be used to inflict torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (listed in Annex III to the Regulation) or to inflict capital punishment (listed in Annex IV to the Regulation), an export authorisation is required, irrespective of the provenance of the goods. The competent authority shall not grant an authorisation if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the goods could be used for the above purposes. Authorisations : authorisations for export, import or transit shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex VII. Authorisations concerning brokering services shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex VIII. Authorisations concerning technical assistance shall be issued on a form consistent with the model set out in Annex IX. Such authorisations shall be valid throughout the Union. The period of validity of an authorisation shall be from three to twelve months with a possible extension of up to twelve months. The period of validity of a global authorisation shall be from one year to three years with a possible extension of up to two years. The Regulation allows competent authorities to refuse to grant an authorisation and to cancel, suspend, modify or withdraw an authorisation they have already granted. The competent authorities, acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an authorisation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an authorisation which they have already granted. If no authorisation has been granted, the authorities shall detain the goods declared and shall make the exporter or importer aware of the possibility to apply for an authorisation. If no application for an authorisation is made within six months of the detention, or if the competent authority dismisses such an application, the customs authorities shall dispose of the detained goods in accordance with applicable national law."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: The Commission has committed funds to Member States' national programmes under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601 establishing provisional measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece. Decision (EU) 2015/1601 was amended by Council Decision (EU) 2016/1754 to take account of legal admissions from Turkey. The Council decisions allowed the effective relocation, from Greece and Italy, of 34 705 applicants in need of international protection, as well as the legal admission, from Turkey, of 5 345 persons in need of international protection. These decisions have since ceased to apply. Of the EUR 843 million committed in 2016 to Member States' national programmes under the AMIF, some EUR 567 million are still available. However, payments should be made for these commitments before the end of 2018, after which the amounts will no longer be available to Member States for their national programmes under the AMIF. The Commission considers that Member States should be able to use the amounts available to continue to relocate by recommitting these amounts to the same action in national programmes or to allocate these amounts to other actions in the fields of migration and asylum, once the Council decisions are no longer valid. In addition, the target group of persons eligible for relocation should be broadened so that Member States have greater flexibility in the relocations they carry out. The AMIF is an important tool to complement EU actions in the fields of borders and security, in particular because it provides financial support for the establishment and operation of reception and registration centres (hotspots). Member States' needs in these areas remain considerable. CONTENT: The proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 516/2014 establishing the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) aims to allow Member States to re-commit or transfer amounts within national programmes, through revisions to these national programmes, so as to promote EU priorities in the areas of migration and asylum, including relocation. In practical terms, the proposal: extends the period for the use of the funds concerned - by two years from the date of the approval by the Commission of the revised national programmes - in order to give Member States sufficient time to implement the actions to which the amounts have been re-committed or transferred; extends the target group of persons eligible for resettlement under the current AMIF, i.e. beneficiaries of international protection, to include applicants for international protection who are being transferred; makes it possible to re-commit amounts committed to supporting the implementation of Council decisions for the purpose of relocations, or to transfer these amounts to other actions defined in the Regulation establishing the AMIF, according to the needs of the Member States. Such re-commitment or transfer operations would be possible only once and would have to be duly justified in the context of a revision of the national programmes, which would have to be approved by the Commission; extends by a maximum of six months the deadline for decommitment of the remaining amounts committed to support the implementation of Council Decisions (EU) 2015/1523 and (EU) 2015/1601, so that Member States have sufficient time to review national programmes and make changes related to possible re-commitments or transfers of amounts."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. On 30 July 2009, the European Union signed the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, which establishes a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement. The Interim Partnership Agreement has been provisionally applied by Papua New Guinea and by Fiji since 20 December 2009 and 28 July 2014, respectively. On 5 February 2018, Samoa submitted an accession request together with a market access offer to the Council. The Commission found Samoa's offer acceptable and concluded negotiations with Samoa on 23 April 2018. Samoa's accession should now be approved on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission invites the Council to approve, on behalf of the Union, Samoa's accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Samoa and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Samoa's exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Samoa from paying customs duties. It satisfies the criteria established in Article XXIV of the GATT 1994 (to eliminate duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce with respect to substantially all trade between the parties) i.e.: 80 % of EU exports are covered in 15 years. Samoa will benefit from maintaining their duty-free quota-free market access into the EU market. The EPA also establishes a set of disciplines in the areas of sustainable development; technical barriers to trade; and Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures among others. There is a possibility for the EU to avail itself of the bilateral dispute settlement mechanism foreseen under the Agreement. Samoa graduated from the Least Developed Countries category in 2014; as such it continues to benefit from the 'Everything But Arms' initiative which offers its exports duty-free quotafree market access into the EU for a transitional period ending on 31 December 2018. As of then, the standard form of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) will apply to Samoa's exports to the EU, which is however less generous than the EBA. To maintain full duty-free-quota-free access to the EU market, Samoa would need to have joined the existing EPA between the EU, Fiji and PNG as of 1 January 2019. It is therefore foreseen that the EU and Samoa shall provisionally apply the Agreement subject to notifying each other in writing of the completion of the procedures necessary for this purpose in accordance with Article 76(3) of the Agreement. The scope of the agreement does not cover tax good governance. The Commission will use the context of the EPA Committee meeting to raise with the Samoan authorities their situation towards the EU list, in particular to advocate for tax reforms in line with the EU listing criteria. The proposal provides that the approval of the accession must not be construed as conferring rights or imposing obligations which can be directly invoked before Union or Member State courts or tribunals."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the secondary movements of irregular migrants and the increase of cross-border terrorist threats posing a serious threat to the internal security of a number of Schengen States, some Members States have been compelled to extend the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls. Based on the current Schengen rules, border controls at internal borders are possible for longer than six months when there are serious deficiencies in the external border management of a Member State, as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation. In situations where the serious threat to public policy or internal security is not related to deficiencies in the management of the external borders as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is subject to the conditions and time limits set out in the Schengen Borders Code. While the current rules for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls have proved sufficient in the vast majority of cases, the maximum periods laid down in the legislation may not be sufficient when Member States face serious and persistent threats to public order or internal security. This is why the Commission considers it necessary to adapt the maximum periods for the temporary reintroduction of border checks to current needs, while ensuring that the use of this measure remains exceptional and is decided only as a last resort. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to update the Schengen Borders Code to prolong the time limits for internal border controls. Stronger procedural safeguards are also being introduced to ensure that border controls at internal borders remain an exception - a measure of last resort - and are used only if necessary and proportionate, limiting the impact on free movement. The Commission proposes: to increase up to one year (instead of six months) the maximum time limit for temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat and to increase from up to 30 days to up to six months the limit for the length of prolongation periods; to introduce better procedural safeguards in order to ensure that the decision on temporary border control at internal borders or their prolongation is based on a proper risk assessment and is taken in cooperation with the other Member States concerned.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the secondary movements of irregular migrants and the increase of cross-border terrorist threats posing a serious threat to the internal security of a number of Schengen States, some Members States have been compelled to extend the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls. Based on the current Schengen rules, border controls at internal borders are possible for longer than six months when there are serious deficiencies in the external border management of a Member State, as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation. In situations where the serious threat to public policy or internal security is not related to deficiencies in the management of the external borders as demonstrated during a Schengen Evaluation, the reintroduction of border control at internal borders is subject to the conditions and time limits set out in the Schengen Borders Code. While the current rules for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls have proved sufficient in the vast majority of cases, the maximum periods laid down in the legislation may not be sufficient when Member States face serious and persistent threats to public order or internal security. This is why the Commission considers it necessary to adapt the maximum periods for the temporary reintroduction of border checks to current needs, while ensuring that the use of this measure remains exceptional and is decided only as a last resort. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to update the Schengen Borders Code to prolong the time limits for internal border controls. Stronger procedural safeguards are also being introduced to ensure that border controls at internal borders remain an exception - a measure of last resort - and are used only if necessary and proportionate, limiting the impact on free movement. The Commission proposes: to increase up to one year (instead of six months) the maximum time limit for temporary reintroduction of border control at internal borders for the foreseeable duration of the serious threat and to increase from up to 30 days to up to six months the limit for the length of prolongation periods; to introduce better procedural safeguards in order to ensure that the decision on temporary border control at internal borders or their prolongation is based on a proper risk assessment and is taken in cooperation with the other Member States concerned. Member States will prepare and submit a risk assessment assessing how long the identified threat is expected to persist and which sections of the internal borders are affected and how border control contributed to address the identified threat; to introduce a better follow up to the opinion of the Commission expressing concerns on the necessity or proportionality of border controls being exercised for longer than six months and the consultation procedure involving the Commission, Member States and, as now proposed, relevant Agencies; a new possibility is introduced to extend internal border controls by a maximum period of two years where the serious threat to internal security or public policy persists beyond the one-year deadline , provided that it can be attributed to the same grounds (e.g. threat related to the operation of a cross-border terrorist network) and that commensurate exceptional national measures are taken within the territory to address the threat (such as the state of emergency).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission recalls that the right of EU citizens and their families to move freely and reside in any EU country is one of the four fundamental freedoms enshrined in the EU Treaties. Free movement of persons would not be possible unless the social security rights of mobile Europeans and their family members were protected. In all, it is estimated that: 3.7 million of Europeans are economically inactive mobile citizens; nearly 80 000 mobile citizens are entitled to long-term care benefits, totalling EUR 793 million (0.4% of the total EU expenditure on long-term care benefits); some 27 300 persons within the EU export their unemployment benefit to another Member State; there are 91 700 unemployed cross-border workers per year, 53 500 of whom are frontier workers. This initiative is part of the European Commission's labour mobility package of 2016. Its objective is to continue the process of modernisation of the EU law on social security coordination set out in Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and No 987/2009, by further facilitating the exercise of citizens' rights while ensuring legal clarity, a fair and equitable distribution of the financial burden among the Member States and administrative simplicity and enforceability of the rules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission’s preferred options include the following: to amend the current equal treatment provisions with regard to the access of economically inactive citizens to social benefits; the establishment of a coherent regime for long-term care benefits; new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases (aggregation of periods of insurance; the export of unemployment benefits; paying unemployment benefits to frontier workers); the coordination of family benefits intended to replace income during child-raising periods. CONTENT: the proposal focuses on four areas of coordination where improvements are required: (i) economically inactive citizens' access to social benefits, (ii) long-term care benefits, (iii) unemployment benefits and (iv) family benefits. Each Member State is free to determine the features of its own social security system - which benefits are provided, the conditions for eligibility, how these benefits are calculated and what contributions should be paid, and for all social security branches (old age, unemployment and family benefits), provided that such national provisions respect the principles of EU law in particular concerning equal treatment and non-discrimination. Access to social benefits claimed by economically inactive EU mobile citizens: further to recent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the proposal specifies that access to social security benefits for economically inactive mobile citizens in the host Member State, may be made conditional upon that citizen holding a legal right of residence in that Member State in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The proposal clearly distinguishes an economically inactive citizen from a jobseeker whose right of residence is conferred directly by Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Long-term care benefits: the proposed revision aims to establish a coherent regime for the coordination of long-term care benefits (currently dealt with under the sickness chapter) by introducing a separate Chapter for their coordination in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, by including a definition and providing for a list of those benefits. Unemployment benefits: the proposal sets out new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases. The proposal: requires a minimum qualifying period of three months insurance in the Member State of most recent activity before a right to aggregate past periods of insurance arises (while requiring the Member State of previous activity to provide benefits when this condition is not fulfilled); extends the minimum period for an export of unemployment benefits from three to six months while providing for the possibility of exporting the benefit for the whole period of entitlement. The aim is to improve the opportunities for unemployed persons moving to another Member State to look for work and their chances for reintegration into the labour market and to address skills mismatches across borders; makes the Member State of most recent employment responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits when the frontier worker has worked there for at least 12 months and otherwise attributing the responsibility to the Member State of residence. Child benefits : the proposal aims to change the current coordination provisions so that child-raising allowances are considered individual and personal rights and to permit an optional right for the secondary competent Member State to pay the benefit in full. Posted workers : the proposal clarifies the rules on applicable legislation and the relationship between the Regulations on coordination and Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. It strengthens the administrative rules on social security coordination in the fields of information exchange and verification of the social security status of such workers in order to prevent potentially unfair practices or abuse. Technical amendments : the proposed amendments concern: (i) the prioritisation of derived rights to sickness benefits; (ii) the reimbursement of costs for medical examination; (iii) the calculation of the annual average costs in the field of sickness benefits; and (iv) the introduction of measures to facilitate identification of fraud or error in the application of the Regulations, including the introduction of a permissive ground for Member States to periodically exchange personal data. Furthermore, the procedures for recovery of unduly paid social security benefits have been revised to align them with the equivalent procedures in Directive 2010/24/EU concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cross-border labour mobility has notably increased in recent years. In 2017, 17 million European citizens lived or worked in a Member State other than that of their nationality. This figure almost doubled compared to a decade ago. Postings have increased by 68% from 2010 to 2.3 million in 2016. There are 1.4 million EU citizens commuting to work in another Member State. There are also over 2 million workers in the road transport sector who cross intra-EU borders on a daily basis to transport goods or passengers. The European Pillar of Social Rights – proclaimed jointly by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017 - sets out a number of key principles and rights to support fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems. Ensuring fair labour mobility in Europe is central to this objective. As outlined in their Joint Declaration on the legislative priorities for 2018-2019, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission are committed to taking action to reinforce the social dimension of the Union, by working on improving the coordination of social security systems, by protecting workers from health risks in the workplace, by ensuring fair treatment for all in the Union labour market through modernised rules on posting of workers, and by further improving cross-border enforcement of the Union law. In this context, the Commission proposes the creation of a ""European Labour Authority"" to ensure that EU rules on worker mobility are observed in a fair, simple and effective manner. This initiative will complement and facilitate the implementation of ongoing initiatives aimed at ensuring fair mobility, including through the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive and of the lex specialis on the posting of workers in international road transport operations and the modernisation of EU provisions on the coordination of social security systems. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: three policy options were considered for the proposed Authority, these being a support option, an operational option, and a supervisory option. The operational option to be performed through a new Authority that builds on existing EU level mobility bodies turned out to be the most effective way to meet the objectives of the initiative. CONTENT: the proposal for a regulation aims at setting up a European Labour Authority, in the form of a decentralised EU agency, to help individuals, businesses and national administrations to make the most of the opportunities offered by free movement and to ensure a level playing field for workers' mobility. The Authority has three objectives: 1. facilitate access for individuals and employers to information on their rights and obligations as well as to relevant services. The Authority will provide information on employment, learning, mobility, recruitment and training opportunities, as well as guidance on the rights and obligations of those who live, work or are engaged in cross-border activities in another EU Member State; 2. support operational cooperation between authorities to ensure cross-border compliance with the relevant Union law, including facilitating the organisation of joint inspections. For example, the Authority will help to improve the exchange of information, support capacity building in national administrations, and assist them in carrying out joint inspections. The objectives are to enhance mutual trust between the actors, to improve day-to-day cooperation and to prevent possible fraud and abuse; 3. propose mediation and facilitate the search for solutions in the event of disputes between national authorities and cross-border disruptions of the labour market such as restructuring of companies affecting several Member States. The new Authority will pool technical and operational tasks of existing EU bodies into a permanent structure with a view to achieving improved and more efficient output In this context, the Authority will take over the management of the EURES European Coordination Office and replace: (i) the Technical Committee on the Free Movement of Workers; (ii) the Committee of Experts on Posting of Workers; (iii) he Technical Commission, the Audit Board, and the Conciliation Board of the Administrative Commission for the Coordination of Social Security Systems; (iv) replace the European Platform on tackling undeclared work. The Authority will benefit all those subject to Union rules in the field of cross-border mobility of labour and the coordination of social security, specifically, workers, whether employed or not, or any other citizen of the Union or a third-country national legally residing in the Union and in a cross-border situation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the total budgetary cost for the EU of the Authority is estimated at EUR 50.9 million per year at cruising speed (which should be reached by 2023). As regards staff numbers, the Authority would need 69 establishment plan posts, 60 seconded national experts and 15 contract agents."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is a global leader in environmental protection and climate action. The Commission considers the shift towards a clean, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy to be a priority. The programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE), established by Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 for the period 2014 to 2020, is the latest in a series of Union programmes over 25 years which support the implementation of environmental and climate legislation and policy priorities. Through its catalytic role, the programme supports small scale actions intended to initiate, expand or promote sustainable production, distribution and consumption practices, as well as to protect natural heritage. The Commission considers that this approach should be continued in the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. An enhanced LIFE programme would play an important role in developing climate action and clean energy investments across Europe. It would also help the EU meet its climate objectives and commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the environment and climate action programme (LIFE). It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, as well as the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Programme objectives : the proposed programme aims to achieve the Union’s objectives as set out in international environmental, climate and clean energy legislation, policy, plans and commitments. Its overall objective is to contribute to the shift towards: a clean, circular, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, including a transition to clean energy; protecting and improving the quality of the environment; halting and reversing biodiversity loss, including in marine ecosystems, so as to contribute to sustainable development. In particular, the new LIFE programme shall: mobilise investment and support energy efficiency activities, particularly in European regions lagging behind in the shift towards clean energy; support projects promoting best practice in relation to nature protection and biodiversity, as well as ‘strategic nature protection projects’ for all Member States, including measures to protect the marine environment; contribute to the transition to a circular economy model through financial support targeting a variety of actors (businesses, public authorities and consumers), in particular by applying, developing, and replicating best technology, practices and solutions tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including through integrated approaches for the implementation of waste management and prevention plans; support the other aspects of the Union's environment policy, such as the protection and improvement of air and water quality in the EU, implementing the 2030 climate and energy policy framework and meeting the Union’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. Actions taken under the programme are expected to contribute 61 % of the overall financial envelope of the programme to climate objectives. The Commission proposes to simplify the programme management procedures and allow for a wider geographical access. Synergies would be developed with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, Horizon Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility and InvestEU. Proposed budget : EUR 5.45 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027. The indicative breakdown of this amount is as follows: Environment : EUR 3.5 billion of which: (i) EUR 2.15 billion for the Nature and Biodiversity sub-programme; (ii) EUR 1.35 billion for the Circular Economy and Quality of Life sub-programme; Climate action : EUR 1.95 billion of which: (i) EUR 950 million for the sub-programme Climate change mitigation and adaptation; (ii) EUR 1 billion for the sub-programme clean energy transition."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 on general food law (the GFL Regulation) established the principle of risk analysis as a general principle in EU food law. Risk assessment at EU level is carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), independently of the risk management function, which is entrusted to the EU institutions, and more particularly to the Commission. The GFL Fitness Check and recent public debates have shown that certain aspects of the current legislative framework need to be addressed. Citizens demand that the risk assessment process in the area of food law (and the decision-making based on it) be more transparent. Transparency and confidentiality rules currently vary depending on the sub-area of regulation concerned. Many stakeholders and citizens complain that the EFSA’s evaluations of authorisation applications are essentially based on studies, data and information generated (and paid for) by the applicant for authorisation. Risk communication was also found not to be effective enough. As announced in the Communication replying to the European Citizens’ Initiative “Ban glyphosate and protect people and the environment from toxic pesticides”, this proposal is a targeted revision of the GFL Regulation (and other measures adopted in that framework) in order to improve transparency in risk assessment, reliability, objectivity and independence of studies used by EFSA in its risk assessment, risk communication, and governance of EFSA. CONTENT: the proposal seeks to amend not only the GFL Regulation but also eight additional sectoral legislative acts relating to the food chain. The main objectives of the proposed amendments are: ensure greater transparency by ensuring that scientists and citizens have access to key safety related information being assessed by EFSA at an early stage in the risk assessment. All supporting data and information relating to applications for authorisation are to be made public by EFSA upon receipt, including additional information, with the exception of information for which confidentiality is duly justified; improve citizens’ confidence in the credibility of scientific studies by: i. establishing a Union register of commissioned studies on substances subject to a food law authorisation system, to be managed by EFSA; the register of commissioned studies will have a positive impact on the objectivity of the evidence submitted by industry since it will provide additional guarantee that applicants submit all studies they have performed on a substance whatever their results; ii. providing a pre-submission procedure, by which EFSA may provide advice to an applicant, such advice being made public; iii. providing that at the stage of submission of authorisation application, when all studies are made public according to the new provisions on transparency, a consultation of third parties will be launched with the aim to identify whether other relevant scientific data or studies are available; iv. providing for controls and audits by Commission inspectors in relation to studies; v. introducing the possibility for the Commission to request EFSA to commission studies in exceptional circumstances (e.g. controversies) for the purpose of verification. better involving Members States in EFSA’s governance structure and scientific panels without touching on its independence : the proposal aligns the composition of EFSA’s Management Board with the Common Approach on decentralised agencies by including representatives of all Member States. It will also increase the involvement of Member States in the nomination process of Panels’ members. The existing strict criteria on independence are maintained and specific provisions require Member States to set up specific measures ensuring that the experts have concrete means to act independently as required by the proposal. strengthen risk communication : the proposal ensures a develop a comprehensive and effective risk communication strategy, involving the Commission, Member States and the EFSA throughout the risk analysis process, combined with open dialogue amongst all interested parties. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Commission considers that by strengthening the EFSA’s governance and making risk assessment more sustainable, EFSA will continue to play a fundamental role in the Union food safety system and to contribute to the health and well-being of Union citizens and to an innovative and competitive Union agri-food industry. To address these issues, the Commission has come up with a wide ranging and ambitious proposal requiring a significant increase in the resources available to the EFSA to enable it to discharge its existing and proposed new responsibilities. Member States that provide the EFSA with expertise also need to receive more compensation. The impact on EFSA's expenditure is estimated at EUR 256.270 million for the period 2020-2024 (staff costs: EUR 56.276 million; operational expenditure: EUR 199.994 million)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Visa Code, which entered into force on 5 April 2010, is a core element of the common visa policy: it lays down harmonised procedures and conditions for processing visa applications and issuing visas. On the basis of an evaluation report on its implementation, the Commission adopted in April 2014 a proposal to recast the Visa Code with a view to improving travel to the EU through visa facilitation measures (thereby contributing to tourism and trade) and harmonising the implementation of common rules. However, the divergence between the positions of the European Parliament and the Council as well as the evolution of the migration situation and the increased threat to security observed in recent years have led the Commission to announce the withdrawal of its recast proposal. This proposal takes account of the outcome of the negotiations on the proposal to recast the Visa Code. While preserving security at the external borders and ensuring the smooth functioning of the Schengen area, the proposed amendments aim to facilitate the movement of bona fide travellers and to simplify the legal framework of the visa procedure. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is based on an impact assessment focusing on the three main issues: insufficient financial resources to support visa processing : the preferred option is a moderate increase of the common visa fee to EUR 80; repeated visa procedures for regular travellers : the preferred option is a ‘one-size-fits-all’ multiple entry visas cascade at EU level and the possibility of adapting the cascade to specific countries; insufficient levels of return of irregular migrants to some countries of origin : the preferred option is targeted negative incentives. Negative measures in the visa area are likely to be most effective in bringing change in third country governments towards cooperation with Member States on the readmission of irregular migrants, although they might need to be combined. CONTENT: this proposal amends Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code). It lays down the procedures and conditions for issuing visas for intended stays on the territory of Member States not exceeding 90 days in any 180-days period. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Practical modalities for lodging an application : the proposal extends to six months the maximum deadline for lodging an application to allow travellers to plan ahead and avoid peak seasons; due to their specific working conditions, seafarers may lodge their application nine months before the intended trip. Minimum deadline for lodging an application has been set to allow Member States time for proper assessment of applications and organisation of work. The proposal clarifies rules on who may lodge the application on behalf of the applicant and a reference is made to professional, cultural, sports or education association or institution as distinct from commercial intermediaries. Visa fee : the visa fee is increased from EUR 60 to EUR 80. The proposed increase of the fee will allow Member State to maintain adequate levels of consular staff to process visa applications. The visa fee for minors (6-12 years of age) will be increased by EUR 5 to EUR 40. Decision on the application : the general decision making time should be maximum 10 days. This delay may be extended to the maximum period for deciding on applications to 45 days in certain circumstances, when further review of the application is required. In case of visa refusal, procedures should ensure an effective judicial remedy. Multiple entry visas with longer validity : harmonised rules will apply to multiple entry visas to better prevent ‘visa shopping’ and to reduce costs and save time for Member States and frequent travellers. Such multiple entry visas will be issued to trusted regular travellers with a positive visa history for a gradually increasing period from 1 up to 5 years. Travellers' fulfilment of entry conditions will be thoroughly and repeatedly verified. Short-term visas at external borders : to facilitate short-term tourism, Member States will be allowed to issue single-entry visas directly at external land and sea borders under temporary, seasonal schemes subject to strict conditions. Detailed provisions establish safeguards to minimise the irregular migration and security risks. Such visas will be valid for a stay of a maximum of 7 days in the issuing Member State only. Cooperation on readmission : the general provisions on the limited number of supporting documents, the visa fee, fee waiver for holders of diplomatic passports, 10-day processing time and the issuing of multiple entry visas will not apply to nationals of third countries not cooperating on readmission on the basis of objective and relevant criteria. The Commission is regularly to assess third countries’ cooperation on readmission, taking account of a number of indicators. The Commission’s proposal for the reform of the Visa Information System legal framework (to be presented in spring 2018) will further enhance the security and efficiency of the visa procedure, in particular by taking account of technological developments."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Japan is the world’s third largest economy outside of the EU in terms of GDP, yet only EU's seventh largest trading partner. It has a population of over 127 million inhabitants with a very high purchasing power. It is a key market for European Union exporters, services providers and investors. On 29 November 2012, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Japan. The Free Trade Agreement with Japan was renamed the ""Economic Partnership Agreement"" (the EPA) at the time of the conclusion of an agreement in principle on 6 July 2017. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2012, the Commission has negotiated with Japan an ambitious and comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners. The texts of the EPA after the finalisation of the negotiations were published in December 2017. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Economic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Japan. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission notably secured the following: Joint committee: the EPA establishes a Joint committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the Agreement. It shall be comprised of representatives of the EU and of Japan who will meet once a year or in urgent cases at the request of either side. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EPA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It will lead to an estimated loss of duties of EUR 970 million at the entry into force of the Agreement. After the EPA is fully implemented (after 15 years from its entry into force) the yearly loss of duties is estimated to reach EUR 2.084 billion. This estimation is based on a projection of the evolution of trade for the next 15 years without any agreement. On the other hand, the EPA is not expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the EU and Japan have a history of extensive political, economic and sectoral cooperation, which has evolved with time. Building on shared fundamental values, the EU established a Strategic Partnership with Japan in 2001. On 29 November 2012, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the European Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to negotiate a framework agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Japan, of the other part. These negotiations began in April 2013 and were concluded in April 2018. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing and provisional application of the Strategic Partnership Agreement, the Agreement was signed. The High Representative and the Commission considered that the objectives set by the Council in its directives on the negotiation of the Agreement have been met and that the Agreement can be submitted for conclusion. The present joint proposal concerns the legal instrument concluding the Agreement. CONTENT: this draft Council Decision seeks to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Strategic Partnership Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and Japan, of the other part. This Agreement is the first-ever bilateral framework agreement between the EU and Japan. It will provide a legal foundation for improving bilateral cooperation and cooperation in international and regional organisations and fora. The Strategic Partnership Agreement and the Economic Partnership Agreement are part of one negotiating context and have a clear legal link. Together, they are expected to provide tangible benefits and opportunities to the people of the EU and Japan. The Strategic Partnership Agreement aims to strengthen political, economic and sectoral cooperation across a wide spectrum of policy fields, such as climate change, research and innovation, maritime affairs, education, culture, migration, counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime and cybercrime. A Joint Committee shall be established with the objective of coordinating the overall partnership which is built upon this Agreement."

Recalling that the EU and Japan have been strategic partners since 2003, Members welcomed the conclusion of the draft Strategic Partnership Agreement, which provides a binding legal framework, strengthens EU-Japan bilateral relations and cooperation in more than 40 areas, as well as to address global issues requiring global cooperation such as climate change, migration, cyber threats, public health, transnational crime, peacebuilding operations, crisis and disaster management and the fight against terrorism. Parliament welcomed the reference to a parliamentary dimension in the agreement, which aims to strengthen the partnership through dialogue and cooperation on political issues, foreign and security policy and other types of sectoral cooperation. Human rights and fundamental freedoms Members reaffirmed the shared commitment to respect for human rights, democracy, fundamental freedoms, good governance and the rule of law, and common values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. They called on the Union to enter into a dialogue with the Japanese government with a view to a moratorium on capital punishment and its possible abolition. They also highlighted the need for increased cooperation on women's rights. International and regional relations While welcoming the EU’s new strategy to improve connectivity with Asia, Parliament called for, inter alia: - the expansion of EU-Japan bilateral cooperation and multilateral cooperation with South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and China with a view to achieving and maintaining peace and stability in the region, peaceful coexistence on the Korean peninsula and the full, irreversible and verifiable denuclearisation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; - the development of synergies between Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy and EU initiatives, including the EU Investment Plan and the extended EU Trans-European Transport Networks, in order to promote global cooperation in connectivity; - the strengthening of educational and cultural dialogue, university mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy with a view to promoting mutual understanding and cultural diversity; - intensifying cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, for example by developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan. Sectoral cooperation Taking noted of the current low levels of people-to-people exchanges and of the linguistic barriers, Parliament suggested further investment to enhance citizen-to-citizen interaction, educational and cultural dialogue, academic mobility programmes under Erasmus+, and public diplomacy to promote mutual understanding and cultural diversity. It also called for: - Japan’s ratification of the Paris Climate Agreement in 2016, and intensified cooperation in the field of sustainable energy, e.g. in developing low-emission forms of transport; - the suspension of whaling for scientific purposes and the lifting of Japan's reservations to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES); - further exchange of good practices regarding illegal logging; - the exchange of information and cooperation to end cosmetics testing on animals in Japan. Members called for the swift ratification of the provisional agreement by the parliaments of the EU Member States and for its thorough implementation in all sectors."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values. The proposed new Horizon Europe programme builds on the success of the previous framework programme, Horizon 2020. Horizon 2020 has already attracted the world’s best research institutions and researchers, supported 340 000 researchers, and developed Europe’s skilled human capital. Scientific publications from Horizon 2020 are world class and have contributed to major scientific breakthroughs. Specifically, Horizon Europe shall strengthen the EU’s scientific and technological bases in order to help tackle the major global challenges of our time and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the same time, the programme shall boost the Union’s competitiveness and help deliver on the Union’s strategic priorities. According to the Commission, the new programme is expected to increase GDP on average by 0.08% to 0.19% over 25 years and directly generate an estimated gain of up to 100 000 jobs in R&I activities in the ‘investment phase’ (2021-2027). The economic activity generated by the Programme is expected to foster an indirect gain of up to 200 000 jobs over 2027-2036, of which 40% will be highly skilled. The proposal is in line with the headline target of investing 3% of the EU’s GDP on research and development. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Horizon Europe research and innovation framework programme for the period 2021-2027 and lays down the rules for participation and dissemination of results applicable to indirect actions carried out under the programme. The programme’s general objective is to deliver scientific, economic and societal impact from the Union’s investments in research and innovation in order to: (i) strengthen the scientific and technological bases of the Union and foster its competitiveness, including in its industry; (ii) to deliver on the Union strategic priorities; (iii) contribute to tackling global challenges, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ has a more ‘top down’ directed approach addressing Union and global policy and competitiveness challenges and opportunities. These are integrated into five clusters (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. Alongside the regular calls for proposals, a limited set of highly visible missions shall be introduced. These will be designed in the context of a strategic planning process. Missions, with ambitious but time-bound and achievable goals, should speak to the public and engage it where relevant. They will be co-designed with Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ shall essentially focus on scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation by establishing a European Innovation Council, support the enhancement of European ecosystems of innovation and continued support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The European Innovation Council shall offer a one-stop-shop to high-potential innovators. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology shall complement the European Innovation Council by promoting sustainable innovation ecosystems and developing entrepreneurial and innovation skills in priority areas through its knowledge and innovation communities. The three pillars shall be underpinned by activities to strengthening the European Research Area, specifically: sharing excellence to fully exploit the potential in less R&I performing countries. Cross-cutting elements : the Commission proposes to: significantly strengthen international cooperation by extending association agreements to include countries with excellent science, technology and innovation capacities; make the principle of open science the modus operandi of the new programme by requiring open access to publications and data which shall accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation; rationalise the current plethora of European partnerships so that they can continue in simplified forms that are open to all (such as academia, industry, Member States, and philanthropic foundations). These partnerships shall be designed on the basis of Union added value, transparency, openness, impact, leverage effect; enhance synergies with other EU programmes to promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results. Rules for participation and dissemination : these shall have the following new features: (i) continuation of the principle of a single set of rules for participation and dissemination through further improvements; (ii) maintenance of ‘Horizon 2020’ funding rates; (iii) simplification of the cost reimbursement scheme, in particular the actual costs scheme for personnel costs; (vi) increased emphasis on exploitation and dissemination of results, particularly in the Union; (vi) communication by beneficiaries of Union funds, including to the public and the media. For Horizon Europe, the award criteria shall be excellence; impact; and quality and efficiency of the implementation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the Framework Programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices. The indicative distribution of this amount shall be: EUR 25.80 billion for pillar I ‘Open Science’; EUR 52.70 billion for Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’; EUR 13.50 billion for pillar III ‘Open innovation’; EUR 2.10 billion for the part ‘Strengthening the European Research Area’."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while the proposal for a Regulation establishing the framework programme for research and innovation ‘Horizon Europe’ for the period 2021-2027 sets out the general and specific objectives of Horizon Europe, the structure and the broad lines of activities to be carried out, this proposal for a Decision aims to define the operational objectives and the activities which are specific to parts of Horizon Europe. The Horizon Europe proposal is in line with the Commission proposal on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The proposal is framed by the premise that research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values, and enabling solutions that address challenges in a more systemic way. CONTENT: the proposal for a Decision seeks to establish the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe - the framework programme for research and innovation. It lays down the operational objectives of the specific programme, the budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the rules for implementation of the specific programme and activities to be carried out under this programme. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ includes five thematic clusters that address the full spectrum of global challenges through top-down collaborative R&I activities: (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. A small number of missions with specific goals will be launched from within the pillar. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ which essentially consists of: (i) scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation through a new European Innovation Council; (ii) activities aiming at enhancing and developing the overall European innovation landscape, including support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). Strategic planning : the implementation of Horizon Europe shall be steered by an inclusive and transparent strategic planning process of the research and innovation activities the programme will fund. The strategic planning exercise shall lay out a multiannual strategy for the development of work programme content, though it will remain sufficiently flexible to respond rapidly to unexpected needs and crises. This proposal lays down specific provisions for the programming and implementation of the framework programme, in particular for: (1) Missions (under the global issues and industrial competitiveness pillar ): these missions shall be co-designed and decided as part of the Horizon Europe strategic planning process, which shall include collaboration between the relevant Commission services, Member States, the European Parliament and relevant stakeholders. The first few missions shall be introduced in the first strategic planning exercise. Based on the first two years' experience, the number and scale of missions may be increased in subsequent work programmes. Whilst the duration of the Union support to missions shall not be expected to exceed 10 years and shall be subject to regular review (through the work programme cycle), the timeframe for expected impact of missions may spread out beyond this timeframe. For co-designing the missions and steering their implementation, the Commission may set up mission boards whose members shall be appointed by the Commission, following an open call for expressions of interest. (2) The European Research Council (ERC) : the Commission shall establish a European Research Council (ERC) to implement the actions under Pillar I 'Open Science' which relate to the ERC. The ERC shall be composed of the independent Scientific Council and the dedicated implementation structure responsible for the administrative implementation and programme execution. The President shall be appointed by the Commission following a transparent recruitment process involving an independent dedicated search committee, for a term of office limited to four years, renewable once. (3) The European Innovation Council (EIC) : to implement the EIC, the Commission shall establish a high level board (the EIC Board) that shall advise, inter alia, on the overall strategy, objectives, activities, evaluation criteria and selection of experts. The EIC shall be the sole channel for the Union support to breakthrough market-creating innovation. It shall provide direct tailor-made support to innovators through two main funding instruments – the Pathfinder and the Accelerator – which shall both focus through a mainly bottom-up, high-risk approach on breakthrough innovation; on innovator needs and be pro-actively managed. (4) Work programmes : the programme shall be implemented by work programmes referred to in Article 110 of Financial Regulation. They shall be prepared following a strategic planning process. Work programmes shall set out, where applicable, the overall amount reserved for blending operations. (5) Committee procedure : for the implementation of Horizon Europe, the Commission shall be assisted by a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. It would meet in different configurations according to the matter to be discussed. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the framework programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households’ access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union’s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‘GOVSATCOM’. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union’s role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the digital single market strategy established a robust framework which must now be matched with an equally ambitious investment programme to increase the EU's international competitiveness, as well as to develop and strengthen Europe's strategic digital capacities. European Heads of State and Government identified the main pillars of a strong digital economy: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, a world class infrastructure that includes high performance computing, digital skills, and the digital transformation of the public sector. In its resolution of 1 June 2017 on the digitising European industry, the European Parliament highlighted the importance of a common European cybersecurity approach, recognising the need to raise awareness and considered cyber-resilience as a crucial responsibility for business leaders and national and European industrial security policymakers. The digital Europe programme is a central element of the Commission's comprehensive response to the challenge of digital transformation, part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal for 2021-2027. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the digital Europe programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021 - 2027, the forms of European Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The overall objective of the proposed programme is to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and bring its benefits to European citizens and businesses. It shall reinforce Europe's capacities in key digital technology areas through large-scale deployment and widen their diffusion and uptake in areas of public interest and the private sector. The programme has five specific objectives: 1. high-performance computing : funding aims to build-up and strengthen the EU's high performance computing (HPC) and data processing capacities, and ensure their wide use both in areas of public interest such as health, environment and security, and by industry, notably SMEs. At EU level, in March 2017, 29 countries engaged to cooperate on connected mobility, and 16 Member States have committed so far to work together and with the Commission to acquire and deploy an integrated world-class high performance computing infrastructure. In January 2018, the Commission proposed a Council Regulation to establish the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking ‘EuroHPC’. The continuation of the Joint Undertaking is deemed to be the most effective instrument to implement the objectives of the EuroHPC initiative, in particular to coordinate national and European Union strategies and investments in high performance computing infrastructure and R&D; 2. cybersecurity : the programme shall contribute to the protection of the EU digital economy, society and democracies by promoting the EU cyber defence and cyber security industry, financing advanced cyber security equipment and infrastructure, and supporting the development of the necessary skills and knowledge. 3. artificial intelligence : the aim is to build-up and reinforce core artificial intelligence (AI) capacities such as a data resources and libraries of artificial intelligence algorithms and make them accessible to all businesses and public administrations, as well as reinforce and foster links between existing artificial intelligence testing and experimentation facilities in Member States; 4. advanced digital skills : the programme shall ensure that the current and future labour force can easily acquire advanced digital skills, notably in high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, by offering students, graduates, and existing workers the means to acquire and develop these skills, no matter where they are situated; 5. deployment, better use of digital capacities and interoperability : the objective is to expand the best use of digital capacities, notably high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, across the economy, in areas of public interest and society, including the deployment of interoperable solutions in areas of public interest and facilitate access to technology and knowhow for all businesses, notably SMEs. Digital innovation hubs : the proposal foresees a central role for digital innovation hubs in the implementation of the programme. A network of digital innovation hubs shall ensure the widest geographical coverage across Europe. The digital innovation hubs shall serve as access points to the latest digital capacities, including high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, as well as other innovative technologies such as key enabling technologies, also available also in fablabs or citylabs. They shall act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and promote open innovation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the programme is set at EUR 9.2 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, its indicative distribution shall be as follows: high performance computing: up to EUR 2.7 billion; cybersecurity: up to EUR 2.5 billion; artificial intelligence: up to EUR 2 billion; advanced digital skills: up to EUR 700 million; digital capacity utilisation and interoperability: up to EUR 1.3 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to respond to increased migratory and security challenges, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a new integrated border management fund under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. This new fund aims to provide enhanced support to Member States with a view to securing the Union’s common external borders. Within this framework, it is proposed that the integrated border management fund shall consist of two instruments: a financial support instrument in the field of border and visa management and a financial support instrument for customs control equipment. This proposal only concerns customs control equipment. The Commission shall at the same time present a separate proposal on the instrument in the field of border management and visas. The 2 140 customs offices that are present over the external borders of the European Union need to be properly equipped to ensure the operation of the customs union. In order to avoid the diversion of flows of goods towards the weakest points, it is essential to ensure equivalence in the performance of customs controls throughout the Customs Union. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to create the financial support instrument for customs control equipment as part of integrated border management fund. It lays down the objectives of the Instrument, the budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Objective : the proposed instrument aims to ensure greater uniformity in the performance of customs controls at the external borders by addressing the current imbalances between Member States due to geographical differences and disparities in capacity and available resources. It shall complement the actions foreseen under the Customs programme. The specific objective of this instrument is to contribute to adequate and equivalent customs control through the purchase, maintenance and upgrade of customs control equipment. The instrument shall be implemented in direct management, by means of grants. The Commission shall set up a coordination mechanism ensuring efficiency and interoperability between all the equipment purchased with the support of Union programmes and instruments. Eligible equipment : equipment shall be eligible only if it relates to at least one of the six following purposes: (i) non-intrusive inspection; (ii) indication of hidden objects on humans; (iii) radiation detection and nuclide identification; (iv) analysis of samples in laboratories; (v) sampling and field analysis of samples; (vi) handheld search. Annex 1 lays down an indicative list of customs control equipment that may be used to achieve the customs control purposes. The Commission may amend this list by means of delegated acts. In addition to the purchase, maintenance and upgrade of eligible equipment, and where appropriate, the instrument will also support the purchase or upgrade of customs control equipment for testing new pieces or new functionalities in operational conditions. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multi-annual framework includes a proposal of EUR 9.31 billion (in current prices) for the integrated border management fund for the period 2021-2027. Within this global envelope, the financial resources available for the implementation of this specific Regulation amount to EUR 1.3 billion (in current prices)."

Tasks and powers of the members of the team: as a general rule, the teams shall have the authority to perform the tasks and exercise the executive powers required for border control and return operations. They shall respect the laws and regulations of Albania. Members of the team shall wear their own uniform, visible personal identification and a blue armband with the insignias of the European Union and of the Agency on their uniforms. Members of the team may use force, including service weapons, ammunition and equipment, with the consent of their own State and of the Albania authorities, in the presence of Albanian border guards or other relevant staff, and in accordance with the Albanian law. Albanian authorities may authorise members of the team to use force also in the absence of their border guards. Accreditation document: the Agency shall, in cooperation with Albania, issue an accreditation document to members of the team for the purposes of identification vis-à-vis the Albanian authorities as proof of the holder’s rights to perform the tasks and exercise the powers conferred under this Agreement and in the Operational Plan. Fundamental rights: in the performance of their tasks and in the exercise of their powers, Members of the team shall fully respect fundamental rights and freedoms, including as regards access to asylum procedures, human dignity and the prohibition of torture, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to liberty, the principle of non-refoulement and the prohibition of collective expulsions, the rights of the child and the right to respect for private and family life.

Processing of personal data: personal data shall be processed by members of the team when necessary in accordance with the rules applicable to the Agency and the EU Member States. Processing of personal data by the Albanian authorities shall be subject to Albanian laws. The Agency, the participating Member States and the Albanian authorities shall draw up a common report on the processing of personal data by members of the team at the end of each action. This report shall be sent to the Agency's Fundamental Rights Officer and Data Protection Officer. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: although the status agreement in itself does not entail financial implications, it is the actual deployment of border guards' teams on the basis of an operational plan and relevant grant agreement that will entail costs borne by the budget of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Future operations under the status agreement will be financed through the European Border and Coast Guard Agency’s own resources. The financial statement annexed to the proposal for a Regulation on a European Border and Coast Guard on the expenditure of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency evaluated at EUR 6.090 million on average each year for 2017-2020 the reinforced cooperation with third countries (including possible joint operations with neighbouring countries)."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament shall decide in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the use of hired vehicles can reduce the costs of undertakings carrying goods on their own account or for hire and reward and at the same time increase their operational flexibility. Directive 2006/1/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council provides for a minimum level of the market opening for the use of vehicles hired without drivers for the carriage of goods by road. However, this Directive: allows Member States to restrict the use of hired goods vehicles with a gross vehicle weight above six tonnes for own account operations; restricts the use of a vehicle which has been hired in a Member State different from the one where the undertaking hiring the vehicle is established. The Commission therefore proposes to remove these restrictions and establish a uniform regulatory framework across the EU to ensure equal access for transport operators across the EU to the market for hired vehicles. The proposal is part of a series of proposals in the field of road transport which the Commission intends to adopt in 2017. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option aims to: (i) allow the use of hired goods vehicles for own account operations throughout the EU; (ii) allow the use of goods vehicles which an operator established in one Member State has hired in another Member State for a certain period of time. Expected benefits include: a reduction in operating costs of EU hauliers by a total of EUR 158 million in 2030; a total annual economic benefit of around EUR 240 million in 2030 for the vehicle rental/leasing sector; the creation of almost 5 000 additional jobs (2 900 in the vehicle rental/leasing sector and 1 700 in the road haulage business). CONTENT: the proposal amending Directive 2006/1/EC seeks to: allow the use within its territory of vehicles hired by undertakings established on the territory of another Member State provided that the vehicle is registered or put into circulation in compliance with the laws of a Member State; allow the use of a vehicle hired in another Member State is to be allowed for at least four months in any given calendar year to enable undertakings to meet temporary or seasonal demand peaks and/or to replace defective or damaged vehicles. By 5 years after the deadline for transposition of the Directive, the Commission shall submit a report on the implementation and effects of this Directive. The report shall include information on the use of vehicles hired in a Member State other than the Member State of establishment of the undertaking hiring the vehicle. On the basis of this report, the Commission shall assess whether it is necessary to propose additional measures."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the customs 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing customs cooperation. Many of the activities in the customs area are of a cross-border nature, involving and affecting all Member States, and therefore they cannot be effectively and efficiently delivered by individual Member States. Since 2016, the Union Customs Code is the new legal customs framework. The Code triggered a massive digitalisation project with 17 different electronic systems to be fully in place by 2020. Some systems will be deployed gradually up to 2025. These electronic systems touch upon all customs procedures. The upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU implies disentangling the United Kingdom as a Member State from all existing customs electronic systems financed by customs 2020. These implications and costs however cannot be precisely estimated at this stage. The implementation of all these aspects can only be achieved through intense operational cooperation between customs administrations of the Member States, between them and other authorities, with trade and other third parties. It is therefore necessary to ensure the continuity of the Union’s financing of customs cooperation activities by establishing a new cooperation programme in this area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the customs 2020 programme. Objective : the general objective of the proposed new programme is to support the customs union and customs authorities to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, to ensure security and safety within the Union and to protect the Union from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity. Customs cooperation and capacity building shall focus, on the one hand, on human networking and competency building actions and, on the other hand, IT capacity building actions. Like the current Customs 2020 programme, the new programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. It may provide funding in any form provided for in the Financial Regulation, in particular grants, procurements and reimbursement of expenses. Eligible actions : the programme shall cover expenses for preparation, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation and other activities for managing the programme and evaluating the achievement of its objectives. It shall also cover expenses relating to studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions, in so far as they are related to the objectives of the programme, as well as expenses linked to information technology networks focusing on information processing and exchange, including corporate information technology tools and other technical and administrative assistance needed in connection with the management of the programme. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of the European electronic systems ‘common components’ and ‘national components’ reflecting better the reality of electronic systems and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand and the Member States on the other hand have been listed. Lastly, a multi-annual strategic plan for customs, to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 950 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and Morocco, of the other part entered into force on 1 March 2000. Liberalisation measures on agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products were introduced into the Association Agreement by an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco (the Liberalisation Agreement), which entered into force in 2012. Since the Association Agreement entered into force, the Union has continued to strengthen its bilateral relations with Morocco and awarded it advanced status in 2008 which enshrines the strength of the bilateral links between the parties and their shared ambitions and commitments with a view to the advancement of their joint initiatives, such as good governance and political and socio-economic reforms. At the same time, the Union has consistently reaffirmed its commitment to resolving the dispute in Western Sahara. Although it has not recognised Morocco’s sovereignty over Western Sahara, it fully supports the efforts made by the United Nations Secretary-General and his personal envoy to help the parties reach a fair, lasting and mutually-acceptable political solution that would ensure the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara under agreements aligned with the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, as set out in the Resolutions of the UN Security Council, in particular Resolutions 2152 (2014) and 2218 (2015). In its judgment of 21 December 2016 in Case C-104/16 P3, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the Association Agreement and the Liberalisation Agreement between the Union and Morocco did not apply to Western Sahara. Following the Court judgment, the practice of applying the trade preferences set out in the Association Agreement and its protocols on a de facto basis to products originating in Western Sahara, a non-self-governing territory, could not continue, unless Protocol 1 (access to the EU market for Moroccan agricultural products, processed agricultural products, fish and fishery products) and Protocol 4 (concerning rules of origin) were amended to establish that products originating in Western Sahara should be treated in the same way as those from Morocco. On 29 May 2017, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Morocco with a view to establishing a legal basis to grant the tariff preferences laid down in the Association Agreement to products originating in Western Sahara. An agreement between the EU and Morocco is the only means of ensuring that the import of products originating in Western Sahara benefits from preferential origin, given that only the Moroccan authorities are able to ensure compliance with the rules necessary for the granting of such preferences. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the amendment of Protocols 1 and 4 to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement establishing an association between the European Communities and their Member States, of the one part, and the Kingdom of Morocco, of the other part. This proposal applies amendments to Protocol 4 and Protocol 1 of the EU-Morocco Association Agreement with a view to respecting the obligations of the Court judgment of 21 December 2016 and providing a legal basis for granting preferences to products from Western Sahara. The aim of the proposal is to: These measures will prevent Western Sahara suffering a competitive disadvantage and missing out on investment opportunities compared with neighbouring countries, which benefit from tariff preferences on different grounds (association agreements or the Generalised System of Preferences). Lastly, it should be emphasised that the judgment delivered by the Court of Justice on 27 February 2018 in Case C-266/16 relates to the partnership agreement between the EU and Morocco in the fishing industry. This is a separate issue from the matter of market access, which is covered by the Association Agreement and therefore this proposal. Any agreement is understood to be purely provisional, pending the resolution of the dispute through the UN and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. On this point, the Agreement states that it is concluded without prejudice to the respective positions of the European Union and Morocco with regard to the status of Western Sahara."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the WTO panel report adopted on 19 April 2017 in the WTO dispute settlement proceedings DS492 - measures affecting tariff concessions on certain poultry meat products brought by China against the European Union, the EU needed to comply with the findings. In particular, the panel found that when allocating quantities within tariff rate quotas to supplying countries under WTO rules, the EU should have taken into account as a ‘special factor’ China's increased ability to export poultry products to the EU following the relaxation of sanitary measures in July 2008. The reasonable period of time for the implementation of the Panel Report under the WTO rules began on 19 April 2017. On 12 March 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on a mutually agreed solution with China. Those negotiations were concluded and an agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and China was initialled on 18 June 2018. The agreement was signed on behalf of the Union subject to its conclusion at a later date. It is now necessary to approve the Agreement on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to conclude the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and China in relation to DS492 European Union - measures affecting tariff concessions on certain poultry meat products. The Agreement seeks to open the following tariff rate quotas (TRQ): The Commission shall adopt implementing Regulations to expand and manage the relevant quotas. These implementation measures are being prepared in parallel with this proposal. Once the quotas are opened, the EU and China shall notify the Agreement to the WTO Dispute Settlement Body as a mutually agreed solution in relation to the dispute DS492. The Commission also needs to provide for transparent and appropriate tariff quota management. Lastly, the Agreement shall also respect rights of other suppliers, which were agreed in the context of past Article XXVIII GATT negotiations."

BACKGROUND: the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) - initially established for the programming period 2007-2013 - is a concrete expression of EU solidarity with European workers who lost their jobs. It was set up to provide support to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns caused by globalisation and whose redundancies have a significant adverse impact on the regional or local economy. Union involvement through the EGF complements national measures in order to re-integrate dismissed workers by offering them a unique combination of tailored measures that lead to more sustainable results, increase the self-esteem of beneficiaries, who finally have a more proactive approach to job seeking, and improve their employability. Experience achieved so far with the EGF indicates that the help offered would not have been available without the involvement of the EGF. For the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, the scope of the EGF has been extended by Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which has to be revised by the end of 2020. The prime objective of this proposal is to ensure that the EGF continues to operate beyond 31 December 2020, to enlarge its objective offer and to amend some technical details in order to have more coherence and synergies, flexibility, focus on performance, and simplification. IMPACT ANALYSIS: the most important finding regarding the EGF is that as an emergency assistance fund, the EGF should remain outside the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). It lays down the objectives of the EGF, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding, including applications by the Member States for financial contributions from the EGF for measures targeting the eligible beneficiaries. Mission and objectives of the EGF : it is proposed to explicitly include in the mission the role played by the EGF in contributing to the implementation of the principles defined under the European Pillar of Social Rights. In addition, the specific objective of the EGF is to offer assistance in case of unexpected major restructuring events, particularly those caused by globalisation-related challenges, such as: changes in world trade patterns; trade disputes; financial or economic crises; the transition to low-carbon economy; or as a consequence of digitisation or automation. Particular emphasis shall lie on measures that help the most disadvantaged groups. Intervention criteria : the Commission proposes to lower the threshold of displaced workers for a case to be eligible, from 500 to 250 within a reference period of four months (or 6 months in sectoral cases). This is because there is a general trend of fewer very large scale redundancies and because the dismissal of 250 workers usually has a significant impact in most regions. This is also to acknowledge the fact that in many Member States, most workers are employed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). A new provision has been added allowing Member States to apply for EGF assistance if redundancies occur in the same region but in different economic sectors. Eligible measures : as a change to the current Regulation, the inclusion of the dissemination of skills required in the digital age shall be a mandatory horizontal element of any coordinated package of personalised services offered. The proposed measures shall be based on the personal needs and qualifications of the beneficiary. Technical assistance from the Commission : this assistance shall support any measures necessary to implement the proposed Regulation. This amount could reach up to 0.5 % of the annual maximum amount of the EGF. This is higher than in the current programming period. This shall also include additional measures to increase networking and the exchange of good practice between Member States. Amount of financial contribution : the Fund's co-financing rate which currently stands at 60%, will be aligned with the highest ESF+ co-financing rates for a given Member State. In several cases this would mean that the EU co-finances a higher share of the total cost. Eligibility period : the standard period for the implementation of EGF measures shall remain at 24 months. However, the proposal stipulates that the 24-month period shall be counted from the time the decision to mobilise the EGF is adopted and not from the date of application for EGF support. Funding allocated to the EGF : the EGF is not included in the budgetary ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. The maximum amount that can be used by the EGF for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 1.57 billion (in current prices), or an average of EUR 225 million per year."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: tackling unemployment and persistently high rates of poverty remains a priority throughout the EU. Social and employment issues are a primary concern of European citizens. Targeted support measures are needed to address the challenges identified in the European Semester and in the European Pillar of Social Rights proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission: shortfalls in skill levels, under-performance in active labour market policy, problems arising from new technologies such as automation and new forms of work, social exclusion and low labour mobility. In this context, this Commission proposes to make the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) the EU’s main instrument to invest in people by merging the following funds and programmes: the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI); the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD); the Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) programme; the Programme for the Union’s action in the field of health (the Health Programme).

The ESF+ shall support policies and priorities which aim to help create full employment, enhance quality and productivity at work, increase the geographical and occupational mobility of workers within the Union, improve education and training systems, and promote social inclusion and health. The overarching policy objective of the ESF+ Regulation shall be to help create a more performing and resilient ‘Social Europe’ and implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, as well as the social and employment priorities endorsed by the European economic governance process. Actions under the shared management strand of the ESF+ shall also contribute to achieving the strategic objectives set out in the proposed Common Provisions Regulation (CPR) in particular: · a smarter Europe through the development of skills for smart specialisation, skills for key enabling technologies, industrial transition; · a greener, low carbon Europe through the improvement of education and training systems necessary for the adaptation of skills and qualifications, the creation of new jobs in sectors related to the environment, climate and energy, and the bioeconomy. Shared management strand : under the proposal, Member States shall: allocate an appropriate amount of their ESF+ resources under shared management to address challenges identified in relevant country-specific recommendations; allocate at least 25% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to the specific objectives for the social inclusion policy area, including the promotion of the socio-economic integration of third country nationals; allocate at least 2% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to the specific objective of addressing material deprivation. The European Fund for the most deprived (FEAD) shall continue to benefit from simpler rules, to ensure that the Fund is accessible to an even wider range of beneficiaries, such as small non-governmental organisations. Member States with a rate of young people aged 15-29 not in employment, education or training (NEET) above a certain threshold shall devote 10% of their ESF+ resources under shared management to targeted actions and structural reforms to support young people. In the case of the outermost regions with a NEET rate above this threshold, this percentage shall be increased to 15%. The proposal defines the rules on eligibility and control, in addition to the future CPR for all ESF+ support under shared management (with the exception of support to combat material deprivation). There is also a provision on ‘innovative actions’, which encourages Member States to support social innovation and social experimentation, which strengthen bottom-up approaches based on partnerships. Direct and indirect management strand : Under the employment and social innovation strand, ESF+ support shall allow innovative solutions to be tested and evaluated before they are applied on a larger scale to help improve policies, for example by supporting worker mobility in Europe. Under the health strand, support shall focus on priority areas where cooperation at European level has a proven advantage: disease prevention, crisis preparedness for cross-border health threats, assistance to Member States' health authorities, digitisation of health and care systems, support for EU health legislation and strengthening cross-border cooperation, for example on rare diseases. Proposed budget : the Commission proposes to allocate a total budget of EUR 101 billion (in current prices) to ESF+ for the period 2021-2027 , of which EUR 100 billion for the shared management strand of ESF+. The financial envelope for the direct management strands of the ESF+ would amount to EUR 1 174 million in current prices, of which EUR 761 million for employment and social innovation and EUR 413 million for health."

BACKGROUND: in order to simplify the legislative structure and ensure clarity of the applicable provisions in the field of cohesion, the common provisions regulation (CPR) lays down common rules and specific rules for the Funds. So goes for the Regulation covering both the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund intervening under ‘Investment for jobs and growth’ and, for the ERDF, under the ‘European territorial cooperation’ goal (Interreg). As part of a major simplification effort, the Commission now proposes to adopt specific provisions in relation to the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) where one or more Member States cooperate across borders with regard to effective programming. The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) actively promotes territorial cooperation. The 13 ENPI (European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument) CBC programmes implemented during the 2007-2013 period covered nine EU land borders, three sea basins and one sea crossing. The programmes involved 34 countries, 19 EU Member States and 12 of the 16 neighbourhood partner countries plus Norway, Russia and Turkey CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down rules for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) with a view to fostering cooperation between Member States inside the Union and between Member States and adjacent third countries, partner countries, other territories or overseas countries and territories (OCTs) respectively. · With regard to support from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA III), the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI) and the funding for all the OCTs for the period 2021 to 2027, the proposal defines additional specific objectives as well as the integration of those funds into Interreg programmes, the criteria for third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible and certain specific implementation rules. · With regard to support from the ERDF and the external financing instruments of the Union (the Interreg funds) to Interreg programmes, this proposed Regulation defines the Interreg-specific objectives as well as the organisation, the criteria for Member States, third countries, partner countries and OCTs and their regions to be eligible, the financial resources, and the criteria for their allocation. European territorial cooperation (Interreg) objective strands : support shall be provided by the ERDF and, where appropriate, by the Union's external financing instruments for the following five components: (i) cross-border; (ii) transnational and maritime; (iii) outermost regions; (iv) interregional cooperation and; (v) the new interregional innovation investments. Geographical coverage : the cross-border cooperation component shall focus on NUTS level 3 regions of the Union along all internal and external land borders with third countries or partner countries, while cross-border cooperation along maritime borders shall be integrated into the broader ‘transnational and maritime cooperation’ component. The Commission stresses that access to public services such as hospitals and universities is generally more difficult in border regions. Moreover, navigating between different administrative and legal systems is still often complex and costly. The proposal therefore aims to help cross-border cooperation programmes to focus on institutional cooperation, solving border problems and investment in common services of public interest. Transnational cooperation shall cover larger territories on the mainland of the Union, whereas maritime cooperation shall cover territories around sea-basins and integrate cross-border cooperation on maritime borders during the programming period 2014-2020. A specific outermost regions’ component shall be established in order to enable outermost regions to cooperate with their neighbouring countries and territories in the most effective and simple way. The list of Interreg programmes to receive financial support shall be set out in an implementing act adopted by the European Commission. Specific objectives : taking into account the special features of Interreg, two Interreg-specific objectives are set out: (i) 'better Interreg governance'; and (ii) 'a safer and more secure Europe', The proposed Regulation also sets out specific percentages for thematic concentration. Programming, monitoring, eligibility : the proposal: (i) clarifies the rules governing funds for small projects that offer real added value and play an important role in building trust between citizens and institutions; (ii) ensures consistent monitoring of performance by refining the common set of performance indicators; (iii) establishes a clear hierarchy between the EU eligibility rules, the specific rules for Interreg programmes and, finally, the national eligibility rules. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: this proposal has no budgetary implications. The ERDF resources for the European territorial cooperation goal (Interreg) shall amount to EUR 8.43 billion of the global resources available for budgetary commitment from the ERDF, ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund for the 2021-2027 programming period. The resources shall be allocated as follows: 52.7% (EUR 4.44 billion in total) for cross-border cooperation (component 1); 31.4% (EUR 2.65 billion in total) for transnational cooperation and maritime cooperation (component 2); 3.2% (EUR 270.1 million in total) for outermost regions’ cooperation (component 3); 1.2% (EUR 100 million in total) for interregional cooperation (component 4); 11.5 % (a total of EUR 970 million) for interregional innovation investments (component 5)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: with 1.8% of EU GDP, down from 2.2% in 2009, infrastructure investment activities in the Union in 2016 were about 20% below investment rates before the global financial crisis. While investment conditions in Europe have improved thanks to structural reforms by Member States, a more favourable economic situation and public interventions, notably under the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), investment gaps remain considerable in Europe. In order to meet the ambitious policy objectives of the Union, attracting private capital to finance investment remains essential while adjusting the approach towards more policy relevance. Building on lessons learnt from evaluations of predecessor financial instruments and of the EFSI, the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to consolidate all EU budget financing in the form of loans and guarantees into a single framework. All evaluations found that the EU Guarantee proved relevant and enabled the EIB to undertake riskier activities and introduce higher risk products to support a wider range of beneficiaries. The EFSI also proved a relevant tool to mobilise private capital. The EFSI has mobilised EUR 207 billion of investment by end-2017. Mobilised investment from approved operations are expected to reach the EUR 315 billion target by mid-2018 or shortly thereafter. The new InvestEU programme shall have the capacity to shape an EU strategy to address the persistent investment gaps in the Union in sectors such as in new mobility models, renewable energies, energy efficiency, research and innovation, digitisation, education and skills, social economy and infrastructure, circular economy, natural capital, climate action or small and medium-sized businesses creation and growth. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the InvestEU Fund which shall support the policy objectives of the Union by mobilising public and private investment within the EU, hereby addressing market failures and investment gaps that hamper the achievement of EU goals regarding sustainability, competitiveness and inclusive growth. With the InvestEU programme, a single EU investment support instrument for internal action shall be created for the 2021-2027 MFF. InvestEU Fund : this fund consists of an EU budget guarantee that will back the financial products provided by the implementing partners. The Commission proposes to allocate EUR 15.2 billion to the InvestEU Fund. The EU budget could thus provide a guarantee of EUR 38 billion to support projects of strategic importance across the EU. The financing and investment operations to be supported by the EU guarantee under the InvestEU Fund shall contribute to: the competitiveness of the Union, including innovation and digitisation; the sustainability of the Union economy and its growth; social resilience and inclusion; the integration of Union capital markets and the strengthening of the Single Market, including solutions addressing the fragmentation of the Union capital markets, diversifying sources of financing for Union enterprises and promoting sustainable finance. The InvestEU Fund has four policy windows: (i) sustainable infrastructure; (ii) research, innovation and digitisation; (iii) SMEs; (iv) social investment and skills. It is also foreseen that third countries could be associated to financial products under the policy windows of the InvestEU Fund by providing their full participation in cash. Member States wishing to use part of their funds under shared management through the InvestEU Fund may also contribute. These amounts come in addition to the EU guarantee of EUR 38 billion (in current prices). The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group should remain a privileged implementing partner under the InvestEU Fund's EU compartment. In addition, banks and other national and regional development institutions in Member States with specific experience and expertise may become financial partners, under certain conditions. Governance : the InvestEU Fund shall have an advisory board, which shall meet in two configurations: (i) representatives of implementing partners; and (ii) representatives of Member States. In particular, it shall advise the Commission on the design of financial products to be implemented under the InvestEU Fund, market failures and sub-optimal situations. It shall inform Member States about the implementation of the InvestEU Fund and allow regular exchanges of views on market developments and sharing of best practices. The proposal also introduces: the InvestEU advisory hub , which shall provide in particular technical assistance for project development; the InvestEU portal , which shall provide an easily accessible database to promote projects seeking funding. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the budgetary framework (commitments in current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU Programme is EUR 14.725 billion, including EUR 525 million for the InvestEU advisory platform, the InvestEU portal and accompanying measures. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 15.2 billion, of which EUR 1 billion being covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: there are around 24 million companies in the EU, out of which approximately 80% are limited liability companies. Around 98-99% of limited liability companies are SMEs. The freedom of establishment plays a crucial role in the development of the Single Market as it allows corporate entities to pursue economic activities in other Member States on a stable basis. However, in practice the exercise of the freedom of establishment by companies remains difficult, in particular because company law is not sufficiently adapted to cross-border mobility in the EU. The Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) has considered that the freedom of establishment enshrined in Article 49 TFEU entails the right, for companies established in a Member State, to transfer their seat to another Member State through a cross-border conversion without losing their legal personality. In particular in its recent judgement Polbud, the ECJ confirmed the right of companies to carry out cross-border conversions on the basis of the freedom of establishment. Currently, companies wishing to move their registered offices cross-border need to rely on Member States' laws. Such laws, where they exist, are often incompatible or difficult to combine with each other. Moreover, more than half of the Member States do not provide any specific rules allowing for cross-border conversions. SMEs are in particular negatively impacted since often they lack resources to perform cross-border procedures through costly and complicated alternative methods. This also means that the protection of stakeholders such as employees, creditors or minority shareholders is often ineffective or insufficient due to the lack of, overlapping or contradictory rules. Therefore, the Commission considers that the EU legislator needs to step in and provide for rules on cross-border conversion with adequate and proportionate safeguards for employees, creditors and shareholders to create a dynamic and fair Single Market. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the chosen options consist in introducing: harmonised EU procedures to enable companies to carry-out direct cross-border conversions and divisions; harmonised rules throughout the single market to protect minority shareholders and creditors with the possibility for Member States to provide additional safeguards; targeted amendments to provide workers with the necessary protection, information, consultation and participation; rules and procedures whereby Member States would assess on a case-by-case basis whether the cross-border conversion constitutes an artificial arrangement designed to obtain undue tax advantages or to undermine the rights of employees, minority shareholders or creditors. According to the Commission, the new common rules on cross-border conversions and divisions would result in savings of between EUR 12 000 and EUR 37 000 (for divisions) and between EUR 12 000 and 19 000 (for conversions) depending on the size of the companies and Member States concerned. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Directive (EU) 2017/1132 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border mergers of limited liability companies introduces a new European legal framework for cross-border divisions of companies and firms. The objective of this proposal is two-fold: provide specific and comprehensive procedures for cross-border conversions, divisions and mergers to foster cross-border mobility in the EU while, at the same time, offering company stakeholders adequate protection in order to safeguard the fairness of the Single Market. (1) Cross-border conversions : the proposal should allow companies to carry out a cross-border conversion by converting the legal form they have in one Member State into a similar legal form in another Member State. This process should ensure: (i) that companies retain their legal personality throughout the procedure, without being obliged to dissolve or wind up in the departure Member State, and (ii) that they constitute a new entity in the Member State of destination. A crucial element of the procedure is that it would prevent a cross-border conversion where it is determined that it constitutes an abuse, namely in cases where it constitutes an artificial arrangement aimed at obtaining undue tax advantages or at unduly prejudicing the legal or contractual rights of employees, creditors or minority members. The first step in the procedure would be the preparation of the draft terms of the cross-border conversion and two targeted reports addressed to shareholders and employees on the implications that the cross-border conversion will have. Thereafter, the company is to take a decision at the general meeting on whether to pursue the cross-border conversion. That decision, together with the relevant information and documents, would then be submitted to the competent national authority of the Member State of departure which is responsible to decide whether to issue a pre-conversion certificate or not. The authority would determine if all conditions for the cross-border conversion laid down in the Directive and in national law are fulfilled, including whether the company is solvent, the requisite majority of shareholders has approved the conversion at a general meeting and employees, minority shareholders and creditors are protected within the remit prescribed by the Directive. During this phase, the authority would also determine whether there is an artificial arrangement. If such an arrangement were to be established, the operation would be interrupted by the national authority of the Member State of departure even before the conversion may take place. The pre-conversion certificate shall be sent without delay to the competent authority of the Member State of destination which should examine the legality of the processing. Once the legality check has been carried out, a company would be registered in the register of a Member State of destination and deregistered in the register of a Member State of departure. The conversion shall then become legally effective. (2) Cross-border mergers : the proposal seeks to address the shortcomings in the existing texts by providing in particular for harmonised rules for the protection of creditors and shareholders. The company should provide, in the cross-border transformation project, the protection it intends to provide to creditors and shareholders. Creditors not satisfied with the protection offered could apply to the appropriate administrative or judicial authority for adequate safeguards. Shareholders who have not voted for cross-border mergers or do not have voting rights would have the right to leave the company (sell their shares) and receive adequate compensation. Furthermore, the proposed rules ensure that workers shall be informed of the implications that the proposed cross-border merger will have for workers. (3) Cross-border divisions : the proposal also simplifies the procedures allowing any capital company to carry out a cross-border division. The objectives of the harmonised rules on cross-border divisions remain similar to cross-border conversions: (i) enable companies to divide cross-border in an orderly, efficient and effective manner; (ii) protect the most affected stakeholders such as employees, creditors and shareholders in a suitable and proportionate manner. The procedure would ensure the scrutiny of legality of the cross-border division by the competent authority of the company being divided and by the authorities of the recipient companies in the light of all relevant facts and information. As in conversions, a crucial element of the procedure would be preventing a cross-border division where it is determined that it constitutes an abuse."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the western Mediterranean is one of the most developed sub-regions in terms of fisheries in the Mediterranean. It accounts for around 31 % of its total landing (EUR 1.35 billion out of a total of EUR 4.76 billion) and around 19 % of the officially reported Mediterranean fishing fleet. Demersal fisheries are highly sought after by fishermen due to their high commercial value. Demersal fisheries in the Mediterranean are highly complex and involve many species of fish and crustaceans. The main demersal species caught in the western Mediterranean are hake, red mullet, giant red shrimp, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp and Norway lobster. The main gear used for demersal species are trawl nets, which have the largest catch and fleet power, but passive gears such as trammel nets, gillnets, traps and longlines are also important. Demersal fisheries in the western Mediterranean are currently managed through national management plans adopted under Council Regulation (EC) No 1967/2006 (the ‘MedReg’). Spain, France and Italy have adopted plans in accordance with this Regulation. These plans have proved ineffective in achieving the objectives set by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (""STECF"") has shown that the exploitation of most demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean far exceeds the levels required to reach maximum sustainable yield (MSY): more than 80% assessed stocks are overfished in this sub-region. In addition, the biomass of some of these stocks is close to the limit reference point, indicating that there is a high probability of collapse. The Commission therefore considers it appropriate to establish a multiannual plan for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of demersal stocks in the western Mediterranean. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: taking into account all the evidence collected and analysed through the impact assessment process, the preferred option is a multi-annual plan at EU level. The reasons for this are as follows: the multi-annual plan would have more positive environmental impacts. In particular, the probability of achieving fishing mortality targets for all stocks would be around 36 %; around 70 % of the assessed stocks would recover to spawning stock biomass (SSB) levels above the precautionary reference point; socio-economic performance is expected to improve across all fleets by 2025; a multi-annual plan would be streamlined (a single regulatory framework), stable (it considers the long-term perspective) and transparent (the three Member States concerned would jointly bring fishing mortalities to sustainable levels). CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation aims to address the high levels of overfishing and the ineffective regulatory framework by introducing for the first time a multi-annual plan at EU level. Its aim is to achieve the objectives of the CFP Regulation in western Mediterranean demersal fisheries, namely with regards to ensure that fishing activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and managed in a way that secure economic, social and employment benefits. The plan will also facilitate implementation of the landing obligation and enable a regionalised approach, whereby the Member States concerned would be involved in the design of management measures. The proposal applies to the stocks driving demersal fisheries (i.e. hake, red mullet, deep-water rose shrimp, blue and red shrimp, giant red shrimp and Norway lobster), by-catch stocks and other demersal stocks for which sufficient data are not available. It also applies to commercial and recreational fisheries exploiting those stocks in the western Mediterranean. The proposal: lays down quantifiable targets for fishing mortality which should be achieved by 2020 at the latest. The ranges would allow for MSY-based management of the stocks concerned, while providing some flexibility in the context of mixed fisheries; introduces, for each stock, a limit reference point (or biomass limit, BLIM) at which the stock would be in serious danger of collapse and a precautionary reference point (or biomass precautionary, BPA) as a safety margin; introduces safeguard measures to allow a stock to recover in the event of the precautionary or limit reference points being exceeded; introduces a fishing effort regime at EU level for all trawls in the areas and vessels length categories in Annex I; sets a spatio-temporal closure prohibiting trawls from operating within the 100 m isobath from 1 May to 31 July each year. This would reserve the coastal zone for more selective gears in order to protect nursery areas and sensitive habitats, and enhance the social sustainability of small-scale fisheries; introduces regionalisation provisions as required to extend and/or amend exemptions for species with demonstrated high survival rates and de minimis exemptions; establishes regional cooperation among Member States with a view to adopting provisions for the landing obligation and specific conservation measures, including technical measures, for certain stocks; introduces scientific monitoring to assess progress towards maximum sustainable yield for the stocks driving demersal fisheries and, where possible, by-catch stocks. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no impact on the Union budget. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the rule of law is one of the essential values upon which the Union is founded. As recalled by Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, these values are common to the Member States. Respect for these values must therefore be ensured throughout all Union policies. This includes the EU budget, where respect for fundamental values is an essential precondition for sound financial management and effective EU funding. The Commission considers that the European Union should be given the possibility to adopt the rules necessary for the protection of the Union’s budget in the case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. The proposal is based on the 2014 Commission Communication ""A new EU framework to strengthen the rule of law"", the February 2018 Commission Communication ""A new and modern multiannual financial framework for a European Union that implements its priorities efficiently beyond 2020"" and the standards and principles developed by the Council of Europe. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation establishes the rules necessary for the protection of the Union’s budget in the case of generalised deficiencies as regards the rule of law in the Member States. Measures : appropriate measures shall be taken where a generalised deficiency as regards the rule of law in a Member State affects or risks affecting the principles of sound financial management or the protection of the financial interests of the Union such as: (i) the proper functioning of the authorities of that Member State implementing the EU budget, in particular in the context of public procurement procedures; (ii) the proper functioning of investigative services in the context of the fight against fraud and corruption; (iii) effective judicial control by independent courts of acts or omissions of the abovementioned authorities; (iv) jeopardised the independence of the judiciary. Content of measures : the proposal lists the type of measures that could be taken and specifies that Member States receiving EU funds should receive them. This concerns in particular the suspension of payments or the implementation of the legal commitment or a prohibition on entering into new legal commitments where the Commission implements the Union budget directly or indirectly. Procedure : measures should be on the basis on a Council decision following a proposal from the Commission. The decision shall be deemed to have been adopted by the Council, unless it decides, by qualified majority, to reject the Commission proposal within one month of its adoption by the Commission. The European Parliament should also be fully involved at all stages. Proportionality : measures need to be adopted in full respect of the principles of transparency and proportionality. It is also important to ensure that the consequences of measures have a sufficient connection with the aim of the funding. This also points to the need to ensure that the consequences fall on those responsible for identified shortcomings. It should therefore reflect the fact the individual beneficiaries of EU funding, such as Erasmus students, researchers or civil society organisations, cannot be considered responsible for such breaches."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fiscalis 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of Member States of the Union and of taxpayers, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The Union and the national tax authorities still suffer from insufficient capacity and insufficient cooperation – both within the EU and with third countries – to carry out effectively and efficiently their missions. They need to provide quick and joint responses to emerging problems such as tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, digitalisation and new business models, while at the same time preventing unnecessary administrative burden for citizens and businesses in cross-border transactions. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a new fiscalis programme under the Single Market, Innovation and Digital budget heading. It shall comprise means and a budget which shall support tax policy and tax authorities through administrative and IT capacity building activities and operational cooperation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the Fiscalis 2020 programme. Objective : the programme has the general objective to support tax authorities and taxation to enhance the functioning of the single market, foster Union competitiveness and protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States. It supports tax policy, tax cooperation and administrative capacity building, including human competency and the development and operation of the European electronic systems. The programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The implementation of the programme will occur through the most commonly used spending mechanisms of Union budget, namely public procurement and grants. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation provides mechanisms, means as well as the necessary funding aiming to support tax policy and to improve cooperation between tax authorities. The proposed measure comprises inter alia meetings and similar ad-hoc events, project-based structured collaboration and human competency and capacity building actions, in which Member States and their officials may participate on a voluntary basis. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of common components and national components reflecting better the reality of IT projects and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand, and the Member States on the other hand, have been listed A multi-annual strategic plan for taxation to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure jointly the development and operation, including the design, specification, conformance testing, deployment, maintenance, evolution, security, quality assurance and quality control, of the European electronic systems listed in the multi-annual strategic plan for taxation. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 270 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the rights and values programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the justice programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The general objective of the proposed rights and values programme is to protect and promote rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including by supporting civil society organisations, in order to sustain open, democratic and inclusive societies. The programme has three specific objectives: (1) Promotion of equality and rights (equality and rights strand) : preventing and combating inequalities and discrimination on grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, and supporting comprehensive policies to promote gender equality and anti-discrimination and their mainstreaming as well policies to combat racism and all forms of intolerance; protecting and promoting the rights of the child, the rights of people with disabilities, Union citizenship rights and the right to the protection of personal data. (2) Promoting citizens' engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union (citizens’s engagement and participation strand) : increasing citizens’ understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; promoting exchange and cooperation between citizens of different countries and citizens’ civic and democratic participation. (3) Combating violence (Daphne strand) : preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women and violence against other groups at risk; and supporting and protecting the victims of such violence. The programme shall provide for and accelerate the synergies between its different specific objectives in order to increase their potential to reach citizens. To be effective, the programme shall take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. Proposed budget : the programme’s overall budget is set at EUR 641.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount shall be allocated as follows: EUR 408.7 million for the ‘equality and rights’ and ‘fight against violence’ strands; EUR 233 million for the citizen engagement and participation strand."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission considers it necessary to make certain amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (Rural Development Regulation) to ensure policy continuity in the final years of the programming period and to ensure a smooth transition to the next programming period. In relation to direct payments, some of the provisions in Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 (Direct Payment Regulation) do not cover calendar year 2020 since expenditure relating to calendar year 2020 is made in financial year 2021, which is the first year of the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027. Those Member States would be faced with important changes in their direct payments and rural development envelopes with considerable effects on the payments to farmers under both pillars. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuity of support to European farmers in the years 2019 and 2020 by adapting two legislative acts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP): rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 and direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013. As regards support for rural development under Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 (EAFRD), the proposal relates to financial years 2019 – 2021, whereas the proposed modifications for direct payments under Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 relate to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. Rural development : the proposal makes it possible for the Member States to modify the degressivity schedule for payments to areas, which had received such payments in the previous programming period, while in the ongoing period, not being classified anymore as areas facing natural constraints other than mountain areas pursuant to the Rural Development Regulation. This modification would allow calculating transitional payments for the years 2019 and 2020 based on payment levels of the 2014-2020 period. The proposal extends the use of the technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission funded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) to actions related to the preparation of the future CAP. The proposal concerns exclusively the scope of technical assistance without modifying the financial support. Flexibility between pillars in year 2020 and transfer of the product of reduction of direct payments to Rural development : flexibility between pillars is an optional transfer of funds between direct payments and rural development. The proposal includes provisions regarding the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between pillars in calendar year 2020 (corresponding to financial year 2021). It calls for a transfer between pillars to remain possible in calendar year 2020 under the same conditions as currently standing and that the estimated product of reduction continues to be transferred from direct payments to rural development. In order to promptly provide the necessary flexibility to the Member States and to ensure the continuity of the rural development policy in the final years of the 20142020 programming period, this Regulation should apply from 1 March 2019. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal does not have any financial implications in terms of increased expenditure. The effect of the proposed provisions giving Member States an option to transfer amounts between direct payments allocations in calendar year 2020/financial year 2021 and EAFRD in financial year 2021 as well as the transfer of the estimated product of reduction from direct payments in calendar year 2020 to EAFRD in financial year 2021 will depend on Member States’ implementation and can therefore not be quantified at present. Such transfers will in any case remain neutral with regard to overall commitment appropriations in the way that any deductions from the direct payments allocations will be off-set by a corresponding increase in the EAFRD allocations and vice versa."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the fisheries partnership Agreement between the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire and the European Community entered into force on 18 April 2008. The previous Protocol to the Agreement entered into force on 1 July 2013 and expired on 30 June 2018. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Côte d’Ivoire with a view to concluding a new Protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Côte d’Ivoire. Following those negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 16 March 2018. It shall cover a period of six years from the date of its provisional application. It is now necessary for this Protocol to be approved on behalf of the European Union. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol on the implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire (2018-2024). The main objective of the Protocol is to enable the European Union and the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire to work more closely together on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy, sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Côte d’Ivoire waters, and Côte d’Ivoire's efforts to develop a blue economy. It also aims to provide fishing opportunities for Union vessels in Côte d’Ivoire waters, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and following the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: Joint committee: the partnership Agreement establishes the joint committee responsible for monitoring its implementation. Furthermore, in accordance with the Protocol, this joint committee may approve certain amendments to the Protocol. In order to facilitate the approval of such amendments, the Commission should be empowered, subject to specific conditions, to approve them under a simplified procedure.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 31 March 2016, the Council adopted negotiating directives which authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the European Union, an international agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the delegations from Canada, China, Denmark in respect of the Faroe Islands and Greenland, Iceland, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Russia and the United States of America with a view to concluding a binding Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. The Agreement seeks to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the high seas portion of the central Arctic Ocean, an area that is roughly 2.8 million square kilometres in size. Commercial fishing has never been known to occur in this area, nor is it likely to occur in the near future. However, given the changing conditions of the Arctic Ocean, the governments in question developed this Agreement in accordance with the precautionary approach to fisheries management. CONTENT: the present proposal calls on the Council to adopt the decision to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement to prevent unregulated high seas fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. Becoming a Party to the Agreement will promote consistency in the Union's conservation approach across oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long term conservation and sustainable use of marine biological resources globally. The Agreement will establish and operate a joint programme of scientific research and monitoring with the aim of improving the understanding of the ecosystem(s) of this area and, in particular, of determining whether fish stocks might exist in this area that could be harvested on a sustainable basis. Once entered into force, the Agreement will close an important regulatory gap in the current International ocean governance framework."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: fraud affecting the EU's financial interests is a cross-border phenomenon affecting all EU Member States. Experience shows that the Union's financial interests are impacted by both fraud and irregularities. The implementation of the past Union multi-annual budgets has been accompanied by a set of measures to support the Member States and the Union as a whole in preventing and fighting fraud affecting the Union's financial interests, and supporting mutual administrative assistance and cooperation in customs and agriculture matters. These measures include: the Hercule III spending programme which supports activities against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Union; the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS) which is an operational activity consisting essentially in a set of customs IT applications operated under a common information system managed by the Commission; the Irregularity Management System (IMS) which is a secure electronic communications tool which facilitates the Member States' obligation to report detected irregularities, including fraud, and which supports the management and analysis of these. Although it is difficult to quantify their financial impact, these measures have contributed to bringing back large amounts of money into the EU budget. For example, Hercule funded the development of the Automated Monitoring Tool (AMT), an IT tool that identifies anomalies in trade flows and was instrumental in identifying large undervaluation fraud schemes in the import of textile and footwear from third countries in 2017. This proposal aims at streamlining the financial support for these tools, for the duration of the next multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027. The Commission stressed that the next multiannual financial framework shall be implemented against the background of significant changes in the legislative and institutional framework for the protection of the Union's financial interests, in particular with the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the implementation of Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and the Council on the fight against fraud to the Union's financial interests by means of criminal law. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the EU anti-fraud programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme is intended to replace the Hercule III programme and shall have a budget of EUR 181 million for the period 2021-2027. Its general objectives shall be to protect the financial interests of the Union and to support mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters. The specific objectives of the programme shall be threefold: assist Member States and the European Union to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities affecting the EU's financial interests, by financing activities (technical assistance and training) which otherwise might not be available at national level (EUR 114.2 million); support the reporting of irregularities, including fraud, with regard to the shared management and pre-accession assistance funds of the Union budget (EUR 7 million); provide tools for information exchange and support for operational activities in the field of mutual administrative assistance in customs and agricultural matters (EUR 60 million). Implementation : the proposal specifies how the programme shall be implemented through grants, including the possible beneficiaries of the grants. The latter include public authorities which are likely to contribute to the achievement of one of the objectives of the programme, from any of the following countries: a Member State or an overseas country or territory linked to it, a third country associated with the programme or a third country listed in a work programme. The programme shall be implemented by OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: a third of the EU's land suffers from water stress all year round and water scarcity remains an important concern for many EU Member States. Increasingly unpredictable weather patterns, including severe droughts, are also likely to have negative consequences on both the quantity and quality of freshwater resources. Between 1976 and 2006, the number of areas and people affected by droughts went up by almost 20% and the total costs of droughts amounted to EUR 100 billion (EC, 2012). Agricultural irrigation by far is the largest application of reused water worldwide and in Europe and a significant use of water in Europe, overall accounting for around a quarter of total freshwater abstracted. By encouraging the reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation, the EU could therefore improve its capacity to respond to increasing pressures on water resources. The need to address the problem at EU level has been acknowledged in the 2012 Commission Communication ‘A Blueprint to Safeguard Europe's Water Resources’. A Fitness check of EU Freshwater policy published in November 2012 as a building block of the Blueprint, concluded that ‘alternative water supply options with low environmental impact need to be further relied upon’ in order to address water scarcity. Furthermore, the European Parliament, in its September 2015 Resolution on the follow-up to the European Citizens’ Initiative Right2Water encouraged the Commission to draw up a legislative framework on water reuse. Two instruments in force in the Union encourage the reuse of water, without however specifying the conditions in this respect. These are the Water Framework Directive ( 2000/60/EC ) and the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC). IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option for agricultural irrigation is a legal instrument with a ‘fit for purpose’ approach (minimum requirements set depending on the food crop category and irrigation technique) and protection of local public health and of the environment (the key risk management tasks). It is estimated that the proposed instrument could lead to 6.6 billion m3 of water per year being reused for agricultural irrigation, compared to 1.7 billion m3 if the EU did not establish a legal framework. CONTENT: the Regulation proposed by the Commission aims to mitigate water shortages in the EU, in the context of adaptation to climate change. It would ensure that treated waste water for agricultural irrigation is safe, protecting people and the environment. More specifically, the proposal: defines the minimum water quality and monitoring requirements to be met and the obligation to perform certain essential risk management tasks in order to enable the safe reuse of urban waste water as part of integrated water management. These requirements should consist of a minimum of parameters for reclaimed water and other stricter or additional quality requirements, imposed, if necessary, by the competent authorities together with appropriate preventive measures; defines the process of risk management that should be carried out by the operator of a reclamation plant in cooperation with relevant parties (the end-user of the reclaimed water, the urban waste water treatment plant supplying water to the reclamation plant, etc.). The reclamation plant operator shall elaborate a water reuse risk management plan identifying additional requirements to further mitigate risks, which would be part of a permit issued by the competent authority; ensure transparency and access to information in order to increase user and public confidence in the safety of reused water: the public will have access to information online about water reuse practice in their Member States. With regard to access to justice, it should be possible for citizens and NGOs to legally review the decisions taken by Member States under this Regulation. The proposed Regulation sets the date of entry into force and the date of application, i.e. one year after the date of entry into force in order to provide sufficient time to the Member States to adapt to the Regulation, as well as to elaborate an implementing act ensuring the uniform application of the risk management."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the internal market is one of the EU’s greatest successes. Nevertheless, it has to continuously adapt to a rapidly changing environment characterised by digital revolution and globalisation. Still, barriers to a proper functioning of the internal market remain and new obstacles are emerging. Moreover, only 6 % of EU citizens feel well informed about their rights as a citizen of the Union and only 36 % feel fairly well informed. Action is required at EU level to ensure the consistent development of the internal market; non-discrimination; consumer protection; effective competition; the development of Member States’ capabilities and of cooperation between them; and the tackling of cross-border issues. Under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, the proposed new programme brings together activities financed under five previous programmes in the areas of business competitiveness (COSME), consumer protection (Regulation (EU) No 254/2014), customers and end-users in financial services (Regulation (EU) 2017/826), policy making in financial services (Regulation (EU) 258/2014) and the food chain (Regulation (EU) 652/2014) respectively. All of these activities are united by their shared objectives to regulate, implement, facilitate, enforce and protect various activities and actors within the internal market. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the programme for improving the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness of enterprises, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and the framework for financing of development, production and dissemination of European statistics. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021 to 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The scope of the proposed programme covers the areas of the internal market, SME competitiveness and European statistics in a comprehensive way. The specific objectives of the programme are as follows: making the internal market work better : the objective is to facilitate the prevention and removal of obstacles and to support the development, implementation and enforcement of the Union law in the areas of the internal market for goods and services, public procurement, market surveillance as well as in the areas of company law and contract and extra-contractual law, anti-money laundering, free movement of capital, financial services and competition, including the development of governance tools; improving the competitiveness of businesses, especially SMEs : improving the competitiveness of enterprises, in particular SMEs: building on the success of the current COSME programme, the Commission proposes to strengthen support for small enterprises to facilitate their access to markets, including the internationalisation of SMEs, the business environment, the competitiveness of certain sectors, the modernisation of industry and the promotion of entrepreneurship. SME loan guarantees previously granted under the COSME programme shall now be granted under the SME component of InvestEU; increasing standardisation : the programme shall also enable the financing of European standardisation and stakeholder participation in setting up European standards. It shall support the development of high-quality international financial reporting and auditing standards; promoting the interests of consumers : the programme shall empower, assist and educate consumers, businesses and civil society by: (i) ensuring a high level of consumer protection, sustainable consumption and product safety notably by supporting competent enforcement authorities and consumer representative organisations and cooperation actions; (ii) ensuring that all consumers have access to redress and; provision of adequate information on markets and consumers; (iii) enhancing the participation of consumers, other financial services end-users and civil society in financial services policy-making; (iv) promoting a better understanding of the financial sector; contributing to a high level of health for humans, animals and plants throughout the food chain : funding shall support the safe production of food, the prevention and eradication of animal diseases and plant pests, and the improvement of animal welfare in the EU. It shall also promote market access for EU food producers, contribute to exports to third-countries, and significantly support the agri-food industry as a leading sector of the EU economy; producing and communicating high-quality statistics on Europe : the programme establishes the financial framework for providing high-quality, comparable and reliable European statistics to underpin the design, monitoring and evaluation of all the Union policies. This replaces the predecessor European statistical programme. The proposed programme also includes new initiatives aimed at improving the functioning of the internal market, such as the initiative ‘An ambitious and innovative competition policy for a stronger Union in the digital age, Joint Cluster Initiative’ (e.g. to respond to market developments linked to the use of big data and algorithms) and the initiative for collaborations between clusters or clusters of businesses. Implementation of the Programme shall be based on annual or multi-annual work programme or programmes. The contribution of the programme to the overall objective of increasing the share of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives to 25% shall be monitored. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 4.089 billion for the period 2021-2027. This shall be supplemented by an allocation of EUR 2 billion from the InvestEU Fund, in particular its SME window, which shall make a significant contribution to achieving the objectives of the Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 has been substantially amended several times. On 1 April 1987, the Commission decided to instruct its staff that all acts should be codified after no more than ten amendments, stressing that this is a minimum requirement. The Edinburgh European Council in December 1992 confirmed this imperative by stressing the importance of codification. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission agreed by an Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 December 1994 that an accelerated procedure may be used for the fast track adoption of codification instruments. CONTENT: for the sake of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Regulation (EC) No 768/2005 establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency and amending Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93 establishing a control system applicable to the common fisheries policy. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. Objective : the proposed Regulation provides for a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with the objective of: organising operational coordination of fisheries control and inspection activities by the Member States; assisting Member States to cooperate so as to comply with the rules of the common fisheries policy in order to ensure its effective and uniform application. The Agency's mission shall be to: coordinate : (i) controls and inspections of fisheries by EU countries; (ii) the deployment of national means of control and inspection pooled by EU countries; (iii) operations to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; assist Member States in (i) providing the European Commission and other interested parties with information on fishing activities and control and inspection activities; (ii) fulfilling their obligations under fisheries policy rules; assist Member States and the Commission in harmonising the implementation of the Common Fisheries Policy throughout the Union; contribute to the research and development work carried out by the Member States and the Commission on control and inspection techniques; (ii) coordinate the training of inspectors and the sharing of experience between the Member States; (iii) contribute to the harmonised implementation of the control system of the common fisheries policy; cooperate with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the European Maritime Safety Agency, each within its own mandate, to support national authorities carrying out coast guard functions, by providing services, information, equipment and training, as well as coordinating multi-purpose operations. The Agency shall, at the Commission's request: assist the Union and Member States in their relations with third countries and regional international fisheries organisations of which the Union is a member; cooperate with the competent authorities of regional international fisheries organisations regarding the control and inspection obligations of the Union in the framework of working arrangements concluded with such bodies. The Agency shall coordinate operational cooperation between Member States in accordance with joint deployment plans, which organise the use of the available means of control and inspection of the Member States concerned so as to give effect to control and inspection programmes. Fisheries control and inspection activities undertaken by the Member States should be carried out in accordance with common criteria, priorities, benchmarks and procedures regarding control and inspection activities on the basis of such programmes. Organisation : the Agency, based in Vigo, Spain, shall consist of: (i) an Executive Director appointed for a five-year term; (ii) an Advisory Board to assist the Executive Director; and (iii) an Administrative Board (composed of one representative from each EU country and six Commission representatives) which, inter alia, appoints the Executive Director."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 1152/2003/EC is the founding decision for the computerised system (Excise Movement and Control System – EMCS). At the moment it covers only movements of excise goods under excise duty suspension. In order to allow the automation of the procedure for the movement of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State, Decision No 1152/2003/EC has to be modified. Since most provisions of the Decisions are affected by such modification, the Decision should be recast in the interests of clarity. This proposal accompanies the proposal for a Council Directive laying down the general arrangement for excise duty as regards the automation of the procedure for movements of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and that are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to extend the excise movement and control system to intra EU movements of excise goods that are released for consumption, in order to simplify the procedure and allow for proper monitoring of such movements, and to provide a base for the governance of further automations of processes defined by Union excise legislation, where such automation is considered beneficial. It is proposed to amend most of the provisions of Decision No 1152/2003/EC so as to allow the possibility of automating any procedure used for the movement and control of excise goods. Specifically, the computerised system is intended to: permit the electronic transmission of the accompanying documents and the improvement of checks; improve the functioning of the internal market, by simplifying the intra-Union movement of excise goods and affording Member States the possibility of monitoring the flows in real time and of carrying out the requisite checks where necessary."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: conflict of laws rules governing the third-party (or proprietary) effects of assignments of claims do not currently exist at Union level. These conflict of laws rules are laid down at Member State level, but they are inconsistent and often unclear. In cross border assignments of claims, the inconsistency of national conflict of laws rules leads to legal uncertainty as to which law applies to the third-party effects of the assignments. The assignment of a claim is a legal mechanism whereby a creditor (""assignor"") transfers his right to claim a debt to another person (""assignee""). A claim gives a creditor the right to receive a sum of money or to the performance of an obligation by the debtor. This mechanism is used by companies to obtain liquidity and have access to credit, so-called factoring and collateralisation respectively, and by companies (most often banks) to optimise the use of their capital, also called securitisation. Factoring is a crucial source of liquidity for many firms. The majority of users of factoring are SMEs: Small represent 76%, Medium 11% and Large 13%. Europe as a region is the largest factoring market world-wide and represents 66% of the world market. As part of the Action Plan on Capital Markets Union (CMU) and the Mid-Term Review, the Commission announced targeted action on rules on the ownership of securities and the third-party effects of assignments of claims to reduce legal uncertainty for cross-border transactions in securities and claims. This proposal and the Communication on the law applicable to the proprietary effects of transactions in securities, presented in parallel, implement this commitment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: five options have been studied in the impact assessment. The proposal is based on the option that the law of the assignor's habitual residence is a general rule but with certain assignments subject, as an exception, to the law of the assigned claim and with a choice of law possibility for securitisation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation concerns the law applicable to cross-border transactions involving claims or securities. It does not cover the transfer of the contracts (for example derivative contracts), in which both rights (or claims) and obligations are included. The proposal aims to: contribute to the objective of encouraging cross-border investment by reducing the legal uncertainty that may discourage cross-border assignments of claims or lead to additional costs for those transactions; protect investors by reducing losses that may occur when market participants are unaware of the legal risk arising from legal uncertainty; harmonise the conflict of law rules on the third-party effects of assignments of claims, the proposal will provide legal certainty to parties involved in factoring, collateralisation and securitisation and thereby facilitate access to cheaper finance for SMEs and consumers. The solution which the Commission proposes is a general rule that in conflict situations the law of the assignor's habitual residence applies. The law of the assignor's habitual residence is easy to determine and most likely to be the place in which the main insolvency proceedings with respect to the assignor will be opened. The proposal is also particularly suitable for bulk assignments and assignments of receivables under future contracts, which are an important source of finance for SMEs. It is the only law which is consistent with the Union acquis on insolvency, that is, the Insolvency Regulation. The Commission proposes, however, that the law of the assigned claim applies to two types of specific claims, which are therefore exempted from the general rule: cash on the account of a credit institution (for example a bank, where the consumer is the creditor and the credit institution is the debtor); claims derived from financial instruments, such as derivatives. In addition, for securitisation transactions, the Commission proposes a choice between the law of the assignor and the law of the assigned claim."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty provides that the European Parliament and the Council are to establish the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency (Article 133 TFEU). Among these measures is the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. On the basis of this article, the protection of the euro as the single currency is the responsibility of the EU. Counterfeiting of the euro poses a true problem for the Union and for its institutions. Its threats are still substantial, as demonstrated by the increasing availability of high quality counterfeit euro's and security features on the internet/darknet and the existence of counterfeiting hotspots, e.g. in Colombia, Peru and China. Considering the cross-border circulation of the euro and the deep involvement of international organised crime in euro counterfeiting (production and distribution), it is necessary that national protection frameworks be complemented by an EU initiative to ensure homogeneous national and international cooperation, and to face possible emerging transnational risks. The current 2020 Pericles programme is specifically dedicated to the protection of euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting. In the mid-term evaluation of the programme, the Commission came to the conclusion that the continuation of the Pericles 2020 programme beyond 2020 should be supported, given its EU added value, its long-term impact and the sustainability of its actions. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Pericles IV programme, an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The proposed new programme aims to protect euro banknotes and coins against counterfeiting and related fraud, by supporting and supplementing the measures undertaken by the Member States and; by assisting the competent national and Union authorities in their efforts to develop among themselves and with the Commission a close and regular cooperation and an exchange of best practice, where appropriate including third countries and international organisations. In particular, the programme shall take responsibility for tackling specific emerging threats (such as deep/dark web) and the relationship with certain countries (e.g. China), as it is difficult for individual Member States to effectively address these threats on their own. Implementation : the programme shall be implemented through direct management by the Commission. Financial support for eligible actions shall be granted under the programme in the form of grants or public contracts. Actions under the programme may be organised jointly by the Commission and other partners having relevant expertise, such as: the national central banks and the European Central Bank (ECB); the National Analysis Centres (NACs) and the Coin National Analysis Centres; the European Technical and Scientific Centre and the mints; Europol, Eurojust and Interpol. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 7.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount is in line with the Commission proposal for the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027."

With a total EUR 208 billion of trade in goods and EUR 77 billion of trade in services (2016), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) taken as a whole is the EU’s third largest trading partner outside Europe, after the US and China. Within the ASEAN, Singapore is by far the EU’s largest partner. On 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Member States of the ASEAN. On 12 September 2011, the Council authorised the Commission to extend the on-going negotiations with Singapore to cover also investment protection, based on a new EU competence under the Lisbon Treaty. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in 2011 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Singapore an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to adopt the Decision to conclude the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Singapore. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured the following: Trade committee: the institutional chapter of the FTA establishes a trade committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement. It shall be comprised of representatives of the EU and of Singapore who will meet every two years or at the request of either side. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the EU-Singapore FTA will have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the revenues. It is estimated that foregone duties could reach an amount of EUR 248.8 million upon full implementation of the agreement. The estimate is based on average imports projected for 2025 in the absence of an agreement and represents the annual loss in revenues resulting from the elimination of EU tariffs on imports from Singapore. The EU-Singapore IPA is expected to have a financial impact on the EU budget on the side of the expenditures. The agreement will be the EU’s second (after the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) to incorporate the Investment Court System (ICS) for the resolution of disputes between investors and states. An amount of EUR 200 000 of additional yearly expenditure is foreseen from 2018 onwards (subject to the entry into force of the agreement) to finance the permanent structure comprising a First Instance and an Appeal Tribunal."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 25 November 2004, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with six ASEAN countries, including Singapore. Negotiations with Singapore were launched in October 2005 and finalised in May 2013. The two sides initialled the PCA in Singapore on 14 October 2013. Negotiations were carried out in consultation with the Working Party on Asia and the Pacific (COASI), as a consultative committee. Following the adoption of the Council Decision on the signing of the Agreement on 16 of July 2018, the Agreement was signed on 19 October 2018 in Brussels. The PCA with Singapore is the fifth agreement with an ASEAN country, following the agreements with Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia. It will supersede the current legal framework of the 1980 Cooperation Agreement between the European Economic Community and member countries of the Association of South-East Asian Nations. CONTENT: the Commission called on the Council to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and its Member States, of the one part, and the Republic of Singapore, of the other part. This agreement with Singapore constitutes a stepping stone towards enhanced political and economic involvement of the EU in South-East Asia. It will provide the basis for more effective bilateral engagement by the EU and its Member States with Singapore by strengthening political dialogue and enhancing cooperation in a broad range of areas. The agreement covers the EU’s standard political clauses on human rights, International Criminal Court (ICC), Weapons of Mass Destructions (WMD), Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) and counter-terrorism. It also provides for the possibility of suspending the application of the Agreement or of any specific agreement in case of a violation of essential elements of the agreement, i.e. the human rights clause and the non-proliferation clause. It also encompasses cooperation in areas such as: The agreement establishes a Joint Committee to ensure the proper functioning and implementation of the Agreement.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: for the next multiannual financial framework covering the period 2021-2017, the Commission proposes to modernise cohesion policy to help redress imbalances within and between Member States. Given that the rules applicable were overly complex and fragmented between the different funds and the various forms of financing, this proposal for a Regulation aims to establish common provisions for seven funds, namely (i) the Cohesion Fund (CF), (ii) the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF), (iii) the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), (iv) the European Social Fund plus (ESF+), (v) the Asylum and Migration Fund (AMIF), (vi) the Border Management and Visa Instrument (BMVI) and (vii) the Internal Security Fund (ISF). CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to create a common set of simplified and consolidated rules covering seven EU funds. The main elements of the Commission proposal are as follows: Shared management and partnership : part of the budget of the Union allocated to the Funds should be implemented by the Commission under shared management with Member States. Each Member State should organise partnerships with local and regional authorities, urban and public authorities, economic and social partners, civil society and bodies promoting social inclusion, fundamental rights, gender equality, non-discrimination and the rights of people with disabilities. The contribution of EU programmes to the overall objective of increasing the share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25% shall be tracked through an EU climate marker system. Strategic approach : the Commission proposes to reduce the eleven thematic objectives used for the period 2014-2020 to five clear policy objectives: a smarter Europe by promoting innovative and smart economic transformation; a greener, low-carbon Europe by promoting clean and fair energy transition, green and blue investment, the circular economy, climate adaptation and risk prevention and management; a more connected Europe by enhancing mobility and regional ICT connectivity; a more social Europe implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights; a Europe closer to citizens by fostering the sustainable and integrated development of urban, rural and coastal areas and local initiatives. Simplification : the proposal aims at significantly reducing the unnecessary administrative burden for beneficiaries and management bodies while maintaining a high level of assurance on legality and regularity. Among other things, it provides for: the use of simplified cost options, i.e. flat-rate reimbursement, standard scales of unit costs or flat-rate amounts; the possibility of payments based on conditions; the abolition of specific rules for revenue generating investments and of the procedure applicable to major projects; simplified financing, for example through the use of the ‘seal of excellence’; the extension of the single audit principle, fewer controls and an enhanced proportionate approach for programmes with a low error rate. The proposal also increases the flexibility needed to meet emerging needs: allowing limited financial transfers between EU programmes; creating flexibility for the ERDF, ESF+ and the Cohesion Fund: only the first 5 years will be programmed initially. Allocations for the last 2 years will be made on the basis of a substantial and in-depth mid-term review leading to corresponding reprogramming in 2025; enabling voluntary transfer of resources towards the five policy windows of the InvestEU instruments to benefit from an EU-level budgetary guarantee mechanism. Lastly, the proposal seeks to align the programmes more closely with EU priorities and increase their effectiveness, in particular by creating a closer link with the European Semester to improve the investment climate in Europe. Conditionality linked to the European Semester shall be simplified. In particular, country-specific recommendations (CSRs) shall be taken into account in programming at least on two occasions: at the beginning of the programming and during the mid-term review. Proposed overall budget : the Commission proposal for a multiannual financial framework sets an envelope of EUR 330 billion for economic, social and territorial cohesion for the period 2021-2027: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF): EUR 200.62 billion , of which (i) investment for jobs and growth: EUR 190.75 billion; (II) European territorial cooperation: EUR 8.43 billion; (iii) outermost and sparsely populated regions: EUR 1.44 billion. Cohesion Fund (CF): EUR 41.34 billion , of which contribution to the Connecting Europe Facility - Transport: EUR 10 billion. European Social Fund+: EUR 88.64 billion . The Commission proposal for the financing of the EMFF, AMIF, BMVI and ISF shall be included in fund specific Regulations."

BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. These programmes have led to real progress in promoting values and implementing the rights that EU legislation grant to people across the Union. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the justice programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the rights and values programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The programme has the general objective of contributing to the further development of a European area of justice based on the rule of law, on mutual recognition and mutual trust between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings. The programme has three specific objectives: to facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law including by supporting the efforts to improve the effectiveness of national justice systems and the enforcement of decision; to support and promote judicial training, with a view to fostering a common legal, judicial and rule of law culture; to facilitate effective access to justice for all and effective redress, including by electronic means, by promoting efficient civil and criminal procedures and by promoting and supporting the rights of victims of crime as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. In concrete terms, the programme seeks to enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting: information and public awareness raising , including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteed under Union law, and how to enforce them in practice; training and capacity building for legal professionals in order to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice; cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through strengthening networks, i.e. Union-wide organisations to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe and cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishing missing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-border anti-drug cooperation. The Commission shall ensure the European added value of all actions and activities carried out under the programme, their complementarity with Member States' activities and their compatibility with other Union activities. It shall set establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. Participation is open to all legal entities legally established in a Member State or in a participating non EU country, with no further restrictions on access to the programme. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 305 million for the period 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the area of justice requires judicial cooperation across borders. For this purpose, and to facilitate the proper functioning of the internal market, the EU adopted Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters and Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence. These instruments are crucial in the regulation of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Member States. In 2018, approximately 3.4 million civil and commercial court proceedings in the EU have cross-border implications. In many such proceedings, there is a need to obtain evidence from another Member State; the Regulation on the taking of evidence provides tools that facilitate access to that evidence. In 2017, to support relevant, comprehensive and up-to-date analysis and conclusions on the practical operation of the Regulation, the Commission undertook a regulatory fitness (REFIT) evaluation. The findings showed that contacts between the bodies designated by the Regulation are still almost exclusively paper-based, with adverse impacts on cost and effectiveness. Also, videoconferencing is rarely used to hear persons in another Member State. The proposal therefore addresses the need for modernisation, in particular digitalisation and the use of modern technology in the cross-border taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters. It also addresses the following other problems highlighted by the evaluation: delays and costs for citizens, businesses and Member States, shortcomings in the protection of procedural rights and legal complexity and uncertainty. The proposal is closely linked to the proposal amending the Regulation on cross-border service. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a policy package involving a number of measures: using electronic transmission as the default channel for electronic communication and document exchanges; promoting modern means of taking evidence such as videoconferencing if a person needs to be heard from another Member State and incentives (via the financing of national projects) for Member States to equip courts with videoconferencing facilities; removing legal barriers to the acceptance of electronic (digital) evidence; tackling divergent interpretations of the term ‘court’; raising courts’ and legal professionals’ awareness of the availability of the direct channel of taking evidence under the Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal aims to improve the efficiency and speed of obtaining cross-border evidence. To this end, it adapts Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 to technical developments, exploiting the advantages of digitisation and ensuring greater use of videoconferencing. In concrete terms, the proposed amendments: define the term ‘court’ to mean any judicial authority in a Member State which is competent for the performance of taking of evidence according to this Regulation; introduce the mandatory electronic transmission, as a rule, of requests and communications. In exceptional cases, i.e. where the system is interrupted or not suitable for the transmission in question (e.g. transmission of a DNA sample as evidence), other channels can still be used; ensure a more appropriate, more frequent and faster use of direct taking of evidence via videoconference, where available to the courts in question and appropriate in the light of the specific circumstances of the case; facilitate the taking of evidence by diplomatic officers or consular agents. The Article provides that such persons may, in the territory of another Member State and in the area where they exercise their functions, take evidence without the need for a prior request, by hearing nationals of the Member State which they represent without compulsion in the context of proceedings pending in the courts of that Member State; ensure that digital evidence taken in accordance with the law of the Member State where it was taken is not rejected as evidence in other Member States solely due to its digital nature. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not impose significant costs on national administrations, but rather lead to savings. Costs relating to the development, implementation and maintenance of electronic communication and document exchanges, and to the acquisition, implementation and operation of professional, high-end videoconferencing equipment could be co-funded. The main EU funding opportunities under the current financial programmes are the Justice programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package for the digital transformation priority, as unveiled on 2 May 2018, includes EUR 3 billion for a digital strand of the CEF, to finance digital connectivity infrastructure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 2008, Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 on the service of documents provides for fast-track channels and uniform procedures for transmitting documents from one Member State to another. Together with Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation in the taking of evidence, it is a crucial instrument in the regulation of judicial assistance in civil and commercial matters between the Member States. In 2018, approximately 3.4 million civil and commercial court proceedings in the EU have cross-border implications. In most of these cases (namely in those where at least one party resides in another Member State than the one where the proceedings takes place), courts often apply the Regulation on service of documents several times in the course of the proceedings. This is because additional documents often have to be served formally (such as the decisions closing the proceedings), in addition to the document instituting the proceedings. In 2017, to support the analysis of the practical application of the Regulation, the Commission undertook a regulatory fitness (REFIT) evaluation, On the traditional channel of transmission of a document to another Member State for purposes of service there - transmission through the so-called transmitting and receiving agencies - the evaluation revealed that this workflow is underperforming in that it still works more slowly and less efficiently than expected. The deadlines proposed in the Regulation are regularly exceeded and modern channels of communication are in practice not used. The evaluation also concluded that as regards the alternative methods of transmission and service of documents providing direct channels to serve documents in the territory of other Member States, the evaluation concluded that although they provide smoother solutions to assist cross-border judicial proceedings, there are ways in which they could be improved : service by post under the Regulation is a popular, quick and relatively cheap way of delivering the document to the addressee, but it is not very reliable and has a high failure rate. The so-called direct service provides a reliable solution but access to it is limited. This proposal is closely linked to the proposal amending the Regulation on the taking of evidence. The two proposals are presented together by the Commission, and constitute a package for the modernisation of judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: as part of the preferred package, the effectiveness of the current regulation would be improved, mainly by reducing costs and delays. In particular, the impact assessment identified two changes that should be useful: mandatory electronic communication between the agencies and the facilitation of electronic and direct service. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 sets up a framework of judicial cooperation aligned with the digital single market strategy. It will help improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border proceedings by reducing the time spent on sending documents between agencies and by reducing reliance on paper-based communication. Specifically, the proposal: provides that the communication and exchange of documents between sending and receiving authorities is carried electronically, through a decentralised IT system made up of national IT systems interconnected by a secure and reliable communication infrastructure; ensures that alternative (traditional) means of communication are used in cases of unforeseen and exceptional disruption of the IT system; requires Member States to provide assistance in locating the whereabouts of a recipient in another Member State if the initiator of the service of the document either does not have any such information (‘whereabouts unknown’) or if the information at his/her disposal turns out to be incorrect; improves the procedure on the right of the addressee to refuse to accept the document if it is not drawn up or translated into an appropriate language; obliges the postal service providers to use a specific return slip (acknowledgement of receipt) when serving documents by post under the Regulation; introduces a minimum standard concerning persons to be regarded as eligible ‘substituting recipients’ if the postal service provider cannot hand over the document on the addressee in person; introduces a new measure to facilitate access to the direct service of documents, by extending the scope of application of the Regulation. Allowing direct service both for (i) transmitting agencies or (ii) the courts seised with the proceedings in the Member State of origin and in the territory of all Member States would lead to more direct and speedy transmission of documents compared to the baseline; introduces the electronic service of documents as an additional alternative method of service under the Regulation; requires the court seised with the proceedings to send an alert message about the initiation of the proceedings or about the default judgment to the available user account of the defendant in absentia and sets the time period for the availability of the extraordinary review to two years as of the issuance of the default judgment. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal will not impose significant costs on national administrations, but rather lead to savings. The main costs for Member States will come from the implementation of electronic communication as mandatory for transmitting and receiving agencies. The main EU funding opportunities under the current financial programmes are the Justice programme and the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF). The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) package for the digital transformation priority, as unveiled on 2 May 2018, includes EUR 3 billion for a digital strand of the CEF, to finance digital connectivity infrastructure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Within the Union, the freedom for the Member States' road haulage operators to provide international carriage of goods by road is regulated primarily on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009, which lay down the common rules for the access to the occupation of road transport operator and for access to the international road haulage market, respectively. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, road freight transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulations upon withdrawal. This would result in the loss of validity of Community licences issued by the United Kingdom to road haulage operators until the withdrawal date, and thereby loss of access to the Union’s road haulage market for holders of such licences. Similarly, European Union road haulage operators, on the basis of the existing Community licences, would equally lose automatic access to the United Kingdom’s road freight transport market. More than 80% of road haulage transport between the United Kingdom and the EU-27 is currently carried out by carriers established in the EU-27. In order to avoid serious disruptions and any risk of disturbing public order, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary emergency measures enabling road haulage operators licensed in the United Kingdom to carry goods by road between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to allow UK operators to temporarily transport goods to the EU for 9 months (until 31 December 2019), provided that the United Kingdom grants equivalent rights to EU road hauliers and subject to the conditions of fair competition. The proposal complements the Union rules regulating the carriage of goods by road, in particular Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009. Ensure basic connectivity This proposed act would establish basic connectivity subject to equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom. Such connectivity would be ensured in an equal manner for traffic to and from all points in the Union, which avoids distortions in the internal market. The proposed Regulation lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union road haulage operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to UK road haulage operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts, including the limitation to the allowable capacity available to UK road haulage operators or to the number of journeys or to both. Fair competition The proposed Regulation, even though it aims to temporarily ensure basic connectivity for road freight transport, lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators once the United Kingdom will no longer be bound by Union law. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high and comparable standards in the area of road freight transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers and a high level of road safety; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) granting of licences to road haulage operators or to the qualification, training and medical controls for professional drivers. Moreover, it must be ensured that Union carriers are not discriminated against in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the conditions for the granting of the Union operating licence to air carriers and establishes the freedom to provide intra-EU air services. In the absence of any provisions to the contrary in a withdrawal agreement, air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would cease to be governed by the said Regulation upon withdrawal. Moreover, certain air carriers, by reason of their holding an operating licence issued by the United Kingdom, or their principal place of business being located in the United Kingdom, or their being majority owned or effectively controlled by the United Kingdom or its nationals, would cease to meet the conditions laid down in the said Regulation to qualify as Union carriers. The carriers in any of the situations described above would lose their Union operating licence and, as a consequence, no longer enjoy the right to provide intra-Union air services. Direct air transport services between the United Kingdom and the Member States are almost entirely in the hands of United Kingdom and Union air carriers. The loss by those air carriers of their right to provide air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States would therefore result in serious disruption. Most, if not all, air routes between the Union and the United Kingdom would cease to be served. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The Commission considers it necessary to establish a temporary set of measures enabling carriers licensed in the United Kingdom to provide air transport services between the territory of the latter and the remaining 27 Member States. CONTENT: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down provisional measures to govern air transport between the Union and the United Kingdom following the latter's withdrawal from the Union. This proposal complements Union Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. Although the approach followed in the Union's air transport agreements with third countries has been respected in some areas (e.g. operating authorisations), the specific purpose and context of this Regulation, as well as its unilateral nature, necessarily require a more restrictive approach in the grant of rights, as well as specific provisions intended to preserve equality of rights and a level playing field. Maintain basic connectivity The proposed Regulation provides for the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories. No distinction is made between passenger and cargo operations, or scheduled and non-scheduled services. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a short transition period ending 30 March, 2020. Reciprocity and fair competition The measures would enter into force subject to the United Kingdom granting equivalent rights to EU air carriers and ensuring fair competition. Otherwise, the Commission would be empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts, including the limitation or withdrawal of operating authorisations of United Kingdom air carriers. A level playing field requires that, even after the withdrawal, the United Kingdom continues to apply sufficiently high standards in the area of air transport as regards: (i) fair competition; (ii) the prohibition of unjustified government subsidies; (iii) the protection of workers; (iv) the protection of the environment; (v) safety and security; (vi) non-discrimination of EU carriers in the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Union. For that purpose, a system of certificates has been established for various aviation activities, in order to achieve the required safety levels and to enable the necessary verifications and the mutual acceptance of certificates issued. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement affects in particular the validity of certificates and licenses originating from the United Kingdom issued under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. The Commission proposes therefore to set up a temporary mechanism, to extend the validity of certain aviation safety certificates, in order to allow the operators concerned and the Agency sufficient time to issue the necessary certificates under Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking account of the United Kingdom's status as a third country. CONTENT: the proposal aims to put in place a mechanism to temporarily extend (for 9 months) the validity of certain aviation safety certificates in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. It would thus allow post-Brexit EU-27 manufacturers to continue their production and operators to continue to use these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. This Regulation shall apply to the certificates listed in the Annex to this Regulation, which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by any of the following: - the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom as set out in Section 1 of the Annex; - natural or legal persons certified by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom as set out in Section 2 of the Annex. The Commission shall have the power to adopt delegated acts in order to extend the period of validity of the certificates referred to in Section 1 of the Annex to the Regulation. Lastly, the content and exams of certain trainings addressed under the proposal are regulated in a detailed manner under Union law and consist of standardised modules, which should normally be completed in one Member State, before a transfer to another Member State jurisdiction is possible."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. CONTENT: the present Commission proposal for a Council decision aims at formally concluding the compensatory agreements reached between the European Union and several WTO Members in order to obtain a consolidated GATS schedule of specific commitments covering all the Member States who were members of the European Union in 2006. The terms and conditions under which WTO Members commit access to their market to the services and service suppliers of other WTO Members are specified in their GATS schedules of specific commitments. The original schedule of specific commitments of the European Union and its Member States (‘the EU GATS schedule’) dates back to 1994, and only covers those twelve Member States who were members of the European Union at that time. The thirteen Member States that have joined the European Union in 1995 and 2004 continued to maintain their individual GATS schedules, which were adopted prior to their accession to the European Union. In order to ensure that those thirteen Member States did not maintain commitments which would be in breach of the acquis communautaire and that they were covered by the horizontal limitations included in the EU GATS schedule, it was necessary to notify the modification and withdrawal of certain specific commitments included in the EU GATS schedule and in the individual GATS schedules of the thirteen Member States concerned, and to consolidate those individual schedules with the EU GATS schedule. To this end, on 28 May 2004, the European Union notified to the WTO the modification and withdrawal of certain commitments included in the EU GATS schedule and in the GATS schedules of the thirteen Member States concerned. The European Union subsequently entered into negotiations with eighteen WTO Members, who claimed to be affected by these modifications and withdrawals, under Article XXI of GATS. In the course of such negotiations, in accordance with the Council Conclusions of 26 July 2006, the European Union agreed on the compensation to be offered to the affected WTO Members. The notified modifications and withdrawals, together with the agreed compensatory adjustments, were incorporated into a consolidated EU GATS schedule, the certification of which was concluded pursuant to the applicable WTO rules on 15 December 2006. Thereby, the European Union became the first member of the World Trade Organization that successfully used the GATS provisions on the modification and withdrawal of commitments. As a result of the successful consolidation of the EU GATS schedule, its services commitments could be presented in a single document covering its, at that time, twenty five Member States (hereafter ‘the EU25 consolidated schedule’). The agreed compensatory adjustments constituted a satisfactory and balanced outcome of the negotiations and should therefore be approved on behalf of the European Union. Accordingly, on 27 March 2007, the Commission submitted a proposal for a Council Decision on the conclusion of the Agreements. On 23 July 2007, the Council agreed on the text of a draft decision of the Council and of the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council approving the conclusion of the Agreements on behalf of the European Union and its Member States. On 11 October 2007 the Parliament, in a consultation procedure, approved the conclusion of the Agreements. At this stage, the Council has not yet approved the conclusion of the Agreements, which have not been ratified by all the Member States concerned. The fact that the Agreements have not yet been formally concluded is hindering the consolidation process of the EU GATS schedule regarding the Member States having joined the European Union after 2006, since the WTO Members who claimed to be affected by the modifications of the schedules of those Member States refuse to engage in this process until the legal status of the Agreements had been clarified."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this initiative is part of the third ‘Europe on the Move’ package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. Investment in transport infrastructure significantly contributes to achieving these objectives. In particular, the completion of the Trans-European Network for Transport (TEN-T) core network and its corridors is expected to generate an additional EUR 4.500 billion or 1.8% of EU GDP and account for 13 million job-years until 2030. Notwithstanding the necessity and binding timelines, experience has shown that many investments aiming to complete the TEN-T are confronted with complex permit granting procedures, cross-border procurement procedures and other procedures. This situation jeopardises the on time implementation of projects and in many cases results in significant delays and increased costs. In order to address these issues and make synchronised TEN-T completion possible,, harmonised action is necessary at Union level. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the policy options were based on increasing levels of intervention, ambition and ‘cumulative’ expected impact. The preferred option is that of a limited binding action to be decentralised and implemented at national level. The specific expected benefits should be as follows: time savings in the permit granting procedures; 5 billion in user cost savings; mobilisation, before 2025, of 84% of total investment in the TEN-T core network; 700 million and an estimated reduction in CO2 emissions of 2.686 thousand tonnes for the period 2018-2030; 150 million net savings for project promoters and public authorities. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks the effective and timely completion of TEN-T across the Union, by reducing the risk of delays and increasing the level of certainty for project promoters and investors as regards the length of the applicable procedures. Another objective is to facilitate the involvement of private investors and provide more clarity on public consultations. The main elements of the proposal are as follows: Priority status of projects of common interest : each project of common interest on the TEN-T core network shall be subject to an integrated permit granting procedure managed by a single competent authority designated by each Member State. Where priority status exists under national law, projects of common interest shall be granted the status with the highest national significance possible, and be treated as such in permit granting procedures, where and in the manner such treatment is provided for in national legislation applicable to the corresponding types of transport infrastructure. Integration of the permit granting procedures : the proposal requires that the authorisation of TEN-T projects is handled by one single authority that manages and takes ownership of the overall process and acts as the single entry point for project promoters and other investors. The proposal deals with the designation and role of such an authority and defines the procedural steps leading to a comprehensive decision authorising the investor to go ahead with the project. Permit granting procedures are be expected to last up to a maximum of three years which is a significant improvement in comparison to the current situation. Coordination : the proposal stresses the importance of coordinating permit granting procedures across borders and strengthens the role of the European Coordinators in monitoring the permit granting procedure. Public procurement : the proposal provides for the application of only one legal framework on public procurement for cross-border projects. Unless otherwise specified in an intergovernmental agreement, joint entities developing such projects will apply a single national legislation to procure works and services when implementing the project."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the first EU Directive on motor insurance was adopted in 1972, with the dual objectives of protecting victims of motor vehicle accidents (with or without a cross-border element), and facilitating the free movement of motor vehicles between Member States. Five motor insurance Directives since 1972 progressively strengthened the Directive and enhanced its provisions; they were consolidated into Directive 2009/103/EC of the European Parliament and the Council. Motor insurance also has an impact on the free movement of persons, goods and vehicles. It should therefore be a key objective of the Union action in the field of financial services to reinforce and consolidate the internal market for motor insurance. The evaluation of the functioning of Directive 2009/103/EC concluded that the Directive was working well overall. However, four areas have been identified where targeted amendments would be appropriate: (i) compensation of victims of accidents in cases of insolvency of an insurance undertaking, (ii) minimum obligatory amounts of insurance cover, (iii) checks by Member States on vehicle insurance and (iv) the use of policyholders’ claims history statements by a new insurance undertaking. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examined several options for each of the problems identified. The proposed amendments aim at reducing uninsured driving, potentially reducing motor insurance premiums, and at improving the level of protection of victims of motor accidents, potentially benefitting all citizens in the EU. The proposal avoids risking large potential increases of premiums of motor insurance. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Directive 2009/103/EC on motor insurance introduces the following changes: Scope : the proposal clarifies the scope of the Directive in the light of recent judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The Court of Justice of the European Union has clarified that motor vehicles are intended normally to serve as means of transport, irrespective of such vehicle's characteristics, and it has clarified that the use of such vehicles covers any use of a vehicle consistent with its normal function as a means of transport, irrespective of the terrain on which the motor vehicle is used and of whether it is stationary or in motion. Uninsured driving : Member States shall be authorised to carry out insurance checks of vehicles normally based in the territory of another Member State and of vehicles normally based in the territory of a third country entering their territory from the territory of another Member state only if, they are non-discriminatory necessary and proportionate, form part of a general system of checks on the national territory and do not require stopping of the vehicle for the purpose of such a check. Those checks have to be conducted in accordance with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data. Minimum level of protection : in order to ensure the same minimum level of protection at EU level for victims of motor vehicle accidents, the proposal harmonises at EU level the minimum levels of compulsory cover for personal injury and material damage, without prejudice to any higher amounts of cover prescribed by the Member States. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to update, every five years, the harmonised minimum amounts of cover for victims in line with inflation. Insolvency of the insurer : each Member State should entrust a body set up for this purpose with the task of providing compensation for material or personal injuries caused by a vehicle insured by an undertaking which is insolvent or where, after a period of three months from the date on which the injured party submitted a claim for compensation, the insurer has not provided a reasoned reply. The injured parties would be compensated by the body in their Member State of residence. That body would be entitled to claim reimbursement from the body in the Member State where the insurance undertaking which produced the contract is established, with the latter assuming ultimate responsibility.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since 1990, programmes under the 'European territorial cooperation' objective, better known as 'Interreg', have supported cross-border cooperation programmes in EU border regions, including those with EFTA countries. Thousands of projects and initiatives that have helped to improve European integration have been funded. In recent decades, the European integration process has helped internal border regions to transform themselves from mainly peripheral areas into areas of growth and opportunities. However, the evidence gathered by the Commission shows that, in general, border regions generally perform less well economically than other regions within a Member State. Access to public services such as hospitals and universities is generally lower in border regions. Navigating between different administrative and legal systems is often still complex and costly. These programmes alone can hardly compensate for these differences. In its Communication of 20 September 2017 on EU border regions, the Commission highlighted ways in which the EU and its Member States can reduce the complexity, length and costs of cross-border interaction and promoted the pooling of services along internal borders. In 2015, the Luxembourg Presidency and several Member States studied the possibility of creating a new instrument to simplify cross-border projects by making it possible, on a voluntary basis and agreed by the competent authorities in charge, for the rules of one Member State to apply in the neighbouring Member State. This would apply to a specific project or action limited in time, located within a border region and initiated by local and/or regional public authorities. The Commission supports this idea and therefore proposes a voluntary mechanism to address legal obstacles in border regions. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Commission considers that a voluntary mechanism to remove legal and administrative obstacles in all border regions would provide a cost-free legal framework in order to reduce the costs and time to complete certain cross-border projects. If 20% of existing legal and administrative obstacles found along internal borders were addressed, border regions would increase their GDP by 2%. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation sets up a mechanism to allow for the application in one Member State, with regard to a cross-border region, of the legal provisions from another Member State, where the application of the legal provisions of the former would constitute a legal obstacle hampering the implementation of a joint project. Characteristics of the mechanism : the mechanism shall consist of the conclusion of a European Cross-border Commitment, which is self-executing, or a European Cross-border Statement which requires a further legislative procedure in the Member State. The mechanism shall: remain voluntary : Member States may opt for the mechanism or use other effective mechanisms to resolve legal border barriers; focus on intra-EU land borders , while allowing Member States to also apply the mechanism to maritime and external borders; cover joint projects for any item of infrastructure with impact in a cross-border region or any service of general economic interest provided in a cross-border region. Member States opting for the Mechanism set up under the proposed Regulation are obliged to establish a national or, in the case of federal states, regional Cross-border Coordination Points. Procedure : the procedure for concluding a commitment or statement consists in: the preparation and submission of the initiative document, to be drafted by the ‘initiator’ (for example, the public or private body responsible for initiating or both initiating and implementing a joint project or one or more local or regional authority located in a given cross-border region or exercising public power in that cross-border region; a preliminary analysis by the Member State which is requested to ‘pull over the border’ the legal provisions of the neighbouring Member State; the drafting of the Commitment or Statement to be concluded; and finally the conclusion of the Commitment or Statement and its signing by the competent authorities of both Member States. Implementation : the Commitment is implemented by, where relevant, amending existing administrative acts based on the ‘normally’ applicable law or adopting new administrative acts based on the law ‘pulled over the border’. The Statement must be implemented by one or more submissions of proposals to the competent legislative body in order to amend the national law to cover the necessary derogations. In both cases, once all steps planned are implemented, the Cross-border Coordination Point must inform its counterpart in the other Member State and the EU coordination point."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services revealed that operators in national markets are facing obstacles to the development of inter-urban coach services. An ex-post evaluation of the Regulation was carried out from 2015 to 2017 and concluded that the Regulation is only partly effective in achieving its original objective of promoting coach and bus services as a sustainable alternative to individual car transport. By pursuing the opening of national markets, the proposal is part of the second mobility package, which aims to combat climate change, make European industry more competitive and improve the quality of life and choice of citizens for their daily mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the combination of measures selected would make it possible to: generate administrative savings for businesses and administrations in the range of EUR 1.560 million for the EU-28 over the assessment period (2015-2035); increase the activity of coach transport by more than 11 % in 2030 relative to the baseline and increase its modal share by almost one percentage point; improve the connectivity of disadvantaged social groups by 62 billion passenger-kilometres in 2030 while creating 85 000 new jobs and contribute to lower accident costs of EUR 2.8 billion for the EU-28 over the assessment period; have a positive impact on the environment with a EUR 183 million net cumulative savings in CO2 emissions costs and net cumulative savings in air pollution costs of EUR 590 million for the EU-28; This would not undermine the sustainability of public service contracts serving remote urban areas. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend the Regulation on passenger coach services with a view to granting access to national markets for regular services. It provides in particular for the following: Scope : the proposal extends the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 to all inter-urban carriage of passengers by regular services. Non-resident carriers should be able to operate national regular services under the same conditions as resident carriers. Regulatory body : each Member State is required to designate an independent and impartial regulatory body. The objective of that requirement is to avoid any conflicts of interest when a regulatory body is conducting an economic analysis to determine if economic equilibrium of a public service contract is compromised. The body should be able to obtain the information requested and enforce its decisions by means of appropriate penalties. Right of access to terminals : carriers should enjoy a right of access to terminals on fair, equitable, non-discriminatory and transparent terms for the purpose of operating regular services. Applications for access should only be refused if there is a lack of capacity in the terminal. Decisions on applications for access are to be taken within two months and shall contain a proper statement of reasons. Carriers shall have the possibility to appeal decisions to the Regulatory body. Regular services subject to authorisation : the proposal establishes: an authorising procedure for the international carriage of passengers over a distance of less than 100 kilometres as the crow flies : authorisations shall be granted unless rejection is justified under the clearly specified; an authorising procedure for the international carriage of passengers over a distance 100 kilometres or more as the crow flies : the refusal of a new service cannot be justified on the grounds that it compromises the economic equilibrium of a public service contract; an authorisation procedure for national regular services : the authorisation for a new service carrying passengers over distance of less than 100 kilometres as the crow flies can be rejected if it compromises the economic equilibrium of a public service contract. In addition, the proposal: abolishes the use of the journey form as a control document for occasional services. This should eliminate an unnecessary administrative burden; deletes the obligation according to which regular services are to be performed as part of a regular international service as well as the prohibition of cabotage operations in the form of regular services being carried out independent of a regular service; puts an end to the obligation to establish cabotage journey forms for occasional services; amends rules relating to inspections on the road and in undertakings to include cabotage operations. Lastly, reporting requirements are foreseen so that the Commission can have consistent information from all Member States to enable it to monitor and evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the legislation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the Union pursuant to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. Consequently, unless another date is established in a withdrawal agreement, or the European Council, in agreement with the United Kingdom, unanimously establishes another date, Union law will cease to apply to the United Kingdom from 30 March 2019. The United Kingdom will then become a third country. CONTENT: this proposal for a Decision of the European Parliament and the Council adapting Directive 2012/27/EU [as amended by Directive 2018/XXX/EU] on energy efficiency and the Regulation (EU) 2018/XXX [Governance of the Energy Union] is necessitated by the upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In this regard, it is necessary to technically adapt the projected energy consumption figures for the European Union in 2030 to reflect the Union of 27 Member States. Projections made for the at least 32.5 % Union headline target show that primary energy consumption should equal 1 273 million tonnes of oil equivalent (Mtoe) and 956 Mtoe of final energy consumption in 2030 for the Union of 28 Member States. The equivalent projections for the EU 27 excluding the United Kingdom show that primary energy consumption should equal 1 128 Mtoe and final energy consumption should equal 846 Mtoe in 2030. This requires the adaptation of the figures for energy consumption levels in 2030. Lastly, Member States shall take into account the projections for the EU27 when notifying the Commission of national indicative energy efficiency contributions towards the EU target for 2030 as part of their integrated national energy and climate plans."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: total freight transport in the EU has increased by almost 25 % over the last 20 years, and is projected to further increase by 51 % during 2015-2050. All this movement of goods is accompanied by a large amount of information being exchanged among a variety of parties, in both the private and the public domain. Today, this information is mostly printed on paper, in a variety of standard format documents. The fragmented legislation and the resulting lack of acceptance by authorities discourage investment in digital solutions for electronic documents. Yet the digitalisation of information exchange has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of transport and therefore to contribute to the smooth functioning of the single market. The Commission has acknowledged the need to foster acceptance and use of electronic transport documents in a number of policy initiative. The case for intervention has also been recognised by a wide range of stakeholders. This initiative is part of the third ‘Europe on the Move’ Package, which delivers on the new industrial policy strategy of September 2017, and is designed to complete the process of enabling Europe to reap the full benefits of the modernisation of mobility. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a full obligation for Member State authorities to accept regulatory cargo transport information or documentation, with partially harmonised implementation. The main expected benefits are of an economic and environmental nature. The industry is expected to make savings worth EUR 20-27 billion over 2018-2040, compared to a scenario where no policy intervention at EU level is made (the baseline), thanks to reduction in administrative costs (i.e. costs related to the management and exchange of transport information and documentation). This is equivalent to 75-102 million hours saved yearly. Road transport operators, 99% of which are SMEs, are expected to benefit of about 60% of all industry administrative costs savings. Positive environmental impacts are also expected, due to a decrease in road transport’s modal share in 2030 relative to the baseline. CONTENT: this proposal for a Regulation contains measures to: ensure that the obligation for all competent public authorities to accept electronic freight documents/information is in place in all EU Member States; ensure that the authorities implement the obligation of acceptance in a uniform manner; ensure the interoperability of the IT systems and solutions used for the electronic exchange of freight transport information, and in particular for business-to-administration (B2A) regulatory information communication. Concretely, the proposal: lays down requirements relative to the electronic format in which regulatory transport information (eFTI) should be made available by the economic operators concerned; establishes the obligation of the Member States’ competent authorities of regulatory information made available electronically by the economic operators concerned in compliance with the conditions provided that such information meets the requirements guaranteeing its authenticity, integrity, security, etc; requires the competent authorities, eFTI services providers and economic operators concerned to take measures to ensure the confidentiality of the information processed and exchanged in accordance with this Regulation; establishes the obligation of the Commission to adopt implementing acts establishing a common data set and subsets in relation the regulatory requirements under the scope of this Regulation, and laying down common procedures and rules for access to and processing by the competent authorities of regulatory information provided electronically; sets out the functional requirements for the eFTI platforms by the means of which the regulatory information could be made available by the economic operators concerned, and empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts laying detailed rules for their implementation. The proposal contains provisions on powers delegated to the Commission to amend non-essential elements in Annex 1 to this Regulation, where the regulatory information requirements falling under the scope of this Regulation are listed."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (Convention 108) is the only legally binding multilateral agreement in the field of personal data protection. Convention 108 requires the Parties to incorporate into their respective national laws the necessary measures to ensure respect for the human right of all individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. At present, 51 States have ratified Convention 108, including all 28 EU Member States. Convention 108 was opened for signature in 1981, long before the era of the internet and electronic communications. The development of technology and globalisation of information poses new challenges in the field of protection of personal information. On 31 May 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to participate on behalf of the Union in the negotiations on the modernisation of the Council of Europe Convention for the protection of individuals with regard to automatic processing of personal data (EST 108) and the conditions and modalities of accession of the Union to the modernised Convention. The Protocol amending Convention 108 (the amending Protocol) was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 18 May 2018 and will be open for signature as of 25 June 2018. The amending Protocol aims to widen the scope, increase the level and improve the effectiveness of data protection afforded under Convention 108. Given that the Union cannot sign or ratify the amending Protocol, as under the current Convention 108 only States are Parties, Member States should therefore be authorised to ratify the amending Protocol, acting jointly in the interests of the Union.

BACKGROUND: the European Union is built on solidarity, a shared value which is strongly felt throughout European society. There are many young people who want to engage in solidarity activities, and there are many unmet needs in communities that could be addressed by involving young people in such activities. The State of the Union address of 14 September 2016 emphasised the need to invest in young people and announced the establishment of a European Solidarity Corps with a view to creating opportunities for young people across the Union to make a meaningful contribution to society, show solidarity and develop their skills. In its communication of 7 December 2016, the Commission launched the first phase of the Corps and reiterated the target of having 100 000 young Europeans taking part in it by 2020. During this initial phase, eight different EU programmes were mobilised to offer volunteering, traineeship or job opportunities to young people across the EU. As there is potential to further develop solidarity with victims of crises and disasters in non-EU countries, this proposal provides for extending the scope of the European Solidarity Corps to include support to humanitarian aid operations in non-EU countries, including those located in the EU outermost regions' neighbourhood. The new programme shall allow at least 350 000 young Europeans to support communities in need between 2021 and 2027 through volunteering, traineeships and job placements. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European solidarity corps under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. The regulation on the European solidarity corps shall be repealed with effect from 1 January 2021. The European solidarity corps aims to strengthen the engagement of young people and organisations in accessible and high-quality solidarity activities. It is a means to strengthen cohesion, solidarity and democracy in Europe and abroad and to address societal and humanitarian challenges on the ground, with a particular focus on promoting social inclusion. It shall enable participants to strengthen and validate their skills and facilitate their integration into the labour market. The programme shall offer activities that can be undertaken in a country other than the country of residence of the participants (cross-border activities and volunteering in support of humanitarian aid) and activities that can be undertaken in their country of residence (in-country). The programme shall be implemented under two strands of action: Strand 1: participation of young people in solidarity activities addressing societal challenges : the actions shall contribute in particular to strengthening cohesion, solidarity and democracy in the EU and beyond, while addressing societal challenges, with particular efforts to promote social inclusion; Strand 2: participation of young people in humanitarian aid related solidarity activities (European Voluntary Humanitarian Aid Corps) : these actions shall contribute in particular to providing needs-based humanitarian aid, aimed at preserving lives, preventing and alleviating human suffering and maintaining human dignity, as well as strengthening the capacities and resilience of vulnerable or disaster-stricken communities. Supported actions : the European solidarity corps shall provide young people with easily accessible opportunities to engage in volunteering, traineeships or jobs in solidarity-related sectors, such as the social economy, and to devise and develop solidarity projects at their own initiative. It shall also support networking activities for its participants and organisations. Participation : the European solidarity corps targets young people aged 18-30, and participation in the activities offered by the European solidarity corps shall require prior registration in the European solidarity corps portal. Any public or private entity established in a participating country as well as international organisations may apply for funding under the European solidarity corps. A quality label shall be obtained by the participating organisation as a pre-condition for receiving funding under the European solidarity corps. Special attention shall be given to ensuring that the activities supported by the European solidarity corps are accessible to all young people, notably the most disadvantaged ones. Special measures shall be put in place to promote social inclusion, the participation of disadvantaged young people, as well as to take into account the constraints imposed by the remoteness of a number of rural areas and of the outermost regions of the Union and the Overseas Countries and Territories. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission’s proposal for the multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 1.26 billion at current prices for the period 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 provides for ‘Union General export authorisations’ which facilitate controls on low-risk exports of dual-use items to certain third countries. Currently, Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, including Liechtenstein, and the United States of America are covered by Union General export authorisation No. EU001. In the absence of a withdrawal agreement, all EU legislation on the import and export of goods shall apply to goods moving between the EU and the United Kingdom. Considering that the United Kingdom is an important destination for dual-use items produced in the Union, it is appropriate to add the United Kingdom to the list of destinations covered by the Union General export authorisations No. EU001 in order to ensure a uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union, to promote a level playing field for Union exporters and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden, while protecting Union and international security. The Commission recalls that the United Kingdom is a party to relevant international treaties and a member of international non-proliferation regimes and that it maintains full compliance with related obligations and commitments, and applies proportionate and adequate controls to effectively address considerations about intended end use and the risk of diversion consistent with the provisions. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 aims to add the United Kingdom to the list of destinations covered by the Union General export authorisation for dual-use items only in a situation where no withdrawal agreement is concluded with the United Kingdom. Given the urgency entailed by the circumstances of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union, it is necessary to allow for a prompt application of the provisions provided for in this Regulation, i.e. on the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The withdrawal shall occur during the programming period 2014-2020 in which the United Kingdom is participating in fifteen programmes under the European territorial cooperation goal ('cooperation programmes'). Two of those programmes are programmes involving Northern Ireland and supporting peace and reconciliation and North-South cooperation under the ‘Good Friday Agreement’ that the Union intends to continue even if the United Kingdom withdraws from the Union without a withdrawal agreement having entered into force by the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. CONTENT: this proposal aims to ensure the continuation of two bilateral cooperation programmes involving Ireland namely: (i) the PEACE IV (Ireland-United Kingdom) programme and; (ii) the United Kingdom-Ireland (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland) programme. Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013 shall continue to apply to the cooperation programmes subject to the provisions of this Regulation. By way of derogation from Regulation (EU) No 1299/2013: - the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB) hosting the managing authority and the certifying authority of the PEACE IV (Ireland-United Kingdom) and the United Kingdom - Ireland (Ireland-Northern Ireland-Scotland) Programmes shall continue to exercise its functions; - the Department of Finance of Northern Ireland shall remain the audit authority of these programmes. The Regulation shall apply from the date following the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. It shall not apply if a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposed Regulation has no financial implications. Both programmes shall continue to be financed from the Union’s budget. The possibility to execute the necessary controls and audits in all participating regions will need to be confirmed by an agreement between the Commission and the authorities of the United Kingdom and will constitute a condition for financing."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Erasmus+ programme supports actions in the fields of education and training, youth and sport. Every year, it provides nearly 800 000 people the opportunity to benefit from learning or training abroad. Mobility activities can last up to 12 months. The Commission estimates that by the time the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland withdraws from the European Union, there will be almost 14 000 learners from EU-27 post-Brexit (students and trainees in higher education and vocational education and training, young learners, educational staff) in the United Kingdom and some 7 000 learners from the United Kingdom within EU-27 post-Brexit. In the absence of an agreement, the current participants would not be able to complete their Erasmus+ semester, and may no longer benefit from scholarships. Many students would lose their university credits and be forced to repeat their semester or academic year, which would have a disruptive effect both on the students themselves and on their home and host institutions. Urgent measures are needed to avoid disruption of mobility activities for education and training purposes under Erasmus+ in which the United Kingdom participates at the time of its withdrawal from the European Union. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation ensures that, in the absence of a withdrawal agreement, young people from the European Union and the United Kingdom participating in the Erasmus+ programme as of 30 March 2019 shall be able to complete their stay without interruption, complete their studies and continue to receive the corresponding funding or grants. For the purposes of the continuation of financing of ongoing learning mobility activities from the Union budget, the Commission and the United Kingdom should agree to allow the exercise of controls and audits of the respective activities. If the necessary controls and audits cannot be carried out, this should be considered a serious deficiency in the management and control system. This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 13 December 2018, the European Council (Article 50) renewed its call to intensify work on preparing, at all levels, for the consequences of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the Union, taking into account all possible outcomes. In response to this call, this Regulation is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission in view of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom regarding the ratification of the withdrawal agreement. The principal objective of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and the Council is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of aviation safety in the Union. For that purpose, a system of certificates has been established for various aviation activities, in order to achieve the required safety levels and to enable the necessary verifications and the mutual acceptance of certificates issued. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement affects in particular the validity of certificates and licenses originating from the United Kingdom issued under Regulation (EU) 2018/1139. The Commission proposes therefore to set up a temporary mechanism, to extend the validity of certain aviation safety certificates, in order to allow the operators concerned and the Agency sufficient time to issue the necessary certificates under Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, taking account of the United Kingdom's status as a third country. CONTENT: the proposal aims to put in place a mechanism to temporarily extend (for 9 months) the validity of certain aviation safety certificates in the absence of an agreement to withdraw the United Kingdom from the Union. It would thus allow post-Brexit EU-27 manufacturers to continue their production and operators to continue to use these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. This Regulation shall apply to the certificates listed in the Annex to this Regulation, which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by any of the following: - the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom as set out in Section 1 of the Annex; - natural or legal persons certified by the competent authorities of the United Kingdom as set out in Section 2 of the Annex. The Commission shall have the power to adopt delegated acts in order to extend the period of validity of the certificates referred to in Section 1 of the Annex to the Regulation. Lastly, the content and exams of certain trainings addressed under the proposal are regulated in a detailed manner under Union law and consist of standardised modules, which should normally be completed in one Member State, before a transfer to another Member State jurisdiction is possible."

BACKGROUND: in July 2011, the Foreign Affairs Council1 expressed its willingness to negotiate an agreement with Afghanistan that would reflect its long-term commitment to the country’s development. In November 2011, the Council adopted a Decision authorising the Commission and the High Representative to negotiate a Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development (CAPD) with Afghanistan After three rounds of negotiations that went on until November 2012, talks were resumed in 2015, with the new Afghan Government. The fourth and final round of negotiations took place in Brussels on 29 April 2015 and was concluded successfully. The two sides initialled the Agreement in Kabul on 2 July 2015.

The two parties are committed to pursuing and extending their cooperation, to strengthening existing links and to establishing a close and lasting relationship based on reciprocity and mutual interests. The Agreement includes provisions on political dialogue and on cooperation in a broad range of areas.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council can adopt the act only if the European Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND : Regulation (EU) No 1077/2011 established the European Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, (eu-LISA), in order to ensure the operational management of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II), the VISA Information System (VIS) and Eurodac and potentially of the preparation, development and operational management of other large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. Since 29 December 2017 and the entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2017/2226, the Agency became responsible for the development and operational management of the Entry/Exit System (EES). The participation of associate countries in the Agency's work is a necessary step having regard to their association to the Schengen acquis and to Dublin and Eurodac-related measures and to their participation in the large-scale IT systems operated by the Agency. On 24 July 2012, the Commission received the Council authorisation to open negotiations with Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein on an arrangement on the modalities of these countries' participation in the Agency. The final text of the draft arrangement was initialled on 15 June 2018. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council conclude the Arrangement between the European Union and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein on the participation of those States in the Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The draft arrangement provides for: The draft arrangement also sets out: Lastly, the draft arrangement contains provisions on combatting, dispute settlement, entry into force and validity and termination.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: during the refugee crisis of 2015 and 2016, the EU budget has played a decisive role in managing flows of asylum seekers and migrants. The European migration agenda adopted in May 2015 stressed the need for a consistent common policy to restore confidence in the Union’s ability to combine European and national efforts to address migration issues. In October 2017, the European Council reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive approach to managing migration flows, aimed at restoring control of external borders and reducing irregular arrivals and deaths at sea. Drawing on the lessons from the past, the Commission, in its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027, proposed to significantly increase the share of the overall EU budget devoted to migration and external border management by more than 2.6 times, including an increase in the funding allocated to decentralised bodies in this policy area. The renewed Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF) shall build on the results and investments made with the support of previous funds: the European Refugee Fund, the European Fund for the Integration of Third Country Nationals, the European Return Fund, and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) for the period 2014-2020. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the asylum and migration fund for the period 2021-2027. Its scope is largely inspired by the current AMIF Regulation, while taking into account new strategic developments and the mandates of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and the future European Union Agency for Asylum. The Fund shall continue to support the EU's overall policies in the field of migration, integration and return, such as support to: strengthen and develop the Common European Asylum System (including its external dimension); promote solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States, in particular towards those States most affected by flows of migrants and asylum seekers; support legal migration to Member States and encourage the development of immigration strategies that respect the integration process of third-country nationals; support capacity building in Member States and promote fair and effective return strategies as well as the development of partnerships and cooperation with third countries. Support to Member States : in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key reflecting the needs and pressures experienced by Member States in the area of integration. It is proposed to give 30% weighting to the area of asylum, 30% to the area of legal migration and integration and 40% to the area of countering irregular migration including returns. The Commission shall carry out a mid-term and a retrospective evaluation of this Regulation, including the actions implemented under the fund. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % should be managed through a thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for the support for specific actions, providing additional funding for dedicated actions of high EU added value. Specific attention shall be put on promoting effective returns; support for resettlement and the solidarity and responsibility efforts between the Member States. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the fund for the period 2021-2027 shall be EUR 10.41 billion in current prices. The financial resources shall be used as follows: EUR 4.16 billion for the thematic mechanism for specific actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension, and to address urgent needs. It should be noted that the Commission proposal concerning the multiannual financial framework provides for EUR 865 million (in current prices) to the relevant decentralised agencies for the period 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: effective protection of the EU's external borders is an essential precondition for managing migration flows and ensuring internal security. Strong external borders are also what allow the EU to maintain a Schengen area without internal border controls. Financial support from the Union budget is essential for the implementation of integrated European border management as implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard, set up by Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In order to respond to increased migratory and security challenges, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a new integrated border management fund under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. This new fund aims to provide enhanced support to Member States with a view to securing the Union’s common external borders, with an envelope of EUR 9.31 billion (in current prices). A five-fold increase as compared to the current multiannual financial framework for the overall envelope for border management is foreseen for the next period. Within that framework, the proposed integrated border management fund shall be composed of two instruments: an instrument for financial support for border management and visa and an instrument for financial support for customs control equipment. This proposal concerns only the instrument for border management and visa. A separate proposal covering the instrument for customs control equipment is presented by the Commission in parallel. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the instrument for financial support for border management and visa as part of the integrated border management fund. It lays down the objectives of the instrument, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Objective : the instrument shall ensure strong and effective European integrated border management at the external borders while safeguarding the free movement of persons within it, in full compliance with the Union’s commitments on fundamental rights, thereby contributing to guaranteeing a high level of security in the Union. Its specific objectives are to: support effective European integrated border management at the external borders implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard as a shared responsibility of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and of the national authorities responsible for border management, to facilitate legitimate border crossings, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and cross-border crime and to effectively manage migratory flows; support the common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel and prevent migratory and security risks: the instrument shall contribute to the improvement of the efficiency of visa processing in terms of detecting and assessing security and irregular migration risks, as well as facilitating visa procedures for bona fide travellers. In particular, the instrument shall deliver financial assistance to support digitalisation of visa processing with the objective to provide fast, secure and client-friendly visa procedures for the benefit of both visa applicants and consulates. Priority shall be given to supporting actions with a European dimension. Support to Member States : in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million that is envisaged to be allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key that shall reflect the needs and pressure experienced by Member States in the two areas covered by this instrument (border management and visas). Funding shall be distributed based on the following weighing: 30% for external land borders, 35% for external sea borders, 20% for airports and 15% for consular offices. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for a number of priorities defined in Commission financing decisions. The instrument shall furthermore maintain support for the functioning of the Special Transit Scheme implemented by Lithuania, in line with the EU’s obligations, compensating Lithuania for the transit visa fees it foregoes and additional costs it incurs as a result of the facilitated transit document (FTD) and facilitated rail transit document (FRTD) scheme, such as the costs of replacing and upgrading equipment and IT systems, and training and operational costs. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 8.01 billion (in current prices) for the instrument for border management and visa for the 2021-2027 period. Implementation shall be by means of shared, direct or indirect management. The global resources shall be allocated as follows: EUR 4.81 billion (around 60%) for measures taken by Member States in border management and visa policy, including EUR 157.2 million for the special transit scheme applied by Lithuania; EUR 3.20 billion (40%) for the thematic facility for targeted support actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension and urgent needs."

Regulation BACKGROUND: over recent years, security threats have intensified and diversified in Europe. Terrorism, serious and organised crime, itinerant crime, drug trafficking, corruption, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and arms, among others, continue to challenge the internal security of the Union. The challenges the Union is facing, notably from international terrorism, cannot be managed by individual Member States alone and without the financial and technical support of the EU. Security has an inherently cross-border dimension and therefore a strong, coordinated Union response is required. Financial support provided under this Regulation shall contribute in particular to strengthening national and Union capabilities in the security area. The Commission proposes to multiply EU funding for internal security by factor of 1.8 compared to the current period (2014-2020), so as to ensure a high level of security within the Union while strengthening the role of decentralised agencies in this area. The new internal security fund builds on the investments and achievements of its predecessor instruments: (i) the security and safeguarding liberties programme; (ii) the instrument for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management (ISF-P) and (iii) the drugs component of the Justice programme. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The proposed scope builds largely on the current Regulation for the Internal Security Fund-Police, while taking into account new policy developments, such as the European security agenda, the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime, and the new interoperability agenda. Objectives : the new enhanced fund shall contribute to a high level of security in the Union, in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime. Its specific objectives shall be to: increase the exchange of information among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; intensify cross-border joint operations among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities in relation to serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; support effort at strengthening the capabilities in relation to combating and preventing crime including terrorism in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the Member States. Actions funded shall be implemented in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. Actions limited to maintaining public order at national level shall not be eligible. Member State support : the allocation of the funding to the programmes of the Member States shall be based on a distribution key of three criteria: (i) the gross domestic product; (ii) size of the territory and; (iii) population of the state. It is proposed to weigh the different criteria as follows: 45% to inverse proportion to the gross domestic product, 40% to proportion to the size of population and 15% to proportion to the size of the territory of the Member State. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for projects with real European added value or to meet urgent needs and emergency funding to Member States. Coordination between EU policies : the enhanced ISF shall be coherent with and complementary to other Union financial programmes, notably the cohesion policy funds and Horizon Europe, as well as the Integrated Border Management Fund and the Asylum and Migration Fund. Furthermore, work under the internal security fund shall be consistent with that of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The Commission proposes to allocate an amount of EUR 1.12 billion (in current prices) to EU agencies in the field of security. The proposed Regulation does not cover the funding for these agencies. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 2.5 billion (in current prices) to the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The financial envelope shall be used as follows: EUR 1.5 billion allocated to Member States to enable them to build long-term resilience in the field of security; EUR 1 billion allocated to the thematic mechanism to address unforeseen security challenges and to enable a rapid response to emergency situations."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. The Commission has consistently made clear that protecting Union citizens in the United Kingdom, as well as United Kingdom nationals in the European Union is a priority. This will require Member States to take a generous approach to the United Kingdom nationals who are already resident in their territory. The expectation is that the United Kingdom acts in the same manner. As of the withdrawal date, in the event there is no withdrawal agreement concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom, Union law on social security coordination will no longer apply in the relations between the Union and the United Kingdom. This means that social security entitlements will not be guaranteed for Union citizens who are, or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States and in situations involving the United Kingdom (e.g. they worked or resided there while the United Kingdom was a Member State of the Union) and also of the United Kingdom nationals who are or have been subject to the legislation of one or more Member States. This proposal is necessary to protect the social security entitlements of the persons concerned with regard to facts or events occurring and periods completed before the date of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union in order to mitigate the risks associated with the so-called 'no deal' scenario. CONTENT: the proposal aims at ensuring that persons who have exercised, as Union citizens, their right to freedom of movement before the withdrawal date maintain their social security entitlements related to facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. Other relevant persons in situations involving the United Kingdom before the withdrawal date, should also maintain those entitlements: stateless persons, refugees, as well as family members and survivors of all the previous categories. Certain core principles of social security coordination as enshrined in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 on the coordination of social security systems (assimilation, aggregation, equality of treatment), as well as rules of this Regulation which give practical effect to the implementation of those principles (such as the pro-rata calculation of an old-age pension), should continue to apply in respect of those persons, as regards facts or events that occurred and periods completed before the withdrawal date. The proposal does not concern rights accrued after 29 March 2019, nor the exportability of cash benefits, the continued provision of sickness benefits in kind and the rules on applicable legislation. This Regulation shall apply as from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. When the Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply to the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom waters (12 nautical miles territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will no longer be part of the Union waters. Consequently, in case of a disorderly withdrawal, Union vessels risk losing access to these waters and fishing opportunities therein as of 30 March 2019. This would have significant impact in terms of fishing activities of the Union fleet and economic returns. The overall dependency of 8 Member States on United Kingdom waters averages 14 % of their overall landings, ranging from 50 % for the Belgium fleet to around 1 % for Spain. At the local community level the socio-economic impact can be significant, where fishing vessels are particularly dependent on access to United Kingdom waters. The fisheries sector also links up to ancillary activities upstream and downstream. Measures are already available under Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council8 that can be used for mitigating the adverse economic effects due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union throughout the whole chain of production and marketing. Under shared management, Member States affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union may decide to redirect available appropriations to any necessary measure mitigating its consequences. However, this discretion is currently limited to some priorities. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 lays down the rules and arrangements for granting financial compensation to fishermen and owners of fishing vessels in cases of temporary cessation of fishing activities. The criteria to allow for temporary cessation do not allow for compensation due to the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union and the subsequent loss of access to and fishing opportunities within the waters of that State. In addition to the measures already available under Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, the adverse economic effects caused by the withdrawal of a Member State from the Union, public support for the temporary cessation of fishing activities should be available for fishermen and operators that have significant dependence on access to United Kingdom waters. CONTENT: the proposed act would amend Union Regulation (EU) No 508/2014, so as to provide financial mitigation measures Union vessels impacted by a possible closure of the United Kingdom waters due to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to allow fishermen and operators from EU Member States to receive compensation from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and apply from the date following the date on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom and its territory. Alongside this measure to amend the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the Commission is proposing a measure on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposed modification does not imply any changes in the multiannual financial framework, annual ceilings, or for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The proposal consists of the frontloading of payment appropriations and is budgetary-neutral over the programming period."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a withdrawal agreement was concluded between the Union and the United Kingdom and endorsed by the European Council (Article 50) on 25 November 2018. However, its ratification in the United Kingdom is uncertain. This proposal is part of a package of emergency measures proposed by the Commission to deal with a possible withdrawal from the European Union without the United Kingdom's agreement. When the Common Fisheries Policy ceases to apply to the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will no longer be part of the Union waters. Consequently, in case of a disorderly withdrawal, Union and United Kingdom vessels risk not having the possibility to utilise fully the fishing opportunities as established for 2019. To guarantee the sustainability of fisheries and in light of the importance of fisheries for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is important to keep open the possibility of arrangements for continued reciprocal fishing access by Union and United Kingdom vessels to each other’s waters, for a limited period of time, after the withdrawal date. On 17 and 18 December 2018, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council fixed the fisheries opportunities for 2019. Based on this, the Commission has concluded that two contingency measures are necessary for the fisheries sector in order to mitigate the significant impacts on the fisheries sector of a withdrawal from the United Kingdom without a withdrawal agreement. Alongside this measure on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets, the Commission is proposing a measure to amend the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. CONTENT: the proposal shall amend Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, so as to provide a legal basis in Union law providing for the possibility for United Kingdom vessels to carry out fishing activities in Union waters and for introducing simplified and more efficient authorisation procedures for vessels wishing to fish in United Kingdom waters. In doing so major disruptions and delays in the authorisation procedures will be avoided. The proposed Regulation also continues the practice of exchanging quotas with the United Kingdom, as was the case when the United Kingdom joined the Union (approximately 1 000 quota exchanges take place each year between the United Kingdom and the Member States). The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ‘reciprocity’, i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends the current access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters. Consequently, authorisations will only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them in accordance with the fishing opportunity Regulations. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following that on which Union law ceases to apply to the United Kingdom pursuant to Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cybersecurity is an issue of common interest of the Union. Future security depends, among others, on enhancing technological and industrial ability to protect the Union against cyber threats, as both civilian infrastructure and military capacities rely on secure digital systems. Following the 2013 cybersecurity strategy, the Union has continued to increase its activities to meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity: in 2016, the Union adopted its first measures in the area of cybersecurity through Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on security of network and information systems; the creation in 2016 of the Public-Private Partnership (‘cPPP’) on cybersecurity in the Union was a solid first step bringing together the research, industry and public sector communities to facilitate research and innovation in cybersecurity and within the limits of the 2014-2020 financial framework should result in good, more focused outcomes in research and innovation. It will have triggered up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment by 2020; in September 2017, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy presented a joint Communication on ‘Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU’ to further reinforce the Union’s resilience, deterrence and response to cyber-attacks; at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017, Heads of State and Government called on the Union to become a global leader in the field of cybersecurity by 2025. With more than 660 cyber security competence centres throughout the EU, the EU already has considerable expertise in this area. However, the efforts of the research and industry communities are fragmented, lacking alignment and a common mission, which hinders the EU's competitiveness in this field. The Commission considers that these efforts and expertise need to be pooled, networked and used in an efficient manner to reinforce and complement existing research, technology and industrial capacities at Union and national levels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the main arguments in favour of the selected option were: the ability to create a real cybersecurity industrial policy by supporting activities related not only to research and development but also to market deployment; the flexibility to allow different cooperation models with the community and the network of competence centres to optimise the use of existing knowledge and resources; the ability to structure cooperation of the public and private stakeholders coming from all relevant sectors, including defence. CONTENT: this Regulation proposes to establish the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, as well as the Network of National Coordination Centres, and lays down rules for the nomination of National Coordination Centres as well as for the establishment of the Cybersecurity Competence Community. The Competence Centre : its role would be to facilitate the work of the Network of National Coordination Centres and to enhance the cybersecurity competences, by driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating access to the expertise so gathered. To this end, it would coordinate the use of cybersecurity funds under the EU's next long-term budget for the period 2021-2027 under the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. Its objectives would be: · to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, knowledge and infrastructures at the service of industries, the public sector and research communities; · to contribute to the wide deployment of the latest cyber security products and solutions across the economy; · to improve the understanding of cybersecurity and contribute to reducing skills gaps in the Union related to cybersecurity; · to contribute to the reinforcement of cybersecurity research and development in the Union; · to enhance synergies between the civilian and defence dimensions of cybersecurity. The Competence Centre would be set up as a European partnership to facilitate joint investment by the Union, Member States and/or industry. Therefore, the proposal requires Member States to contribute a commensurate amount to the actions of the Competence Centre and Network. The principal decision-making body is the Governing Board, in which all Member States take part but only those Member States which participate financially have voting rights. The Network of National Coordination Centres : each Member State would nominate a national coordination centre to lead the Network, which would focus on developing new and expanded cybersecurity capabilities and expertise. The Network would identify and support the most relevant cybersecurity projects in Member States. The Cybersecurity Competences Community : this would contribute to the mission of the Competence Centre by enhancing and disseminating cybersecurity expertise throughout the Union. It would involve a large and diverse group of actors involved in the development of cybersecurity technologies, such as research organisations, supply and demand side industries and the public sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union's contribution to the Competence Centre to cover administrative and operating costs includes the following elements: EUR 1 981 668 000 from the Digital Europe Programme, of which up to EUR 23 746 000 for administrative costs; EUR 2.8 billion from the Horizon Europe programme, including for administrative costs; this contribution will be proposed by the Commission during the legislative process and, in any case, before a political agreement is reached."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fitness check of EU consumer and marketing law, which also covers Directive 2009/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on injunctions for the protection of consumers' interests, demonstrated that the risk of infringements of Union law affecting the collective interests of consumers is increasing due to economic globalisation and digitalisation. In view of the increase in cross-border trade, it is increasingly common for such infringements to affect consumers in several Member States. The absence of an EU-wide collective redress mechanism is of particular practical relevance to consumer protection, as shown by concrete cases, including the diesel emissions case. In its resolution of 2 February 2012, the European Parliament stressed the need for a horizontal EU approach to collective redress focusing on breaches of consumer rights, based on a common set of principles respecting national legal traditions and providing safeguards against abusive litigation. In this context, this proposal aims to modernise and replace Directive 2009/22/EC on injunctions. It is presented together with the proposal on targeted amendments to four EU consumer law Directives as part of the ""New Deal for Consumers"". IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is to tighten the rules on sanctions, to improve the efficiency of the injunction procedure and to add other measures concerning collective redress for consumers. Stronger mechanisms for collective redress would ensure a higher level of consumer protection in mass harm situations and reduce consumer detriment. As concerns efficiency, all options could lead to initial familiarisation costs, but also to savings for compliant traders. CONTENT: the new Directive replacing Directive 2009/22/EC would aim to ensure that ""qualified entities"" - for example consumer organisations – may seek representative actions to protect the collective interests of consumers. For example, in a Dieselgate-type scenario, victims of unfair commercial practices, such as misleading advertising by car manufacturers, will be able to obtain remedies collectively through a representative action under this proposal. Such collective redress was previously not provided under Union law. The proposed new Directive: covers all infringements by traders of Union law that harm or may harm the collective interests of consumers in a variety of sectors such as financial services, energy, telecommunications, health and the environment; enables qualified entities to be able to seek measures aimed at eliminating the continuing effects of the infringement. These measures should take the form of a redress order obligating the trader to provide for, inter alia, compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract termination or reimbursement of the price paid, as appropriate and as available under national laws. These qualified entities will have to satisfy minimum reputational criteria (they must be properly established, not for profit and have a legitimate interest in ensuring compliance with the relevant EU law). For compensatory collective redress actions, qualified entities would also be required to disclose to the courts or administrative authorities their financial capacity and the origin of their funds supporting the action and to ensure that there are no conflicts of interests or risks of abuse in a given case; sets out the rules requiring the infringing trader to adequately inform the consumers concerned about the final injunction orders, final decisions on measures eliminating continuing effects of the infringements. This provision ensures consumers' awareness about the breach of law and their redress opportunities; requires Member States to ensure that all representative actions are treated with due diligence and that representative actions seeking an interim injunction order are dealt with under an accelerated procedure, while avoiding that procedural costs become a financial barrier to representative actions; favours collective out-of-court settlements, under the control of the courts or administrative authorities. If a decision finding an infringement has become final, it should be irrefutable evidence in any subsequent redress action in the same Member State; ensures the application of effective, dissuasive and proportionate sanctions in cases where a defendant does not comply with a final decision of a court or administrative authority in a representative action."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation on summer-time arrangements was first introduced in 1980 with the objective of unifying existing national summer-time practices and schedules. Since 2001, EU summer-time arrangements have been governed by Directive 2000/84/EC setting out the obligation on all Member States to switch to summer-time on the last Sunday of March and to switch back to their standard time (""winter-time"") on the last Sunday of October. The system of bi-annual clock changes has been increasingly questioned, by citizens, by the European Parliament, and by a growing number of Member States. In its resolution of 8 February 2018, Parliament asked the Commission to carry out an assessment of summer-time arrangements as provided for in Directive 2000/84/EC and, where appropriate, to submit a proposal for revision. The Commission has also carried out a public consultation, which generated around 4.6 million replies, of which 84% were in favour of discontinuing the bi-annual clock changes while 16% wanted to keep them. Against this background, the Commission considers that the arrangements for summer time should be terminated in a coordinated manner in order to avoid any major disruption to the internal market caused by divergences between Member States in this area. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: based on the evidence available on the effects of the EU summer-time arrangements, the conclusion can be drawn that a continued harmonised regime – whereby all Member States abolish the bi-annual time changes – would remain beneficial for the functioning of the internal market. Effects on other areas are rather inconclusive and are likely to depend on the geographical location and whether Member States choose to stay with permanent summer- or permanent winter-time. The impact of this choice therefore needs to be assessed at national level. A change of system will also bring about transition costs that should be considered. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to end seasonal changes in European time from 2019 onwards, while leaving the Member States free to decide whether to permanently apply summer time or winter time. Directive 2000/84/EC will be repealed. Member States wishing to return permanently to winter time may make a final change of seasonal time on Sunday 27 October 2019 (at 01.00 in the morning). From this date, seasonal time changes will no longer be possible. Member States remain free to make changes to their standard time that are not linked to seasonal changes. In order to avoid disturbances Member States should inform the Commission of their intention to change their standard time 6 months before changes take effect. Given that the Member States will have to apply Directive as from 1 April 2019, the Directive provides that each Member State must, by 27 April 2019 at the latest, on the basis of possible consultations and assessments at national level and in concertation with other Member States, notify the Commission of its intention to permanently apply a standard time corresponding to their current winter-time, rather than to their current summer-time."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: road transport was responsible for about 22% of the Union’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2015. Tyres, mainly because of their rolling resistance, account for 5% to 10% of vehicles’ fuel consumption. In 2009, the EU adopted two sets rules relating to tyres: Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters (the Tyre Labelling Regulation, TLR). The TLR, which set out Union requirements harmonising the information on tyre parameters to be provided to end-users allowing them to make informed purchasing choices; Regulation (EC) No 661/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on type-approval requirements for the general safety of motor vehicles (the General Safety Regulation, GSR), which put in place harmonised technical requirements that tyres must satisfy before they can be placed on the Union market. The Commission has reviewed the effectiveness of Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 and identified the need to update its provisions to improve its effectiveness by modifying and enhancing some of its provisions to clarify and update their content, taking into account the technological progress for tyres over recent years. Improving the labelling of tyres will give consumers more information on fuel efficiency, safety and noise, allowing them to obtain accurate, relevant and comparable information on those aspects when purchasing tyres. This will help improve the effectiveness of the tyre labelling scheme so as to ensure cleaner, safer and quieter vehicles and to maximise the scheme’s contribution to the decarbonisation of the transport sector. Tyre labelling forms part of Union legislation on the energy efficiency of products. This initiative is in line with the Union's energy policy. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option revealed the following estimated impacts: (i) increased turnover for business of EUR 9 billion per year by 2030; (ii) 129 PJ annual fuel savings by 2030; (iii) 10 Mt annual CO2-eq savings by 2030; (iv) decreased noise emission from tyres and resultant health benefits; and (v) greater safety and fewer accidents. CONTENT: this proposal aims to repeal and replace Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 on labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters. It establishes a framework for the provision of harmonised information on tyre parameters through labelling, allowing end-users to make an informed choice when purchasing tyres. The proposal aims in particular to: update the tyre label and allowing for its revision : the label covers three parameters: rolling resistance, wet grip and external rolling noise. The classes for these parameters need to be adjusted, to take account of technological progress. The Commission may adopt delegated acts to supplement the Regulation, and to adapt the annexes in the light of technical progress; improve the visibility of the label to consumers: all tyres placed on the market must be accompanied by a label, whether in the form of a separate document or of a sticker; the full label will have to be shown when tyres are sold on the internet and in paper-based distance selling; require that information on the snow and ice performance of tyres be included on the label; allow for the future inclusion of mileage and abrasion , if appropriate, as a parameter for the label. Tyre abrasion is a major source of microplastics released into the environment; require that the label be shown in visual advertisements and technical promotional material; extend to C3 tyres the requirement for the label to be shown; require tyre manufacturers to subject the label declaration to the type approval process thus providing an additional guarantee of the correctness of the label: improve enforcement by creating an obligation to register tyres in the product database established under Regulation (EU) 2017/1369 (supplier identification, model of tyre, label, parameter classes and product information sheet)."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: rapid technological developments continue to transform the way works and other subject-matter are created, produced, distributed and exploited. New business models and new actors continue to emerge. The objectives and the principles laid down by the Union copyright framework remain sound. However, legal uncertainty remains, for both rightholders and users, as regards certain uses, including cross-border uses, of works and other subject matter in the digital environment. As set out in the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards a modern, more European copyright framework’, in some areas it is necessary to adapt and supplement the current Union copyright framework to ensure that the internal market does not fragment. In this context, the Commission has identified three areas of intervention with the aim of modernising the exceptions and limitations on copyright: (i) digital and cross-border uses in the field of education, (ii) text and data mining in the field of scientific research, and (iii) preservation of cultural heritage. The objective is to guarantee the legality of certain types of uses in these fields, including across borders. Evolution of digital technologies has reinforced the role of the Internet as the main marketplace for the distribution and access to copyright-protected content. In this new framework, rightholders face difficulties when seeking to license their rights and be remunerated for the online distribution of their works. Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for measures aiming at improving the position of rightholders to negotiate and be remunerated for the exploitation of their content by online services giving access to user-uploaded content. A fair sharing of value is also necessary to ensure the sustainability of the press publications sector. This proposal is presented in parallel with : a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes; a proposal for a regulation and a directive to implement the Marrakech treaty in order to improve access to format copies of certain works for the benefit of persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment examines the baseline scenarios, policy options and their impacts for eight topics regrouped under three chapters, namely (i) ensuring wider access to content, (ii) adapting exceptions to digital and cross-border environment and (iii) achieving a well-functioning marketplace for copyright. The assessment concluded that, bearing in mind the predominance of SMEs in the creative sectors, the introduction of a special regime would not be appropriate, as it would defeat the purpose of the intervention. CONTENT: complementing Directive 2010/13/EU and the proposal amending it, this draft directive lays down rules which aim at further harmonising the Union law applicable to copyright and related rights in the framework of the internal market, taking into account in particular digital and cross-border uses of protected content. It also lays down rules on exceptions and limitations, on the facilitation of licences as well as rules aiming at ensuring a well-functioning marketplace for the exploitation of works and other subject matter. Measures to adapt exceptions and limitations to the digital and cross-border environment : Member States are obliged to provide for mandatory exceptions or a limitation allowing: text and data mining carried out by research organisations for the purposes of scientific research; digital uses of works and other subject-matter for the sole purpose of illustration for teaching, enabling teachers and students will be able to take full advantage of digital technologies; and cultural heritage institutions ((i.e. publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) to make copies of works and other subject-matter that are permanently in their collections to the extent necessary for their preservation. Measures to improve licensing practices and ensure wider access to content: the proposal requires Member States to: put in place a legal mechanism to facilitate licensing agreements of out-of-commerce works and other subject-matter; the cross-border effects will be ensured; put in place a stakeholder dialogue on issues relating to foster the relevance and usability of the licensing mechanisms and ensure the effectiveness of the safeguards for rightholders; put in place a negotiation mechanism to facilitate negotiations on the online exploitation of audiovisual works. Measures to achieve a well-functioning marketplace for copyright : the proposal provides for: a new right for press publishers aiming at facilitating online licensing of their publications, the recoupment of their investment and the enforcement of their rights; the rights granted to the publishers of press publications under this Directive should have the same scope as the rights of reproduction and making available to the public provided for in Directive 2001/29/EC, insofar as digital uses are concerned; the possibility for all publishers to receive a share in the compensation for uses of works under an exception; measures to improve transparency and better balanced contractual relationships between authors and performers and those to whom they assign their rights; the obligation for Member States to implement negotiation and dispute resolution mechanisms."

For 2019, the additional resources of EUR 99 573 877 in 2011 prices are funded by the Global Margin for Commitments within the margin of the multiannual financial framework for the years 2014-2020. It is appropriate to provide for specific measures facilitating the implementation of the YEI, due to the advanced stage of the implementation of operational programmes for the 2014-2020 programming period. CONTENT: the proposal aims to adapt the amounts of resources available for economic, social and territorial cohesion, the amount of resources for the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) and the annual breakdown of commitment appropriations reflected in Annex VI of Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 to reflect the increase of the resources of the YEI, in line with the adopted budget for 2019. More specifically, commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI should be increased by an amount of EUR 116.7 million in current prices, bringing the overall amount for 2019 up to EUR 350 million. The proposal also introduces provisions to respond to the co-legislators' request for facilitating measures to ensure the swift programming of the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2019, so as not to hamper the overall implementation progress of the 2014-2020 operational programmes. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the proposed amendment should not result in additional payment appropriations needs in 2019. For 2020 the budgetary implication should be limited only to additional payment appropriations to cover the annual pre-financing due on the increased YEI resources."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the challenges that need to be tackled by external action have increased in recent years: regional conflicts, terrorism, economic inequalities and growing migratory pressures, demographic growth and environmental degradation. At the same time, while poverty levels have declined globally, the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem, including in emerging economies. For the next long-term EU budget for the period 2021-2027, the European Commission proposes to increase investment in external actions, to restructure the Union's external action instruments and to integrate the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget in order to ensure greater coherence, to benefit from effective cooperation, to simplify procedures and to achieve economies of scale. The proposed neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument (NDICI) is designed to uphold and promote the Union’s values and interests worldwide in order to pursue the objectives and principles of its external action. It shall be the EU's main instrument for assisting its partners in their political and economic change towards sustainable development, stability, consolidation of democracy, socio-economic development and poverty eradication. The proposal provides a framework for the implementation of external action policies and international obligations that include the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) and UN Security Council Resolution 2282 (2016) on sustaining peace. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the neighbourhood, development and international cooperation instrument programme for the period 2021-2027. It also establishes the European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (the EFSD+) and an external action guarantee. The neighbourhood and international cooperation instrument shall be based on three pillars: a geographical pillar to cover planned cooperation with neighbouring countries and all other third countries. This component shall bring together geographical programmes for the European Neighbourhood, for sub-Saharan Africa, for Asia and the Pacific, and for the Americas and the Caribbean to jointly address global challenges such as human development, including gender equality, climate change; a thematic pillar (achieving common goals), which addresses global issues and/or policy flagship initiatives through specific programmes focusing on human rights and democracy, civil society organisations, stability and peace. a ‘rapid response’ pillar which is dedicated to quick response capacity for crisis management and conflict prevention, as well as strengthening the resilience of states, societies, communities and individuals, the link between humanitarian aid and development actions, and early action to meet other foreign policy objectives. Flexibility reserve : building on the successful experience of the European Development Fund (EDF), an amount should remain unallocated as an emerging challenges and priorities cushion. The cushion shall be used primarily to address migration pressures, but also stability and security needs, unforeseen events and new international initiatives and priorities. New European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) : the EFSD+ shall be an integrated financial mechanism providing financing capacity worldwide in the form of grants, budget guarantees and financial instruments. The EDFD+ shall support the external investment plan and combine blending and budget guarantee operations covered by the external action guarantee, including those covering sovereign risks associated with lending operations previously carried out under the external lending mandate to the European Investment Bank. General principles : the following principles shall apply to the instrument as a whole: democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, rights-based approach, cooperation, dialogue, partnership, development effectiveness, consideration of climate change, environmental protection and gender equality. The proposal also provides for an obligation to inform the European Parliament and to exchange information regularly with it. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the instrument for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 89.2 billion in current prices. EUR 7 billion for thematic programmes : (i) EUR 1.5 billion for human rights and democracy; (ii) EUR 1.5 billion for civil society organisations; (iii) EUR 1 billion for stability and peace; (iv) EUR 3 billion for global challenges; The cushion for emerging challenges and priorities amounting to EUR 10.2 billion may also be used."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a central counterparty (CCP) acts as the intermediary to both sides of a transaction in a financial instrument, including bonds, equities, derivatives and commodities (such as agricultural products, oil and natural gas). The importance of CCPs has nearly doubled since the post-crisis G20 commitment to clear standardised over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives through CCPs. This obligation is implemented in the EU by the Regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (‘EMIR’). That Regulation also sets out comprehensive prudential requirements for CCPs, as well as requirements regarding the operations and oversight of CCPs. However, no harmonised EU rules exist for the unlikely situations in which CCPs would face severe distress – beyond that envisaged by EMIR – or outright failure. Recovery and resolution measures are required in order to safeguard financial stability, ensure the continuity of critical functions and protect taxpayers. The tools currently available to Member State authorities are inadequate to deal with CCPs that face significant stress. In December 2013 the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Commission to propose appropriate EU measures to ensure that the impacts of a potential failure of key financial institutions, most notably CCPs, could be mitigated. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: this concluded that EU action is necessary given the cross-border nature of CCPs' business, which links multiple financial actors, counterparties and clients throughout the single market. CONTENT: the draft regulation lays down rules and procedures relating to the recovery and resolution of CCPs authorised in accordance with EMIR Regulation. It also lays down rules relating to the arrangements with third countries in the field of recovery and resolution of CCPs. It sets out provisions comparable to those in the EMIR framework applicable to banks and investment firms to facilitate orderly recovery and resolution but adapts them to the specific features of CCPs. Objectives : these are: first, to seek the orderly recovery of CCPs in various scenarios of financial distress through the implementation of recovery plans that are agreed between the CCP and its clearing members; if this were to be insufficient, authorities should take swift action in order to safeguard financial stability. Set-up of resolution authorities and resolution colleges : resolution authorities for CCPs shall be set up and equipped with a harmonised set of powers to undertake all the relevant preparatory and resolution actions. Furthermore, CCPs’ resolution authorities are required to set up resolution colleges for each CCP containing all the relevant authorities including the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European banking Authority (EBA). Preparation – recovery plans : CCPs are required to prepare recovery plans to overcome any form of financial distress which would exceed their default management resources and other requirements under EMIR. Preparation – resolution plans and resolvability assessments : resolution authorities are required to prepare resolution plans for how CCPs would be restructured and their critical functions kept alive in the event of their failure. The plans should outline the resolution powers and tools which authorities would employ in case a CCP meets the conditions for resolution. Early intervention : this will ensure that financial difficulties are addressed as soon as they arise and problems can be averted. Competent authorities are granted specific powers to intervene in the operations of CCPs where their viability is at risk but before they reach the point of failure. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: crowdfunding has emerged as an established practice of funding a project or a venture, typically by a large number of people or organisations, through online platforms on which citizens, organisations and businesses, including business start-ups, raise relatively small amounts of money. Crowdfunding can thus provide an alternative to unsecured bank lending, which are currently the main sources of external finance for SMEs. The provision of crowdfunding services generally relies on three types of actors: the project owner that proposes the project to be funded, investors who fund the proposed project, generally by limited investments, and an intermediating organisation in the form of a service provider that brings together project owners and investors through an online platform. Several Member States have already introduced domestic bespoke regimes on crowdfunding. Those regimes are tailored to the characteristics and needs of local markets and investors. As a result, the national rules diverge as regards the conditions of operation of crowdfunding platforms, the scope of permitted activities and the licencing requirements. The differences between the existing national rules are such as to obstruct the cross border provision of crowdfunding services. It is therefore necessary to address the existing obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market in crowdfunding services. This initiative is part of the Commission's priority of establishing a Capital Market Union (CMU), which aims to broaden access to finance for innovative companies, start-ups and other unlisted firms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that EU crowdfunding markets for business finance are largely underdeveloped compared to other major economies but - and most importantly - unable to properly operate cross-border. Amongst the options studied, the preferred option consists of introducing an EU-label for crowdfunding service providers, which would be authorised and supervised at EU level under an EU regime. CONTENT: the Commission’s proposal introduces an optional EU scheme that allows crowdfunding platforms to easily deliver their services across the EU single market. It establishes a one-stop-shop access to the EU market and therefore helps crowdfunding platforms in overcoming the barriers they face operating cross-border. The proposal does not intend to interfere with national bespoke regimes or existing licenses, including those under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II), the Payment Services Directive (PSD) and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), but rather to provide crowdfunding service providers with the possibility to apply for an EU label that empowers them to scale up their operations throughout the Union under certain conditions. Scope : the proposal applies to crowdfunding services involving financial remuneration for investors. Donation and reward-based crowdfunding are excluded from the scope of this initiative, as they cannot be considered financial services. The proposal does not include in its scope consumers lending for consumption purposes. Effective and prudent management : crowdfunding service providers must at all times comply with the organisational requirements, while natural persons having the power to manage a crowdfunding service provider should have appropriate skills and professional experience. A crowdfunding service provider must maintain and operate effective organisational and administrative arrangements with a view to taking all reasonable steps designed to prevent conflicts of interest from adversely affecting the interests of its clients. Authorisation and monitoring : the proposal provides uniform, proportionate and directly applicable requirements for authorisation and a single point of supervision. Crowdfunding service providers will provide their services under the supervision of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). Investor protection and transparency : the proposal also aims to provide investors with the necessary information on crowdfunding, including the underlying risks. Accordingly, all information, including marketing communications, from crowdfunding service providers to clients must be complete, clear and correct. The proposal sets out an initial assessment of the appropriateness of a potential client and provides that platforms shall offer investors the possibility to simulate their ability to bear losses. The proposed regulation also provides for adequate safeguards to minimize the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the preferred option holds implications in terms of costs and administrative burden for ESMA. Assuming that ESMA will be in charge of authorising and supervising 25 providers in the first full year of implementation (2020), there will be a cost impact (net of fees charged on the industry) of approximately EUR 1 637 000 in that year. This estimate also includes half of EUR 500 000 in one-off costs to be split over the first two years, used to setup the necessary IT systems. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: crowdfunding is a financing model normally involves the project owners that propose the project to be funded, investors that support the proposed project through funding and a moderating platform that brings the parties together to finance and launch the project in question. Crowdfunding platforms are increasingly used as a tool to finance various activities for small and nascent firms. Some Member States have already introduced domestic bespoke regimes on crowdfunding. However, Member States tailor their regulatory frameworks to the characteristics and needs of local markets and investors, which results in differences of how the rules are designed and implemented with respect to the conditions of operation of crowdfunding platforms, scope of permitted activities and licencing requirements. Due to the lack of an appropriate EU framework for crowdfunding activity, crowdfunding services providers are facing difficulties in scaling their operations and cross-border flows remain limited. The proposal for a regulation on European crowdfunding service providers aims to facilitate their provision on a cross-border basis, while managing operational risks and ensuring a high degree of transparency and investor protection. In the interest of legal certainty and in order to avoid the application of requirements stemming from Directive 2014/65/EU to the provision of crowdfunding services, it is necessary to explicitly specify that Directive 2014/65/EU does not apply to persons authorised as crowdfunding service providers as defined in the proposed regulation on European crowdfunding service providers. This initiative is related to part of the Commission's priority of establishing a Capital Market Union (CMU), which aims to broaden access to finance for innovative companies, start-ups and other unlisted firms. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the main economic and social impacts have been thoroughly examined in the impact assessment accompanying the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European crowdfunding service providers. CONTENT: this proposal amends the scope of Directive 2014/65/EU in order to exempt crowdfunding service providers from the obligations arising from Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: for the next multiannual financial framework covering the period 2021-2017, the Commission proposes to modernise cohesion policy to help redress imbalances within and between Member States. Based on the evidence that t he applicable rules were overly complex and fragmented between the different funds and the various forms of financing, the Commission proposed to establish a single rulebook for seven EU funds implemented under shared management in order to simplify access to and use of EU Funds (Common Provisions Regulation - CPR). The aims of the ERDF is to help to redress the main regional imbalances in the Union through participation in the development and structural adjustment of regions whose development is lagging behind and in the conversion of declining industrial regions. The Cohesion Fund contributes financially to projects in the field of the environment and trans-European transport infrastructure networks. In many countries, the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund represent at least 50% of public investment - these Member States would not otherwise have the financial capacity to make such investments. There is considerable potential for spill-over effects across national and regional borders, for example in terms of investment in innovation and SMEs. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - sets out the provisions applicable to both ERDF and Cohesion Fund intervening under the ‘Investment for jobs and growth’ goal and, with regard to the ERDF, under the ‘European territorial cooperation’ goal (Interreg). Objectives for ERDF and Cohesion Fund : the ERDF shall support the achievement of the following policy objectives (PO): a smarter Europe through innovation, digitisation, industrial change and support for small and medium-sized enterprises (PO 1); a greener, low-carbon Europe, investing in energy transition, renewable energy and the fight against climate change (PO 2); a more connected Europe with strategic transport and digital communication networks (PO 3); a more social Europe, which will support quality jobs, education, skills, social inclusion and equal access to health care (PO 4); a Europe closer to citizens, which will support locally driven development strategies and sustainable urban development across the European Union (PO 5). The Cohesion Fund shall support PO 2 and specific objectives under PO 3 in particular the development of a sustainable, climate resilient, intelligent, secure and intermodal TEN-T as well as promoting sustainable multimodal urban mobility. Operations under the ERDF are expected to contribute 30 % of the overall financial envelope of the ERDF to climate objectives (37% under the Cohesion Fund). Landfills, airport infrastructure, the tobacco industry, decommissioning of nuclear facilities shall not be supported by the funds. Thematic concentration : in the current context of budget cuts, the proposed Regulation provides that the majority of ERDF and Cohesion Fund investments shall be geared towards the first two objectives: a smarter Europe (PO 1) and a greener Europe (PO 2). Member States shall invest between 65% and 85% of their resources under the two funds in these priority areas, depending on their income ratio: countries with GNI above 100% of the EU average shall allocate at least 85% of their ERDF resources to PO 1 and 2, and at least 60% to PO 1; countries with GNI between 75% and 100% of the EU average shall allocate at least 45% of their ERDF resources to PO 1 and at least 30% to PO 2; countries with a GNI below 75% of the EU average should allocate at least 35% of their ERDF resources to PO 1 and at least 30% to PO 2. This thematic concentration shall be attained at national level, with some flexibility at the level of individual programmes and between the three groups of Member States formed according to their gross national income. Scope of the funds : the ERDF shall support the following: (a) investments in infrastructure; (b) investments in access to services; (c) productive investments in SMEs; (d) equipment, software and intangible assets; (e) information, communication, studies, networking, cooperation, exchange of experience and activities involving clusters; (f) technical assistance; the Cohesion Fund shall support the following: (a) investments in the environment, including investments related to sustainable development and energy presenting environmental benefits; (b) investments in TEN-T; (c) technical assistance. Indicators : in order to ensure consistent monitoring of progress achieved, the proposed Regulation refines the common set of output indicators, while adding for the first time a common set of results indicators. These latter enable reporting results in real time on the Open Data Platform and comparison across programmes and Member States. Evaluations will include lessons learned, problems and opportunities to further improve the actions and their impacts. Specific territorial factors : the proposal provides for an increased focus on sustainable urban development by dedicating 6% of ERDF resources to this area, delivered through territorial instruments. It also provides for the setting up of a European Urban Initiative to be managed by the Commission. The proposal also sets out special measures to accommodate the specific situation of outermost regions. These include schemes to offset transport costs and investments. Proposed overall budget : the Commission proposal for a multiannual financial framework provides for an envelope of EUR 273 billion for the ERDF and the Cohesion Fund for the period 2021-2027, of which: (i) ERDF: EUR 200.62 billion and; (ii) Cohesion Fund: EUR 41.34 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: reducing the negative impact of transport activities remains one of the main goals of the Union's transport policy. With the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in force, the transition to a modern and low-carbon economy will need to accelerate. Council Directive 92/106/EEC which establishes measures to encourage the development of combined transport, is the only legislative act of the Union to directly incentivise the shift from road freight to lower emission transport modes such as inland waterways, maritime and rail. However, since the Directive was adopted in 1992, some of these conditions, e.g. the use of paper transport documents and stamps as proof of eligibility for combined transport and the freight market environment have undergone considerable changes. While the Directive has helped shift a considerable amount of freight away from road, shortcomings in the implementation of that Directive and the limited scope of its support measures, have significantly reduced its impact. According to estimations, the goal of reaching 30% of road freight over 300 km shifted to other modes of transport such as rail or waterborne transport by 2030, and more than 50% by 2050, in order to optimise the performance of multimodal logistic chains, including by making greater use of more energy-efficient modes, has been slower than expected and according to the current projections, will not be reached. In order to improve the competitiveness of combined transport compared to long-distance road freight, thereby strengthening the shift to other modes for the transport of goods, the Commission considers that a revision of the Directive is necessary in order to: (i) clarifying and extending the definition of combined transport; (ii) improving the monitoring of eligibility and enforcement conditions; (iii) increasing the effectiveness of incentives; and (iv) improving the reporting and monitoring conditions of the Directive. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the strategic option chosen aims to simplify the eligibility criteria, better define the enforcement conditions and broaden the economic support measures. CONTENT: this initiative aims to support multimodality and strengthen the shift from road freight by addressing the shortcomings of the existing legislation (Directive 92/106/EEC) and in particular by extending its scope using a broader set of possible support measures. In concrete terms, the proposal aims to: review the definition of ‘combined transport’ by extending its scope to national services and by further specifying the maximum distance of the road leg as 150 km or 20 % of the total distance, irrespective of the non-road leg type (rail, inland waterways or maritime), while ensuring that flexibility is allowed due to specific geographical or operational constraints in Member States; extend the economic support measures put in place by the Member States, i.e. investment support and operational support (e.g. vehicle tax breaks) and additional support measures that Member States may adopt to complement existing ones in order to reduce the cost of a combined transport operation and to make it more competitive compared to the equivalent road-only operation; specifies which documents an operator must provide to demonstrate the existence of combined transport and receive assistance from the State. Thus, the proposal: (i) defines the condition for road transport to be considered as part of a combined transport operation; (ii) lists and details the data to be provided as evidence; (iii) states that no additional document shall be required to prove the combined transport operation; (iv) provides the conditions of presentation of the evidence, including for the purposes of a roadside check. The Commission proposes to use documents in electronic format more efficiently; introduces the obligation for Member States to report to the Commission, 18 months after the date for transposition of the Directive, data on the conditions of the combined transport market in their territory, including on the relevant infrastructure and the adopted national support measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 lists the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of a visa when crossing the external borders of the Member States and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. It is applied by all Member States – with the exception of Ireland and the United Kingdom – and also by Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The Regulation is part of the EU’s common visa policy for short stays of 90 days in any 180-day period. Kosovo is currently listed in Annex I, Part 2 of Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 , i.e. among those entities and territorial authorities that are not recognised as states by at least one Member State. Persons from those entities are required to hold a visa when travelling to the territory of EU Member States. Since launching the visa dialogue in January 2012, the Commission has presented regular reports to the European Parliament and to the Council on its assessment of Kosovo’s fulfilment of the requirements of the roadmap which identified all the legislation and other measures that Kosovo needed to adopt and implement to advance towards visa liberalisation. In its last report, the Commission set out recommendations corresponding to outstanding requirements of the visa roadmap, including four key priorities. It noted the border/boundary delineation agreement with Montenegro should be ratified by Kosovo before visa free status is granted to persons from Kosovo. In its latest report, the Commission observed that Kosovo had taken important steps towards fulfilling the requirement of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and fulfilled sufficient elements of building up its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Based on this assessment and given the outcome of the continuous monitoring and reporting that had been carried out since the launch of the visa liberalisation dialogue with Kosovo, the Commission confirms that Kosovo has met the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap on the understanding that by the day of the adoption of this proposal by the European Parliament and the Council, Kosovo will have ratified the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. CONTENT: taking account of all the criteria which should be considered when determining on a case-by-case basis the third countries whose nationals are subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 (as introduced by Regulation (EU) No 509/2014), the Commission has decided to present a legislative proposal to amend Regulation (EC) No 539/2001, transferring Kosovo from Annex I, Part 2 (visa-required list) to Annex II, Part 4 (visa-free list). A footnote will be added specifying that the visa exemption will be limited to holders of biometric passports issued in line with the standards of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and EU standards for security features and biometrics in travel documents (Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004). Territorial provisions : the proposed regulation will constitute a development of the Schengen acquis. Therefore, the United Kingdom and Ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the Regulation and shall not be bound by it or subject to its application. The amended Regulation will be directly applicable from the date of its entry into force and will be implemented immediately by Member States. No implementation plan is necessary. The Commission will continue to actively monitor Kosovo’s process of ratifying its border/boundary agreement with Montenegro and the development of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. (*) This designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and is in line with UNSCR 1244/1999 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017 as well as the European Council in December 2017 stated that education and culture are key to building inclusive and cohesive societies for all, and to sustaining European competitiveness. Culture and cultural expressions manifest themselves strongly in the daily life of the Union's citizens and can contribute to wellbeing, active citizenship, common values, social inclusion and the development of intercultural dialogues as well as of a free, pluralistic and diverse media environment. The digital environment and global competition are creating new challenges for the European cultural and creative sectors. There is a highly fragmented market for cultural and creative works stemming from Europe's cultural and linguistic diversity. At the same time, the transnational circulation of works remains limited. It is therefore important to stimulate the transnational circulation and co-production of works across borders and to develop more effective solutions to reach audiences across borders. Lastly, there is a growing phenomenon of disinformation. Content industries, in particular the news media sector, are at the core of the fight to maintain a culture of healthy democratic debate. Building on the results of the 2014-2020 creative Europe programme, the Commission proposes an increase in the budget allocated to the programme in order to respond to the challenges of digitisation and globalisation by providing greater support to the European cultural and creative sectors. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the creative Europe programme for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the 2014-2020 creative Europe programme. The objectives of the proposed new programme are: enhancing the economic, social and external dimension of European level cooperation to develop and promote European cultural diversity and Europe's cultural heritage and strengthening the competitiveness of the European cultural and creative sectors and reinforcing international cultural relations; promoting the competitiveness and scalability of the European audiovisual industry; promoting policy cooperation and innovative actions , including the promotion of a diverse and pluralistic media environment, media literacy and social inclusion. The programme has three strands: (1) MEDIA (audiovisual sector) : the programme shall continue to support the production, distribution and promotion of European films, television programmes and video games. This strand shall: promote European audiovisual works and reach out to new audiences in Europe and beyond. To address these priorities, support is provided for the creation, promotion and distribution of, and access to, European works with the potential of reaching out to wide audiences in Europe and beyond. The creation of structured partnerships and networks to strengthen the competitiveness of the European audiovisual sector should also be encouraged. (2) CULTURE (cultural and creative sectors, except audiovisual) : the programme shall support cooperation projects, networks and platforms to interconnect talented artists across Europe and assist cultural and creative operators in their efforts to reach audiences across Europe. This component shall also: increase cultural participation throughout Europe; promote social inclusion through culture and cultural heritage; strengthen European identity and values through cultural awareness; contribute to the Union's global strategy for international relations through cultural diplomacy. Some existing special actions, such as the European Capital of Culture and the European Heritage Label shall be reinforced. (3) CROSS SECTORIAL STRAND : this strand shall support cross sectoral activities extending to the whole audiovisual sector and to other cultural and creative sectors. It shall promote knowledge of the programme and support transferability of results. It would also encourage innovative approaches to the creation, distribution, promotion and access to content in all sectors of culture and creation. The funds shall also be used to promote European cooperation in the field of cultural policy, with a view to fostering a free, diverse and pluralistic media environment and supporting quality journalism and media literacy. Proposed budget : EUR 1.85 billion for the period 2021-2027, according to the following indicative breakdown: MEDIA strand: up to EUR 1.08 billion; CULTURE strand: up to EUR 609 million; CROSS SECTORIAL strand: up to EUR 160 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Erasmus programme already enables millions of young Europeans to study, train or learn abroad while broadening their experience and awareness of Europe, and increasing their future chances on the labour market. It is one of the Union's most visible achievements. In its Communication adopted on 2 May 2018, the Commission proposed to put more emphasis on youth in the context of the next multiannual financial framework, notably by doubling the size of the Erasmus+ programme 2014-2020. The resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 14 September 2017 stressed that the future programme should aim to be accessible to all young people and that these higher ambitions should be reflected in an increase in the budget for the next programming period. In a context of rapid and profound changes induced by technological revolution and globalisation, the Commission considers it essential to invest in learning mobility and exchanges within the framework of a significantly reinforced, inclusive and extended programme. The ambition for the next programme goes hand in hand with the Commission's vision to work towards a European Education Area by 2025 empowering young people and promoting a European identity through youth, education and culture policies. The programme is one of the funding instruments under the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework aiming at investing in people, social cohesion and values. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Erasmus programme for education, training, youth and sport for the period 2021-2027 which will succeed the Erasmus+ 2014-2020 programme established by Regulation (EU) No 1288/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The programme aims to support learning mobility opportunities that contribute to the personal, educational, civic and professional development of individuals. It shall also support cooperation between stakeholders at organisational and policy level with a view to foster inclusion, excellence, creativity and innovation in education, training, youth and sport. Objectives : in particular, the proposed new programme shall: be accessible to a larger number of people : the programme shall support all categories of learners, whether they are in higher education, general education, vocational education or training, adult education, non-formal learning, youth and active participation activities. The goal is to triple the number of participants; a broader focus on people from all social backgrounds : the programme shall further facilitate the participation of people with fewer opportunities, including people with disabilities and migrants, as well as EU citizens living in remote areas. Mobility opportunities for students, people in vocational training, apprentices and young people should be extended; help Europeans to acquire new skills : the programme shall support activities to equip citizens with the necessary knowledge, skills and competences, including language skills, in a lifelong learning perspective. It shall pay greater attention to digital skills and future-oriented areas such as climate change, clean energy, artificial intelligence, robotics, data analysis, arts/design, etc. address a wider target group both within and beyond the EU : mobility and cooperation with third countries shall be enhanced through a combination of physical and virtual mobility and the use of more flexible learning mobility formats to meet the needs of certain target groups, such as adult learners. The programme shall also facilitate the participation of small scale and grassroots organisations; promote a European identity : the programme shall encourage youth participation in Europe’s democratic life by raising awareness about common European values, including fundamental rights, bringing together young people and decision-makers at local, national and EU level and contribute to the European integration process. A new initiative called DiscoverEU shall give young people the opportunity to discover other EU countries. The programme would also contribute to promoting common European values through sport, good governance and integrity in sport; strengthen the Union's relations with the rest of the world : intensify international mobility and cooperation with third countries - in particular enlargement, neighbourhood, industrialised and emerging countries - in order to support institutions and organisations in Europe in facing the challenges of globalisation. Key actions : the proposal defines specific objectives for each of the three action areas of the programme (education and training, youth and sport). Each of these three areas would be structured around three key actions: ‘learning mobility’ (key action 1); ‘cooperation among organisations and institutions’ (key action 2) and ‘support to policy development and cooperation’ (key action 3). In order to simplify requirements for beneficiaries, it is proposed to use simplified grants in the form of lump-sums, unit-costs and flat-rate funding should be used to the maximum possible extent. The future Erasmus monitoring and evaluation framework shall follow an approach based on continuous monitoring to assess the progress towards achieving the output and results targets of the programme. Proposed budget : EUR 30 billion for the period 2021-2027, according to the following indicative breakdown: EUR 24.94 billion for actions in the field of education and training; EUR 3.10 billion for actions in the youth field; EUR 550 million for actions in the field of sport; and at least EUR 960 million as a contribution to the operating costs of the national agencies."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: sustainability and the transition to a low-carbon and climate resilient, more resource-efficient and circular economy are key in ensuring long-term competitiveness of the Union’s economy. In March 2018, the Commission published its action plan 'Financing Sustainable Growth' setting up an ambitious and comprehensive strategy on sustainable finance. One of the objectives set out in that action plan is to reorient capital flows towards sustainable investment in order to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. In line with the Paris Climate Change Agreement and the 2030 UN Sustainable Development Agenda, this proposal is part of a broader Commission initiative to facilitate investment in sustainable projects and assets across the European Union. In particular, it defines uniform criteria for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable. The proposal is presented in parallel with: a proposal to bring institutional investors (management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), alternative investment fund managers (AIFs), insurance undertakings, institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORPs), European venture capital fund managers (EuVECA), European social entrepreneurship fund managers (EuSEF) and investment firms) to integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into their internal processes and inform their clients in this respect; a proposal to help investors compare the carbon footprint of investments. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is that of a unified EU classification system (or taxonomy). An EU uniform classification would help determine which activities can be considered sustainable and send the right signals to economic actors, as it would translate EU policy objectives into concrete guidelines for identifying relevant projects or investments. It could therefore help to direct more capital towards sustainable investments. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation seeks to standardise the criteria for determining whether an economic activity is environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree of environmental sustainability of an investment. Environmental sustainability criteria for economic activities : the proposal provides for criteria and a procedure for identifying environmentally sustainable investments, in order to avoid distortions of the single market due to differences in the interpretation of this concept between Member States. According to these criteria, the economic activity should contribute substantially to one or more environmental objectives without causing significant harm to any other. These environmental objectives are: (1) climate change mitigation; (2) climate change adaptation; (3) sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources; (4) transition to a circular economy, waste prevention and recycling; (5) pollution prevention and control; (6) protection of healthy ecosystems. In recognition of the principles enshrined in the European Pillar of Social Rights, economic activity should also be pursued in accordance with minimum international social and labour standards. The Commission may adopt delegated acts specifying the technical screening criteria for determining what constitutes a substantial contribution to an environmental objective and what constitutes substantial harm to other objectives, those criteria also apply. Disclosure obligations : the proposal requires those financial market participants that are subject to the disclosure obligations set out in the proposed Regulation on improving sustainability disclosure referenced above (e.g. fund managers) to disclose the degree of environmental sustainability of those financial products that they claim pursue environmental objectives. If a fund manager offers a fund claiming it is a 'green fund', then for that particular fund the manager will have to indicate the way and the extent to which the criteria for environmentally sustainable economic activities were used to determine the environmental sustainability of the investment in the fund's pre-contractual disclosure document. Sustainable Finance Platform : the proposal provides for a process involving a multi-stakeholder Platform to establish at EU level a uniform classification system based on a set of clear criteria to determine which economic activities may be considered sustainable. This Platform will assist the Commission in the progressive development and the update of the EU classification system. The European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) will play a key role in developing the European sustainability taxonomy to ensure that it is usable by financial institutions, applicable to financial products and compatible with EU financial legislation. The European Environmental Agency (EEA) will also be closely involved in the sustainable finance work. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the European Commission will be responsible for managing the Platform (e.g. organising its meetings and meetings of any sub-groups, reporting on the outcome, preparing legislative proposals, liaising with the ESAs and the EEA, maintaining an IT collaborative tool, reimbursing experts, performing other secretarial tasks, etc). In order to accomplish these and other tasks, the European Commission would need 10 full-time employees as of 2020. The total impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 10.496 million for the period 2020-2023."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: among the main social rules applying to the transport sector are the following: provisions on the organisation of drivers' working time set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; minimum requirements for enforcement set out in Directive 2006/22/EC; rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods under Regulation (EC) No 561/2006; provisions on posting of workers established in Directive 96/71/EC and the enforcement Directive 2014/67/EU. The current evaluation of the social legislation in road transport in the EU has shown shortcomings in the current legal framework and problems regarding enforcement. Furthermore, a number of discrepancies exist between Member States in interpretation, application and implementation of the rules. This creates legal uncertainty and unequal treatment of drivers and operators, which is detrimental to the working, social and competition conditions in the sector. The Commission aims to amend the existing rules in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable, whilst at the same time mitigating the excessive regulatory burdens on operators and preventing distortions of competition. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: four options were considered. The first policy option focused on clarifying the legal framework and increasing cooperation between enforcement authorities. The second focused on strengthening enforcement and improving working patterns for workers. The third proposed substantive changes in the rules, in particular banning performance based pay. The fourth option comprised sector specific criteria and specific enforcement measures for the posting of workers in the road transport sector. Significant savings for operators result mainly from the latter option, and in particular the measures on administrative and control requirements. These savings are in the range of EUR 785 million per year in administrative costs. CONTENT: the proposal makes a limited number of amendments to Directive 2006/22/EC and lays down sector-specific rules on posting of workers in the road transport sector in relation to Directives 96/71/EC and 2014/67/EU. Requirements on enforcement : the Commission proposes to amend Directive 2006/22/EC in order to: require that checks carried out by Member States include checking compliance with the working time provisions set out in Directive 2002/15/EC; require that the information submitted by Member States to the Commission on the results of checks at the roadside and at premises to include checks on compliance with Directive 2002/15/EC; specify that serious infringements giving rise to checks at premises of road transport undertakings shall also include infringements of Directive 2002/15/EC; improve administrative cooperation between Member States with regard to the implementation of the social rules in road transport has proven insufficient, making cross-border enforcement more difficult, inefficient and inconsistent. It is therefore necessary to establish a framework for effective communication and mutual assistance, including exchange of data on infringements and information on good practices in enforcement; further improve the effectiveness, and consistency of the existing national risk rating systems : the Commission will establish a uniform formula for calculating the risk rating of transport undertakings, and take into account certain criteria, such as the use of the 'smart' tachygraph. Data in the risk rating system must be made available to control authorities. Posting of workers : the Commission proposes that drivers are considered as posted workers if they spend at least 3 days in a given calendar month on the territory of a Member State. All cabotage operations will be considered as posting of workers from day 1 – regardless of their duration. The minimum rate of pay and the minimum annual paid holidays of the host Member State should apply to cabotage irrespective of the frequency and duration of the operations carried out by a driver. For the purposes of the calculation of the periods of posting: a daily working period shorter than six hours spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as half a day; a daily working period of six hours or more spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as a full day; breaks and rest periods as well as periods of availability spent in the territory of a host Member State shall be considered as working period. The proposal lays down the specific administrative requirements and control measures for checking compliance with the provisions on posting of workers in road transport."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: driving and resting times of drivers are regulated under EU law. Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 (the 'Driving Time Regulation') and Regulation (EU) 165/2014 on tachographs are part of a wider effort to improve the working conditions of drivers, ensure fair competition between operators and improve the road safety of European roads. An evaluation the effectiveness and efficiency of the implementation of the existing set of Union social rules in road transport, identified certain deficiencies in the existing legal framework. Unclear and unsuitable rules on weekly rest, resting facilities, breaks in multi-manning and the absence of rules on the return of drivers to their home, lead to diverging interpretations and enforcement practices in the Member States. The objective of this proposal is to rectify the identified shortcomings and to help improve the working and business conditions in the sector in order to make the road transport sector fair, efficient and socially accountable. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is a combination of two policy options: the first focused on strengthening enforcement, whilst the second established sector-specific criteria for posting workers in road transport and provides for specific enforcement measures. The impacts of the preferred option include improving the working and resting conditions of drivers (decrease in fatigue index by 28% and in periods away from home by 43% for EU-13 drivers and by 16% for EU-15 drivers). CONTENT: the proposal introduces a limited number of modifications to Regulation (EC) No 561/2006 on driving time and Regulation (EU) No 165/2014 on tachygraphs. Driving time : the main amendments proposed are as follows: private individuals using vehicles which would fall within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, to carry private belongings for their own purposes, are not obliged to record their driving times and rest periods and are therefore not obliged to have or use a tachograph or a driver's card; there is a uniform definition of the notion of 'non-commercial' carriage; drivers will have to record all tasks other than driving and also record any periods of availability; this will effectively monitor a driver's working patterns; drivers may arrange for their weekly rest periods in a more flexible manner over a period of four consecutive weeks, while ensuring that compensation for a reduced weekly rest is taken together with a regular weekly rest within three weeks. Any compensation for a reduced weekly rest must be attached to a regular weekly rest of at least 45 hours; a driver is not allowed to take a weekly rest of 45 hours or more in a vehicle. An employer is obliged to provide a driver with adequate accommodation with appropriate sleeping and hygiene facilities if drivers are not able to take a weekly rest at a private place of their choice; transport undertakings must organise the drivers' work in such a way that they are able to return to their home for a weekly rest at least once within three consecutive weeks; drivers may postpone the start of their weekly rest to reach their home provided that they comply with the daily and weekly driving time limits and with the required minimum duration of a weekly rest period; temporary exceptions from the general rules granted by Member States in urgent cases must be appropriately justified by the exceptional circumstances and the urgency involved in addressing them; Member States must inform the Commission about their national rules on driving times, breaks and rest periods applicable to the bus drivers exempted from the Regulation; national penalties imposed for infringing the Regulation should be proportionate to the seriousness of the infringement, as classified in relevant Union legislation. Tachygraph : the proposed amendments aim to improve the features of 'smart' tachographs to make it possible to more precisely position vehicles used for cross-border transport operations. The proposal adds an obligation on drivers to record in a tachograph the position of their vehicle after having crossed a border, at the earliest suitable stopping place."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Commission. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: currently, two Regulations are in place with the general objective of supporting the good functioning, efficiency and competitiveness of the single market in road transport: Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings must comply with, in order to access the occupation of road transport operator (passenger and freight); Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 lays down the provisions that undertakings intending to operate on the international road haulage market and on national markets other than their own (cabotage) must comply with. Experience with the implementation of these Regulations revealed that the rules provided for in those regulations offered scope for improvement on a number of points. The proposal is part of a broader ongoing review of the road transport legislation. It is closely linked to other existing legal acts concerning road transport, in particular the social legislation for road transport (Regulation (EC) No 561/2006, Directive 2002/15/EC, Directive 2006/22/EC and Regulation (EU) 165/2014. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option combines substantive changes in the rules on cabotage and establishment, with a partial extension of Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 to light vehicles. This option is estimated to generate savings for businesses in the range of EUR 2.7-5.2 billion for the EU-28 in 2020-2035. Infringements of cabotage rules should be reduced by up to 62% and the formation of letterbox companies should be reduced by around 10%. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 on access to the occupation of road transport operator and Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on access to the international road transport market. The main amendments are as follows: Requirements for engagement in the occupation of road transport operator : the Commission proposes: to include in the scope of the Regulation vehicles the permissible laden mass of which does not exceed 3.5 tonnes (‘light commercial vehicles’): requirements on the transport manager, good repute, professional competence and obligations related to those requirements are not proposed as mandatory, but Member States would keep the possibility of applying them as hitherto. By contrast, the requirements regarding effective and stable establishment and appropriate financial standing are proposed to apply to such hauliers in all Member States; to clarify provisions to ensure that undertakings established in a Member State have a real and continuous activity there; to clarify and further harmonise the assessment of good repute and to extend the list of infringements which may lead to loss of good repute. Serious infringements of national tax rules are taken into account in the assessment of the good repute of the transport manager or transport undertaking, as are serious infringements of EU rules on the posting of workers and the law applicable to contractual obligations; to set out the means by which undertakings may prove their financial standing in the absence of certified annual accounts, in order to enable the assessment of compliance with this criterion by enforcers, in particular for newly created undertakings which have no certified accounts yet; to clarify the position of competent authorities where undertakings no longer comply with the requirement of financial standing; to specify that, after having lost good repute, a transport manager cannot be rehabilitated by the competent authority earlier than one year from the date of loss of good repute; to add elements of information to be included in the national electronic registers to allow better enforcement of the rules on access to the profession. Access to the international road transport market Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 : the Commission proposes to specify: that the carriage of empty containers or pallets is to be considered as a carriage for hire and reward only if it is subject to a transport contract between a consignee and a consignor; that a cabotage operation can involve several loading points, several delivery points or several loading and delivery points. Until now, EU rules allowed for 3 cabotage operations within 7 days of the international delivery. The new rules will allow for unlimited cabotage operations within 5 days of the international delivery. Member States must carry out a minimum amount of checks of compliance with the cabotage provisions (i.e. 2% of cabotage operations from 1 January 2020 and 3% from 1 January 2022). DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with the provisions of Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 provides that the Union budget should continue to support fisheries and maritime affairs policies. Europe's maritime sector employs over 5 million jobs generating almost EUR 500 billion a year, with a potential to create many more jobs. The output of the global ocean economy is estimated at EUR 1.3 trillion and this could more than double by 2030. Fisheries are vital to the livelihood and cultural heritage of many coastal communities in the EU and an essential part of their cultural heritage. Along with aquaculture, it also contributes to food security and nutrition. EU support is a key tool for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of the sea's biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans, notably in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) for the period 2021-2027. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall be repealed. The new Fund shall support the environmental, economic, social and employment objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), promote the implementation of the Union's maritime policy and support the Union's international commitments in the field of ocean governance. The fund's support shall be based on four priorities: 1. Fostering sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources : support from the EMFF shall aim to achieve and maintain sustainable fishing based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and to minimise the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem with particular attention to small-scale fishermen. That support shall include innovation and investments in low-impact, climate resilient and low-carbon fishing practices and techniques. Support for fleet adaptation remains sometimes necessary with regard to certain fleet segments and sea basins. Such support should be tightly targeted to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and aimed to achieve balance between the fishing capacity and the available fishing opportunities. 2. Contributing to food security in the Union through competitive and sustainable aquaculture and markets : the EMFF may support the promotion and the sustainable development of aquaculture, including freshwater aquaculture, for the farming of aquatic animals and plants for the production of food and other raw material. Public health actions, aquaculture stock insurance schemes and animal health and welfare actions shall also be eligible. 3. Enabling the growth of a sustainable blue economy and fostering prosperous coastal communities : the fund shall support community-led local development under shared management to stimulate economic diversification in a local context through the development of coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture and a sustainable blue economy. It shall also support the collection, management and use of data to improve knowledge of the state of the marine environment. 4. Strengthening international ocean governance and enabling safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans : the EU plays a leading role in particular in preventing, deterring and eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, improving the international framework for ocean governance, reducing pressures on oceans and seas, creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy and strengthening international ocean research and data. The EMFF shall support these international commitments and objectives under direct management. The EMFF shall also contribute to achieving the Union's environmental objectives in the light of the Commission's proposal to increase the total share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25%. Simplification : under the proposal, the EMFF beyond 2020 shall evolve towards a simplified architecture. Its effectiveness shall be improved by (i) allowing Member States to target support based on their strategic priorities; (ii) better targeting of support for the CFP; and (iii) better alignment with other EU funds since the rules applicable to all structural and investment funds are laid down in a Common Provisions Regulation. In concrete terms, the EMFF shall co-finance projects alongside national funding streams with each Member State receiving a share of the total budget. Member States would prepare their national operational programmes indicating how they intend to spend the funds. Once these programmes have been approved by the Commission, the national authorities would decide which projects they wish to finance. Proposed budget : the proposed overall budget for the EMFF amounts, in current prices, to EUR 6.14 billion, of which (i) EUR 5.31 billion allocated to support under shared management by the Member States through EMFF programmes based on national strategies and (ii) EUR 829 million to direct management. Concerning shared management, after having deducted the value of the UK programme (EUR 243 million), Member States would retain, in nominal terms, 96.5% of their 2014-2020 allocation. In order to ensure stability in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, the definition of national allocations will be based on the 2014-2020 shares."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Decision No 1152/2003/EC is the founding decision for the computerised system (Excise Movement and Control System – EMCS). At the moment it covers only movements of excise goods under excise duty suspension. In order to allow the automation of the procedure for the movement of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State, Decision No 1152/2003/EC has to be modified. Since most provisions of the Decisions are affected by such modification, the Decision should be recast in the interests of clarity. This proposal accompanies the proposal for a Council Directive laying down the general arrangement for excise duty as regards the automation of the procedure for movements of excise goods which have been released for consumption in the territory of one Member State and that are moved to the territory of another Member State in order to be delivered for commercial purposes in that other Member State. CONTENT: the objective of the proposal is to extend the excise movement and control system to intra EU movements of excise goods that are released for consumption, in order to simplify the procedure and allow for proper monitoring of such movements, and to provide a base for the governance of further automations of processes defined by Union excise legislation, where such automation is considered beneficial. It is proposed to amend most of the provisions of Decision No 1152/2003/EC so as to allow the possibility of automating any procedure used for the movement and control of excise goods. Specifically, the computerised system is intended to: permit the electronic transmission of the accompanying documents and the improvement of checks; improve the functioning of the internal market, by simplifying the intra-Union movement of excise goods and affording Member States the possibility of monitoring the flows in real time and of carrying out the requisite checks where necessary."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council defines the common rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds). Evidence suggests that the annual pre-financing paid to Member States for a given accounting year is set at a particularly high level in comparison with financial management requirements stemming from the implementation of operational programmes; this is in particular the case for the budgetary years 2021 to 2023. This means in practice that payment credits are requested from Member States from payment appropriations in the Union's budget to pay to them annual pre-financing that a year later has to be recovered to a significant extent. Therefore, in order to ease the pressure on payment appropriations in the Union budget for the budgetary years 2021 to 2023 and to enhance the predictability of payment requirements, the Commission proposes that for the last three years of the current implementation period 2021-2023, the annual pre-financing is reduced to the necessary minimum. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the proposal is not expected to have significant economic, social or environmental impacts. It will result in reducing the annual pre-financing for the proposed years, which will contribute to increasing the predictability of budgetary planning, to a more stable and predictable payment profile, to the reduction of the risk of payment backlogs, to increased transparency in payment needs and, therefore, to better budgetary management. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 aims to decrease the annual pre-financing from 3% of the amount of the support from the Funds and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (‘EMFF’) for the whole programming period to the operational programme to 1% for the years 2021-2023. The annual pre-financing for the year 2020 is maintained at 3% of the amount of the support from the Funds and the EMFF for the whole programming period to the operational programme. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the proposal has no impact on commitment appropriations since no modification is proposed to the maximum amounts of the ESI Funds financing provided for in the operational programmes for the programming period 2014-2020. The amendment proposed will contribute to a reduction in payment appropriations related to the year 2021 entirely due to the reduction of the annual pre-financing amounts which will be compensated by higher payment needs for the year 2024. For the years 2022 and 2023, lower annual pre-financing will be offset in the framework of the examination and acceptance of accounts, therefore the effect is neutral."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a common and comparable legal framework for European statistics on migration and international protection. To respond to new needs within the Union for statistics on asylum and managed migration, and the rapidly changing characteristics of migration, the Commission considers that there is a need for a framework allowing quick response to changing needs as regards statistics on asylum and managed migration. The Commission has regularly acknowledged the need to improve the collection of statistics, particularly as regards the figures on the return of third-country nationals staying illegally in the EU, and as regards children. CONTENT: the main purpose of this initiative is to amend Regulation (EC) No 862/2007 so as to provide a legal basis for existing voluntary data collections already conducted by most national authorities, while providing the necessary flexibility to adapt to future data needs. On the basis of information provided by stakeholders and taking into account immediate priorities to address the most serious shortcomings, it is proposed to: increase the frequency of statistics on returns and obligations to leave from annual to quarterly, while introducing additional disaggregations; introduce new disaggregations of asylum statistics by unaccompanied minors; add new disaggregations of resettlement statistics; introduce statistics on first-time asylum applicants and new statistics on Dublin re-examination requests; introduce new disaggregations of statistics on residence permits. In order to ensure a better availability of European statistics on asylum and managed migration and to introduce a flexibility mechanism, the Commission could adopt implementing acts for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions on disaggregations."

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Lisbon Agreement for the Protection of Appellations of Origin and their International Registration of 31 October 1958 created a special union within the framework of the Union for the Protection of Industrial Property which was established by the Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property signed in Paris on 20 March 1883. The contracting parties undertake to protect on their territories the appellations of origin of products of the other countries within the Special Union which are recognised and protected as such in the country of origin and which are registered at the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), unless those parties declare, within a period of one year from the receipt of the notification of such a registration, that they cannot ensure such protection. Seven Member States are parties to the Lisbon Agreement, namely Bulgaria (since 1975), the Czech Republic (since 1993), France (since 1966), Italy (since 1968), Hungary (since 1967), Portugal (since 1966) and Slovakia (since 1993). Three other Member States have signed, but not ratified the Lisbon Agreement, namely Greece, Spain and Romania. The Union itself is not a party to the Lisbon Agreement as it provides that only countries can accede to it. On 20 May 2015, the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on Appellations of Origin and Geographical Indications was adopted which revised the Lisbon Agreement. In order for the Union to be able to properly exercise its exclusive competence for the areas covered by the Geneva Act and its functions in the context of its comprehensive protection systems for agricultural designations of origin and geographical indications, the Union should accede to the Geneva Act and become a contracting party thereto. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the accession of the European Union to the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement on designations of origin and geographical indications (Geneva Act). The Geneva Act expands the scope of the Special Union in order to extend the protection of appellations of origin of products to all geographical indications. The revised Agreement:  outlines the terms, conditions and processes by which contracting parties may seek protection for registered appellations of origin and geographical indications, while allowing for appropriate safeguards and transitional periods for certain entities; allows contracting parties, with regard to procedures relating to applications and international registration, to request a declaration of intent to use, if necessary, the protection provided by their national legislation of the Geneva Act and the Common Regulations under the Lisbon Agreement and the Geneva Act of the Lisbon Agreement; increases the registration fees from 500 CHF to 1000 CHF, future flexibility has been introduced to allow Members to further contribute to the budget as required. An individual fee can be required by Contracting Parties in order to covers the cost of substantive examination of the international registration; constitutes the obligation for each Contracting Party to protect registered appellations of origin and geographical indications on its territory, within its own legal system and practice but in accordance with the terms of this Act, subject to any refusal, renunciation, invalidation or cancellation that may become effective with respect to its territory; lays down the content of protection: each contracting party is required to provide the legal means to prevent use of the appellation of origin or geographical indication in respect of goods of the same kind but different origin and in respect of goods not of the same kind or services if such use would indicate or suggest a connection between those goods or services and the beneficiaries, and would be likely to damage their interests, or to impair or dilute or take unfair advantage of, the reputation of the AO/GI; effectively ensures that protected designations may not subsequently become generic; explicitly provides for coexistence of appellations of origin or geographical indications with prior trade mark rights; allows contracting parties to provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark; provides for the option of a phasing out period for prior uses; does not refer to invalidity grounds and hence allows any Contracting Party to invoke its domestic rules, in line with EU legislation, which does not have an enumerative list of invalidation grounds, either. The Geneva Act will enter into force three months after five parties have ratified it."

The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks to approve on behalf of the Union the Agreement between the European Union and the Philippines on certain aspects of air services. The Agreement replaces certain provisions of the existing bilateral air services agreements concluded between the Member States and the Republic of the Philippines: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. - Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. CONTENT: on 19 November 2013, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations on behalf of the Union in order to conclude a new international agreement on olive oil and table olives. The text of the agreement was adopted on 9 October 2015 by the representatives of 24 Member States of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and two intergovernmental organisations during the United Nations Conference for the Negotiation of a Successor Agreement to the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 2005. In accordance with Council Decision (EU) 2016/1892, the Agreement was signed on behalf of the Union on 28 November 2016 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The Agreement entered into force provisionally on 1 January 2017. It is now necessary for the Agreement to be approved. CONTENT: the Council calls for the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the International Agreement on Olive Oil and Table Olives, 2015. The Agreement establishes a decision-making body, called the ‘Council of Members’, which exercises all powers and performs all the functions necessary to achieve the objectives of the Agreement. The Commission should be authorised to represent the Union in the Council of Members. In order to facilitate the adoption of amendments to the Agreement such as those regarding the designations and definitions of oils, olive pomace oils and table olives as set out in annexes B and C of the Agreement, the Commission should be authorised to approve proposed amendments on behalf of the Union, under specific substantive and procedural conditions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: BACKGROUND: sovereign bond-backed securities (‘SBBSs’) can address some vulnerabilities that have been exposed by or have resulted from the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Reducing risks to financial stability by facilitating the diversification of banks' sovereign portfolios and further weakening the bank-sovereign nexus is of high importance for the completion of the Banking Union. This legislative proposal is part of the Commission's efforts to enhance Banking Union and Capital Markets Union. It aims to enable the emergence of an efficient market for SBBSs over time. In turn, SBBSs could support further portfolio diversification in the financial sector, while creating a new source of high-quality collateral particularly suited for use in cross-border financial transactions. In mid-2016, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) established a high-level task force (henceforth, the ESRB task force) to assess SBBSs' merits and feasibility. The ESRB task force concluded that a market for SBBSs can develop under certain conditions. Yet, whether or not SBBSs are viable can ultimately only be ascertained by putting them to a market test. This proposal paves the way for such a market test. A key finding of the ESRB task force, corroborated also by interactions with market participants and other stakeholders, is that the current regulatory framework constitutes a significant hindrance to the development of SBBSs. Under the existing regulatory framework, SBBSs would be defined as securitisation products, and hence would be treated significantly less favourably than their underlying portfolio of euro area sovereign bonds. However, due to the nature of their underlying assets and their standardised and simple nature, SBBSs carry risks that are comparable to the underlying sovereign bonds rather than regular securitisations. The Commission will also adopt the necessary changes to the prospectus schedules and building blocks to ensure that appropriate disclosure for this new type of financial instrument, tailored to the characteristics of the product, are set out. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: because the proposed framework only enables the private-sector led development of an SBBSs market, but does not guarantee it, the impact assessment considered two distinct scenarios to evaluate impacts, one in which SBBSs reach only a limited volume (EUR 100 billion) and a steady-state one in which they reach EUR 1.5 trillion. As regards the impact of SBBSs on the diversification of banks' sovereign portfolios, the assessment showed that the impact would be small in the limited volume scenario, but significant under the steady state scenario. CONTENT: this proposal aims to provide an enabling framework for a market-led development of Sovereign Bond-Backed Securities. SBBS operation : SBBSs would be created by the private sector specifically set up for the sole purpose of issuing to investors a series of securities representing claims on the proceeds from this underlying portfolio. The various securities issued would bear any losses from the underlying portfolio in a certain sequence (i.e., losses would accrue first to holders of sub-senior, or subordinated, securities and only after such securities have been completely wiped out would they also accrue to the holders of senior claims). SBBSs would not rely on any risk sharing or fiscal mutualisation between Member States. Only private investors would share risks and possible losses. SBBSs are therefore very different from Eurobonds. Composition and structure of a SBBS issue : the proposal provides a set of rules that define the constitutive elements of SBBSs. These rules are necessary to ensure that as standardised a product as possible is produced by the markets. This in turn favours its liquidity and appeal to investors. Under the proposal, the underlying portfolio of SBBSs should be composed of sovereign bonds of all EU Member States whose currency is the euro. A SBBSs issue should be composed of a senior tranche, corresponding to 70 percent of the nominal value of SBBSs issue, and one or more subordinated tranches. The purpose of the subordinated tranches is to provide protection to the senior tranche, which therefore is a low risk instrument. Notification and transparency : the proposal provides rules that define notification and transparency requirements for the issuing entity to ensure that self-attestation is performed in a harmonised and credible way. To ensure that investors are protected from the risk of insolvency of the institution that acquires the sovereign bonds (original purchaser, typically a bank), the issuance of SBBSs should be undertaken by a Special Purpose Entity (SPE) that is exclusively devoted to the issuance and management of SBBSs. The SPEs are responsible for compliance with the product and notification requirements. The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is entrusted with the publication of notifications on its website. This will ensure that the SPEs take responsibility for claiming that a product qualifies as an SBBS and that there is transparency in the market. SPEs shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from incorrect or misleading notifications under the conditions stipulated by national law. Monitoring : the proposal contains rules regarding the supervision of SBBSs and possible sanctions in case of non-compliance and/or fraudulent behaviour of the issuing entity. It requires Member States to designate competent authorities in accordance with existing EU financial services legislation. The sanctions inflicted to a special purpose entity should be published. In addition, an SBBS which is found not fulfilling the requirements of the proposed Regulation should be removed without undue delay from the list of SBBS established by ESMA. Lastly, the proposal contains a set of amendments to the existing legal framework required to grant SBBSs regulatory treatment in line with their unique design and properties."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council BACKGROUND: the evaluation of Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship (""Written Statement Directive"") has highlighted weaknesses in the scope of the Directive and indicated how its effectiveness could be improved. This Directive no longer corresponds to the evolution of the labour market, in particular as regards the new ""non-standard"" forms of employment which have appeared in the last ten years. Since 2014, more than five million jobs have been created, of which almost 20% in new forms of employment. The adaptability of new forms of employment to changes in the economic context has enabled new business models to develop, including in the collaborative economy, and has offered entry into the labour market to people who previously would have been excluded. In response some Member States have put in place new regulations and national social partners have developed new collective agreements, leading to an increasingly diverse regulatory system across the EU. This initiative is one of Commission's key actions to follow up on the European Pillar of Social Rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017. It also responds to the resolution of the European Parliament of 19 January 2017 requesting a framework Directive on decent working conditions in all forms of employment, and of 4 July 2017 on working conditions and precarious employment, calling for a revision of the 1991 Directive to take account of new forms of employment. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred combination of measures shows that a substantial improvement of working and living conditions is expected. Most notably, at least 2-3 million non-standard workers will enter into the scope of the Directive. Enhanced predictability for some 4-7 million workers should have a positive impact on work-life balance and health. Some 14 million workers might request a new form of work. Lack of exclusivity clauses will allow some 90 000-360 000 on-demand workers to seek additional work and earn EUR 355-1 424 million per year extra. Non-quantified benefits for employers include higher retention and loyalty, improved worker relations, fewer complaints and court cases, better resource planning, contributing to an overall increase in productivity. CONTENT: the proposed Directive aims to replace the 1991 Written Statement Directive with a new instrument that ensures transparency about working conditions for all workers and defines new substantive rights to improve predictability and security of working conditions, particularly for those in precarious employment. The proposal: extends the scope of the Directive to forms of employment which are today often excluded , such as domestic work, casual workers (for instance those carrying out on-demand or intermittent work), short-term employees, domestic workers, platform workers or voucher-based workers. Member States could decide to exclude very short-term assignments of less than 8 hours per month from the scope of the Directive; provides that workers will receive up-to-date and detailed information (paper or electronic) from their first day of work. This information will cover: (i) probation (if any); (ii) training provided by employer; (iii) arrangements and remuneration for overtime; (iv) information on working time for workers on very variable schedules; (v) social security institution where contributions are paid; establishes minimum rights that apply to all workers in the Union : (i) limit the length of probationary periods to 6 months, unless longer is objectively justified; (ii) right to work for other employers, with a ban on exclusivity clauses and restrictions on incompatibility clauses; (iii) right to predictability of work: workers with variable working schedules determined by the employer (i.e. on-demand work) should know in advance when they can be requested to work; (iv) possibility to request a more stable form of employment and to receive a justified written reply (within 1 month; for SME's within 3 months and orally for repeated requests); (v) right to cost-free mandatory training; introduces two alternative procedures for addressing missing information : positive presumptions (if no relevant information supplied, no probation, permanent and/or full time employment relationship); administrative procedure to issue injunction to employer to supply missing information. The proposal also introduces provisions based on existing social acquis on compliance, right to redress, prevention of adverse treatment, burden of proof on dismissal, and penalties are introduced."

BACKGROUND: with the adoption of Directive (EU) 2017/1371 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the Union has substantially strengthened the means available to protect the financial interests of the Union by means of criminal law. The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) will have the power to carry out criminal investigations and bring indictments related to criminal offences affecting the Union budget, as defined in Directive (EU) 2017/1371, in the participating Member States. The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) conducts administrative investigations into administrative irregularities as well as into criminal behaviour. At the end of its investigations, it may make judicial recommendations to the national prosecution authorities, aimed at enabling indictments and prosecutions in the Member States. In future, in the Member States participating in the EPPO, it will report suspected criminal offences to the EPPO, and will collaborate with it in the context of its investigations. In view of their common goal to preserve the integrity of the Union budget, OLAF and the EPPO should establish and maintain a close relationship based on sincere cooperation and aimed at ensuring the complementarity of their respective mandates and coordination of their action, in particular as regards the scope of the enhanced cooperation for the establishment on the EPPO. The European Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) 883/2013 concerning investigations conducted by OLAF in order to ensure the highest level of protection of the Union's financial interests through synergies between the two bodies. CONTENT: the proposed amendment to Regulation No 883/2013 is a consequence of the adoption of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and aims to ensure consistency in the legal framework for the protection of the Union's financial interests. It has three specific objectives: (i) adapt the operation of OLAF to the establishment of the EPPO; (i) enhance the effectiveness of OLAF’s investigative function; (iii) clarify and simplify selected provisions of Regulation No 883/2013. As the revised Regulation should be in force by the time the EPPO becomes operational, the proposal therefore contains a limited number of essential changes necessary in the short term to strengthen the framework for OLAF investigations, in order to maintain a strong and fully functioning OLAF that complements the EPPO's criminal law approach with administrative investigations, but which do not entail a change to its mandate or powers. To this end, the proposal introduces the necessary provisions into OLAF's legal framework as regards: OLAF's obligation to report without undue delay to the EPPO any conduct over which the latter may exercise its competence; the information provided to the European Public Prosecutor's Office shall be sufficiently substantiated and contain the necessary information; non-duplication of investigations : OLAF shall not open a parallel investigation into facts identical to those under investigation by the European Public Prosecutor's Office; the specific procedural rules applicable to requests from the European Public Prosecutor's Office to OLAF to support or complement the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office. The amendment also provides for a number of limited clarifications aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of OLAF's administrative investigations, based on the Commission's recent evaluation. The focus is on those areas where, at present, the lack of clarity in certain provisions of the existing Regulation hinders the effectiveness of OLAF's interventions. The proposal: includes rules improving the performance of on-the-spot checks and inspections: the proposed amendments maintain the current powers and would provide a clearer framework for the application of national law, thus specifying more clearly the applicable safeguards and the rights of the operators concerned. The conduct by OLAF of on-the-spot checks and inspections, where economic operators submit to a check by OLAF, is subject to Union law alone. During on-the-spot checks, the economic operator concerned would have the right not to incriminate himself and to be assisted by a person of his choice; provides OLAF with access to bank account information and provides OLAF with the necessary tools to carry out its VAT checks. The proposal specifies the obligation of Member States to assist OLAF by transmitting information relating to bank accounts. It also allows OLAF to exchange information with the Eurofisc network; introduces a principle of admissibility of OLAF reports - subject only to a verification of authenticity – in judicial proceedings of a non-criminal nature before national courts and in administrative proceedings in the Member States. It specifies the role of the anti-fraud coordination services in the Member States in order to ensure that OLAF is provided with the assistance it needs for its investigations to be effective."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the customs 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing customs cooperation. Many of the activities in the customs area are of a cross-border nature, involving and affecting all Member States, and therefore they cannot be effectively and efficiently delivered by individual Member States. Since 2016, the Union Customs Code is the new legal customs framework. The Code triggered a massive digitalisation project with 17 different electronic systems to be fully in place by 2020. Some systems will be deployed gradually up to 2025. These electronic systems touch upon all customs procedures. The upcoming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU implies disentangling the United Kingdom as a Member State from all existing customs electronic systems financed by customs 2020. These implications and costs however cannot be precisely estimated at this stage. The implementation of all these aspects can only be achieved through intense operational cooperation between customs administrations of the Member States, between them and other authorities, with trade and other third parties. It is therefore necessary to ensure the continuity of the Union’s financing of customs cooperation activities by establishing a new cooperation programme in this area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the customs programme for cooperation in the field of customs for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the customs 2020 programme. Objective : the general objective of the proposed new programme is to support the customs union and customs authorities to protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States, to ensure security and safety within the Union and to protect the Union from unfair and illegal trade, while facilitating legitimate business activity. Customs cooperation and capacity building shall focus, on the one hand, on human networking and competency building actions and, on the other hand, IT capacity building actions. Like the current Customs 2020 programme, the new programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. It may provide funding in any form provided for in the Financial Regulation, in particular grants, procurements and reimbursement of expenses. Eligible actions : the programme shall cover expenses for preparation, monitoring, control, audit, evaluation and other activities for managing the programme and evaluating the achievement of its objectives. It shall also cover expenses relating to studies, meetings of experts, information and communication actions, in so far as they are related to the objectives of the programme, as well as expenses linked to information technology networks focusing on information processing and exchange, including corporate information technology tools and other technical and administrative assistance needed in connection with the management of the programme. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of the European electronic systems ‘common components’ and ‘national components’ reflecting better the reality of electronic systems and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand and the Member States on the other hand have been listed. Lastly, a multi-annual strategic plan for customs, to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 950 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Council decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, annexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark does not take part in the adoption of Title V acquis and therefore does not participate in the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013, which allows law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac for the purpose of preventing, detecting and investigating terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. On 8 March 2006, the Agreement between the European Community and Denmark concerning the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged by a third-country national in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and the 'Eurodac' system for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention was concluded. However, access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes does not fall within the scope of that agreement. At a meeting on 14 May 2014 with representatives of the Commission, Denmark and the associated countries confirmed their interest in entering into negotiations with the European Union to extend the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to them via an international agreement. The negotiations have been finalised and an Agreement in the form of a Protocol to the Agreement of 8 March 2006, extending the application of the Agreement of 8 March 2006 to law enforcement was initialled. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision aims to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol to the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention, extending that agreement to law enforcement. The Protocol establishes the application of Regulation (EU) No 603/2013 to Denmark regarding access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes. The Protocol: - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of the other participating States and Europol to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by Denmark when trying to establish the identity of, or obtain more information on, a terrorist or serious crime suspect;; - enables the designated law enforcement authorities of Denmark to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data transmitted to the Eurodac Central System by the other participating States; - guarantees that the current EU level of protection of personal data is applicable to the processing of personal data pursuant to the Protocol by the authorities of Denmark and of the Member States; - conditions the access to Eurodac for law enforcement purposes by Denmark by prior legal and technical implementation of Decision 2008/615/JHA with regard to dactyloscopic data.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values. The proposed new Horizon Europe programme builds on the success of the previous framework programme, Horizon 2020. Horizon 2020 has already attracted the world’s best research institutions and researchers, supported 340 000 researchers, and developed Europe’s skilled human capital. Scientific publications from Horizon 2020 are world class and have contributed to major scientific breakthroughs. Specifically, Horizon Europe shall strengthen the EU’s scientific and technological bases in order to help tackle the major global challenges of our time and contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). At the same time, the programme shall boost the Union’s competitiveness and help deliver on the Union’s strategic priorities. According to the Commission, the new programme is expected to increase GDP on average by 0.08% to 0.19% over 25 years and directly generate an estimated gain of up to 100 000 jobs in R&I activities in the ‘investment phase’ (2021-2027). The economic activity generated by the Programme is expected to foster an indirect gain of up to 200 000 jobs over 2027-2036, of which 40% will be highly skilled. The proposal is in line with the headline target of investing 3% of the EU’s GDP on research and development. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Horizon Europe research and innovation framework programme for the period 2021-2027 and lays down the rules for participation and dissemination of results applicable to indirect actions carried out under the programme. The programme’s general objective is to deliver scientific, economic and societal impact from the Union’s investments in research and innovation in order to: (i) strengthen the scientific and technological bases of the Union and foster its competitiveness, including in its industry; (ii) to deliver on the Union strategic priorities; (iii) contribute to tackling global challenges, including the Sustainable Development Goals. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ has a more ‘top down’ directed approach addressing Union and global policy and competitiveness challenges and opportunities. These are integrated into five clusters (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. Alongside the regular calls for proposals, a limited set of highly visible missions shall be introduced. These will be designed in the context of a strategic planning process. Missions, with ambitious but time-bound and achievable goals, should speak to the public and engage it where relevant. They will be co-designed with Member States, the European Parliament, stakeholders and citizens. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ shall essentially focus on scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation by establishing a European Innovation Council, support the enhancement of European ecosystems of innovation and continued support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The European Innovation Council shall offer a one-stop-shop to high-potential innovators. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology shall complement the European Innovation Council by promoting sustainable innovation ecosystems and developing entrepreneurial and innovation skills in priority areas through its knowledge and innovation communities. The three pillars shall be underpinned by activities to strengthening the European Research Area, specifically: sharing excellence to fully exploit the potential in less R&I performing countries. Cross-cutting elements : the Commission proposes to: significantly strengthen international cooperation by extending association agreements to include countries with excellent science, technology and innovation capacities; make the principle of open science the modus operandi of the new programme by requiring open access to publications and data which shall accelerate the commercialisation and diffusion of innovation; rationalise the current plethora of European partnerships so that they can continue in simplified forms that are open to all (such as academia, industry, Member States, and philanthropic foundations). These partnerships shall be designed on the basis of Union added value, transparency, openness, impact, leverage effect; enhance synergies with other EU programmes to promote faster dissemination and uptake of research and innovation results. Rules for participation and dissemination : these shall have the following new features: (i) continuation of the principle of a single set of rules for participation and dissemination through further improvements; (ii) maintenance of ‘Horizon 2020’ funding rates; (iii) simplification of the cost reimbursement scheme, in particular the actual costs scheme for personnel costs; (vi) increased emphasis on exploitation and dissemination of results, particularly in the Union; (vi) communication by beneficiaries of Union funds, including to the public and the media. For Horizon Europe, the award criteria shall be excellence; impact; and quality and efficiency of the implementation. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the Framework Programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices. The indicative distribution of this amount shall be: EUR 25.80 billion for pillar I ‘Open Science’; EUR 52.70 billion for Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’; EUR 13.50 billion for pillar III ‘Open innovation’; EUR 2.10 billion for the part ‘Strengthening the European Research Area’."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while the proposal for a Regulation establishing the framework programme for research and innovation ‘Horizon Europe’ for the period 2021-2027 sets out the general and specific objectives of Horizon Europe, the structure and the broad lines of activities to be carried out, this proposal for a Decision aims to define the operational objectives and the activities which are specific to parts of Horizon Europe. The Horizon Europe proposal is in line with the Commission proposal on the next multiannual financial framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The proposal is framed by the premise that research and innovation (R&I) delivers on citizens’ priorities, boosts the Union’s productivity and competitiveness, and is crucial for sustaining our socio-economic model and values, and enabling solutions that address challenges in a more systemic way. CONTENT: the proposal for a Decision seeks to establish the specific programme implementing Horizon Europe - the framework programme for research and innovation. It lays down the operational objectives of the specific programme, the budget for the period 2021 – 2027, the rules for implementation of the specific programme and activities to be carried out under this programme. Horizon Europe is comprised of 3 pillars , namely: Pillar I ‘Open Science’ which builds on the success of the European Research Council, the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions and the Research Infrastructures component in the current framework programme. Pillar II ‘Global issues and industrial competitiveness’ includes five thematic clusters that address the full spectrum of global challenges through top-down collaborative R&I activities: (i) health; (ii) inclusive and secure society; (iii) digital and industry; (iv) climate, energy and mobility; (v) food and natural resources. A small number of missions with specific goals will be launched from within the pillar. Pillar III ‘Open Innovation’ which essentially consists of: (i) scaling up breakthrough and market-creating innovation through a new European Innovation Council; (ii) activities aiming at enhancing and developing the overall European innovation landscape, including support to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). Strategic planning : the implementation of Horizon Europe shall be steered by an inclusive and transparent strategic planning process of the research and innovation activities the programme will fund. The strategic planning exercise shall lay out a multiannual strategy for the development of work programme content, though it will remain sufficiently flexible to respond rapidly to unexpected needs and crises. This proposal lays down specific provisions for the programming and implementation of the framework programme, in particular for: (1) Missions (under the global issues and industrial competitiveness pillar ): these missions shall be co-designed and decided as part of the Horizon Europe strategic planning process, which shall include collaboration between the relevant Commission services, Member States, the European Parliament and relevant stakeholders. The first few missions shall be introduced in the first strategic planning exercise. Based on the first two years' experience, the number and scale of missions may be increased in subsequent work programmes. Whilst the duration of the Union support to missions shall not be expected to exceed 10 years and shall be subject to regular review (through the work programme cycle), the timeframe for expected impact of missions may spread out beyond this timeframe. For co-designing the missions and steering their implementation, the Commission may set up mission boards whose members shall be appointed by the Commission, following an open call for expressions of interest. (2) The European Research Council (ERC) : the Commission shall establish a European Research Council (ERC) to implement the actions under Pillar I 'Open Science' which relate to the ERC. The ERC shall be composed of the independent Scientific Council and the dedicated implementation structure responsible for the administrative implementation and programme execution. The President shall be appointed by the Commission following a transparent recruitment process involving an independent dedicated search committee, for a term of office limited to four years, renewable once. (3) The European Innovation Council (EIC) : to implement the EIC, the Commission shall establish a high level board (the EIC Board) that shall advise, inter alia, on the overall strategy, objectives, activities, evaluation criteria and selection of experts. The EIC shall be the sole channel for the Union support to breakthrough market-creating innovation. It shall provide direct tailor-made support to innovators through two main funding instruments – the Pathfinder and the Accelerator – which shall both focus through a mainly bottom-up, high-risk approach on breakthrough innovation; on innovator needs and be pro-actively managed. (4) Work programmes : the programme shall be implemented by work programmes referred to in Article 110 of Financial Regulation. They shall be prepared following a strategic planning process. Work programmes shall set out, where applicable, the overall amount reserved for blending operations. (5) Committee procedure : for the implementation of Horizon Europe, the Commission shall be assisted by a committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011. It would meet in different configurations according to the matter to be discussed. Proposed budget : the financial envelope for the implementation of the framework programme for the period 2021-2027 shall amount to EUR 94.10 billion in current prices."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: online platforms are key enablers of digital trade. At present, more than a million EU enterprises trade through online platforms in order to reach their customers, and it is estimated that around 60% of private consumption and 30% of public consumption of goods and services related to the total digital economy are transacted via online intermediaries. The growing intermediation of transactions through online intermediation services, fuelled by strong data-driven indirect network effects, lead to an increased dependence of such business users, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, on those services in order for them to reach consumers. The dependence of businesses on certain online services implies that the providers of such online intermediation services have a scope to engage in a number of potentially harmful trading practices which limit business users' sales through them and risk undermining their trust, notably: unexplained changes in terms and conditions without prior notice; the delisting of goods or services and the suspension of accounts without a clear statement of reasons; lack of transparency related to the ranking of goods and services and of the undertakings offering them; unclear conditions for access to, and use of, data collected by providers. Furthermore, online general search engines exhibit a dependency-enabled issue, specifically for potentially harmful ranking practices, which may affect business users. Building on extensive stakeholder consultation, this initiative contributes to the objectives of the digital single market strategy by creating a clear, transparent and stable legal environment for online B2C service providers and their business users, in order to combat market fragmentation and ensure that businesses using online intermediation services have access to redress opportunities throughout the Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the optimal policy choice aims to provide legally binding transparency and redress obligations on the full range of potentially harmful trading practices identified as part of this initiative, including transparency for the issue of ranking in online general search. The Commission considers that the proposal should be capable of reversing a dampening effect on the online platform economy resulting from a lack of trust of business users amounting to at least between EUR 810 million and EUR 4 billion. CONTENT: the proposed new Regulation: lays down obligations for providers of online intermediation services and, in certain respects, online search engines to provide business users and corporate website users, respectively, with appropriate transparency and to offer them certain redress possibilities; obliges providers of online intermediation services to ensure that their terms and conditions: (i) are drafted in clear and unambiguous language; (ii) are easily available for business users; (iii) set out the objective grounds for decisions to suspend or terminate, in whole or in part, the provision of their online intermediation services to business users; establishes requirements for a statement of reasons from a provider of online intermediation services if it suspends or terminates the use by a business user of its intermediation services; establishes requirements for a description of the main parameters determining ranking of business users in search results, including a description where ranking is influenced by the business user giving direct or indirect remuneration to them, in the terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement to include a description of the access to personal data or other data which business users or consumers provide to online intermediation services or which are generated through those services, in the standard terms and conditions used by providers of online intermediation services; establishes a requirement for providers of online intermediation services to list in their terms and conditions one or more mediators with which the provider is willing to engage to reach an agreement out of court on a dispute, for instance where an issue has not been resolved by the internal complaint handling system; establishes a requirement for the Commission to encourage providers of online intermediation services to individually or jointly set up one or more independent mediator organisations to facilitate the settlement, out of court, of disputes that arise in the course of online intermediation services, particularly given their cross-border nature; establishes a right for judicial proceedings to be brought by representative organisations, associations or public bodies to stop or prohibit any non-compliance by providers of online intermediation services with the requirements contained in the Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: space technology, data and services have become indispensable in the daily lives of Europeans and play an essential role in preserving many strategic interests. Space supports many policies and strategic priorities of the Union. It can play a crucial role in effectively tackling new challenges such as climate change, sustainable development, border control, maritime surveillance and security of Union citizens. The Union’s space industry is already one of the most competitive in the world. However, the emergence of new players and the development of new technologies are revolutionising traditional industrial models. It is therefore crucial that the Union remains a leading international player with extensive freedom of action in the space domain, that it encourages scientific and technical progress and support the competitiveness and innovation capacity of space sector industries within the Union, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, start-ups and innovative businesses. The Commission stressed in the space strategy for Europe, the importance of ensuring the continued operation of the services offered by Galileo and EGNOS (the global and regional satellite navigation systems) and Copernicus (Union Earth observation and monitoring programme) and of preparing new generations of these services, enhancing the space surveillance and tracking (SST) services and announced the governmental satellite communications initiative ‘GOVSATCOM’. The Commission's approach was advocated both by the Council in its conclusions adopted on 30 May 2017 and by the European Parliament in its resolution of 12 September 2017. The development and implementation of a space programme is beyond the financial and technical capabilities of a single Member State and can only be achieved at EU level. By providing a coherent framework for future investment, a fully integrated space programme shall bring together all the Union's activities in this highly strategic field. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the space programme of the Union for the period 2021-2027. It aims to consolidate all existing and new space activities in a single programme. The general objectives of the proposed new programme are as follows: provide high-quality, up-to-date and, where appropriate, secure space data, information and services, where possible on a global scale, meeting existing and future needs and able to meet the Union's political priorities, including climate change and security and defence; maximise socio-economic benefits, including by promoting the widest possible use of data, information and services provided by programme components; strengthen the security of the Union and its Member States, its freedom of action and its strategic autonomy; promote the Union’s role on the international stage as a leading actor in the space sector. The programme shall have the following specific objectives: Galileo and EGNOS : to provide of state-of-the-art and, where appropriate, secure positioning, navigation and timing services. The programme shall continue to invest in operations and infrastructure to complement and maintain the satellite constellation, improve signal precision to provide positioning information for autonomous and connected vehicles, railways, aviation and other sectors, and encourage the market introduction of satellite navigation services; Copernicus : to deliver accurate and reliable Earth Observation data and information, supplied on a long-term basis, to support the implementation and monitoring of the Union and its Member States' policies in the fields of the environment, climate change, agriculture and rural development, civil protection, safety and security, as well as the digital economy; Space Situational Awareness (SSA) : to enhance SST capabilities to monitor, track and identify space objects which helps avoid collisions in space and monitors the re-entry of space objects to Earth, to monitor space weather and to map and network Member States near Earth object capacities; GOVSATCOM : to ensure the long-term availability of reliable, secure and cost-effective satellite communications services, to enhance the operational effectiveness of security actors and safeguard citizens' rights to security, to diplomatic or consular protection, and to protection of personal data. The programme shall also: (i) contribute, where this is required for the needs of the Programme, to an autonomous, secure and cost-efficient capability to access space; (ii) support and reinforce the competitiveness, entrepreneurship, skills and capacity to innovate of legal and natural persons from the Union active or wishing to become active in that sector, with particular regard to the position and needs of small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups. Governance : the proposal clarifies the relations between the various players involved and the role of these players, mainly the Member States, the Commission and the European Union Agency for Space, and by establishing a unified system of governance for all the components of this programme. It enhances the role of the former European GNSS Agency by expanding the scope of its tasks as regards security accreditation to include all the components of the Programme, thus justifying a change of name for this agency, which is to become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme. Lastly, it specifies and standardises the security framework for the Programme, particularly as regards the principles to be respected, procedures to be followed and measures to be taken, which is of crucial importance, given the dual use nature of the actions. The programme shares similar objectives with other Union programmes, notably Horizon Europe, InvestEU Fund, European Defence Fund and Funds under Regulation (EU) on the common provisions Regulation. Therefore, cumulative funding from those programmes should be foreseen. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 16 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027, with the following indicative breakdown: for Galileo and EGNOS : EUR 9.7 billion; for Copernicus : EUR 5.8 billion; for SSA/Govsatcom : EUR 0.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the digital single market strategy established a robust framework which must now be matched with an equally ambitious investment programme to increase the EU's international competitiveness, as well as to develop and strengthen Europe's strategic digital capacities. European Heads of State and Government identified the main pillars of a strong digital economy: cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, a world class infrastructure that includes high performance computing, digital skills, and the digital transformation of the public sector. In its resolution of 1 June 2017 on the digitising European industry, the European Parliament highlighted the importance of a common European cybersecurity approach, recognising the need to raise awareness and considered cyber-resilience as a crucial responsibility for business leaders and national and European industrial security policymakers. The digital Europe programme is a central element of the Commission's comprehensive response to the challenge of digital transformation, part of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal for 2021-2027. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the digital Europe programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021 - 2027, the forms of European Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The overall objective of the proposed programme is to support the digital transformation of the European economy and society and bring its benefits to European citizens and businesses. It shall reinforce Europe's capacities in key digital technology areas through large-scale deployment and widen their diffusion and uptake in areas of public interest and the private sector. The programme has five specific objectives: 1. high-performance computing : funding aims to build-up and strengthen the EU's high performance computing (HPC) and data processing capacities, and ensure their wide use both in areas of public interest such as health, environment and security, and by industry, notably SMEs. At EU level, in March 2017, 29 countries engaged to cooperate on connected mobility, and 16 Member States have committed so far to work together and with the Commission to acquire and deploy an integrated world-class high performance computing infrastructure. In January 2018, the Commission proposed a Council Regulation to establish the European High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking ‘EuroHPC’. The continuation of the Joint Undertaking is deemed to be the most effective instrument to implement the objectives of the EuroHPC initiative, in particular to coordinate national and European Union strategies and investments in high performance computing infrastructure and R&D; 2. cybersecurity : the programme shall contribute to the protection of the EU digital economy, society and democracies by promoting the EU cyber defence and cyber security industry, financing advanced cyber security equipment and infrastructure, and supporting the development of the necessary skills and knowledge. 3. artificial intelligence : the aim is to build-up and reinforce core artificial intelligence (AI) capacities such as a data resources and libraries of artificial intelligence algorithms and make them accessible to all businesses and public administrations, as well as reinforce and foster links between existing artificial intelligence testing and experimentation facilities in Member States; 4. advanced digital skills : the programme shall ensure that the current and future labour force can easily acquire advanced digital skills, notably in high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, by offering students, graduates, and existing workers the means to acquire and develop these skills, no matter where they are situated; 5. deployment, better use of digital capacities and interoperability : the objective is to expand the best use of digital capacities, notably high performance computing, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity, across the economy, in areas of public interest and society, including the deployment of interoperable solutions in areas of public interest and facilitate access to technology and knowhow for all businesses, notably SMEs. Digital innovation hubs : the proposal foresees a central role for digital innovation hubs in the implementation of the programme. A network of digital innovation hubs shall ensure the widest geographical coverage across Europe. The digital innovation hubs shall serve as access points to the latest digital capacities, including high performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, as well as other innovative technologies such as key enabling technologies, also available also in fablabs or citylabs. They shall act as single-entry points in accessing tested and validated technologies and promote open innovation.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fiscalis 2020 programme and its predecessors have significantly contributed to facilitating and enhancing cooperation between tax authorities within the Union. The added value of those programmes, including as regards the protection of the financial and economic interests of Member States of the Union and of taxpayers, has been recognised by the tax authorities of the participating countries. The Union and the national tax authorities still suffer from insufficient capacity and insufficient cooperation – both within the EU and with third countries – to carry out effectively and efficiently their missions. They need to provide quick and joint responses to emerging problems such as tax fraud, tax evasion and tax avoidance, digitalisation and new business models, while at the same time preventing unnecessary administrative burden for citizens and businesses in cross-border transactions. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a new fiscalis programme under the Single Market, Innovation and Digital budget heading. It shall comprise means and a budget which shall support tax policy and tax authorities through administrative and IT capacity building activities and operational cooperation. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the fiscalis programme for cooperation in the field of taxation for the period 2021-2027, which will succeed the Fiscalis 2020 programme. Objective : the programme has the general objective to support tax authorities and taxation to enhance the functioning of the single market, foster Union competitiveness and protect the financial and economic interests of the Union and its Member States. It supports tax policy, tax cooperation and administrative capacity building, including human competency and the development and operation of the European electronic systems. The programme shall be open to participation by Member States, acceding, candidate and potential candidate countries. The implementation of the programme will occur through the most commonly used spending mechanisms of Union budget, namely public procurement and grants. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation provides mechanisms, means as well as the necessary funding aiming to support tax policy and to improve cooperation between tax authorities. The proposed measure comprises inter alia meetings and similar ad-hoc events, project-based structured collaboration and human competency and capacity building actions, in which Member States and their officials may participate on a voluntary basis. IT capacity : the proposal provides an improved framework and governance for the IT capacity building actions carried out under the programme. An improved definition of common components and national components reflecting better the reality of IT projects and their features has been integrated. The tasks incumbent on the Commission on the one hand, and the Member States on the other hand, have been listed A multi-annual strategic plan for taxation to be drawn up by the Commission, in partnership with the Member States, shall allow for a better planning of budgetary and human resources both at national and EU level. The Commission and the Member States shall ensure jointly the development and operation, including the design, specification, conformance testing, deployment, maintenance, evolution, security, quality assurance and quality control, of the European electronic systems listed in the multi-annual strategic plan for taxation. Proposed budget : under the proposed new multiannual financial framework, the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 270 million (in current prices) for the period 2021-2027. The vast majority of the proposed budget will be spent on IT capacity building activities."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is a global leader in environmental protection and climate action. The Commission considers the shift towards a clean, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy to be a priority. The programme for the environment and climate action (LIFE), established by Regulation (EU) No 1293/2013 for the period 2014 to 2020, is the latest in a series of Union programmes over 25 years which support the implementation of environmental and climate legislation and policy priorities. Through its catalytic role, the programme supports small scale actions intended to initiate, expand or promote sustainable production, distribution and consumption practices, as well as to protect natural heritage. The Commission considers that this approach should be continued in the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. An enhanced LIFE programme would play an important role in developing climate action and clean energy investments across Europe. It would also help the EU meet its climate objectives and commitments under the Paris Agreement and the UN’s sustainable development goals. The Commission proposal for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework set a more ambitious goal for climate mainstreaming across all EU programmes, with an overall target of 25% of EU expenditure contributing to climate objectives. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the environment and climate action programme (LIFE). It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, as well as the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Programme objectives : the proposed programme aims to achieve the Union’s objectives as set out in international environmental, climate and clean energy legislation, policy, plans and commitments. Its overall objective is to contribute to the shift towards: a clean, circular, energy-efficient, low-carbon and climate-resilient economy, including a transition to clean energy; protecting and improving the quality of the environment; halting and reversing biodiversity loss, including in marine ecosystems, so as to contribute to sustainable development. In particular, the new LIFE programme shall: mobilise investment and support energy efficiency activities, particularly in European regions lagging behind in the shift towards clean energy; support projects promoting best practice in relation to nature protection and biodiversity, as well as ‘strategic nature protection projects’ for all Member States, including measures to protect the marine environment; contribute to the transition to a circular economy model through financial support targeting a variety of actors (businesses, public authorities and consumers), in particular by applying, developing, and replicating best technology, practices and solutions tailored to specific local, regional or national contexts, including through integrated approaches for the implementation of waste management and prevention plans; support the other aspects of the Union's environment policy, such as the protection and improvement of air and water quality in the EU, implementing the 2030 climate and energy policy framework and meeting the Union’s commitments under the Paris Agreement. Actions taken under the programme are expected to contribute 61 % of the overall financial envelope of the programme to climate objectives. The Commission proposes to simplify the programme management procedures and allow for a wider geographical access. Synergies would be developed with the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, Horizon Europe, the Connecting Europe Facility and InvestEU. Proposed budget : EUR 5.45 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027. The indicative breakdown of this amount is as follows: Environment : EUR 3.5 billion of which: (i) EUR 2.15 billion for the Nature and Biodiversity sub-programme; (ii) EUR 1.35 billion for the Circular Economy and Quality of Life sub-programme; Climate action : EUR 1.95 billion of which: (i) EUR 950 million for the sub-programme Climate change mitigation and adaptation; (ii) EUR 1 billion for the sub-programme clean energy transition."

BACKGROUND: the Union is a community of law, and its values constitute the very basis of its existence. These values are enshrined in the EU Treaties, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. To promote common European values and rights, the EU has combined several instruments in a policy mix of legislation, policies and funding. In particular, the following funding programmes have showed a strong societal focus and are clearly related to European values: the rights, equality and citizenship programme, the Europe for citizens programme, and the justice programme. These programmes have led to real progress in promoting values and implementing the rights that EU legislation grant to people across the Union. However, the fragmented nature and limited resources of current EU funding programmes limits the EU’s capacity to respond to existing and new challenges. At a time where European societies are confronted with extremism, radicalism and divisions, it is more important than ever to promote, strengthen and defend justice, rights and EU values which are human rights, respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law. That is why the Commission proposes to create a new justice, rights and values fund, including the rights and values and justice programmes within the EU budget. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States – seeks to establish the justice programme. It lays down the objectives of the programme, the budget for the period 2021- 2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. This new programme, together with the rights and values programme, will be part of a new justice, rights and values fund of the EU budget that will help to sustain open, democratic, pluralist and inclusive societies. The programme has the general objective of contributing to the further development of a European area of justice based on the rule of law, on mutual recognition and mutual trust between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings. The programme has three specific objectives: to facilitate and support judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters, and to promote the rule of law including by supporting the efforts to improve the effectiveness of national justice systems and the enforcement of decision; to support and promote judicial training, with a view to fostering a common legal, judicial and rule of law culture; to facilitate effective access to justice for all and effective redress, including by electronic means, by promoting efficient civil and criminal procedures and by promoting and supporting the rights of victims of crime as well as the procedural rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. In concrete terms, the programme seeks to enhance the effectiveness of legislation by increasing knowledge, awareness and capacity of citizens, professionals and stakeholders, through supporting: information and public awareness raising , including support for national and European campaigns to inform people of their rights, as guaranteed under Union law, and how to enforce them in practice; training and capacity building for legal professionals in order to equip them with the tools to effectively put Union rights and policies into practice; cooperation at transnational level and developing mutual trust, through strengthening networks, i.e. Union-wide organisations to assist with the preparation of future initiatives in this area, as well as to promote their consistent implementation across Europe and cross-border cooperation on enforcement, for example establishing missing child alert systems, coordination of operational and cross-border anti-drug cooperation. The Commission shall ensure the European added value of all actions and activities carried out under the programme, their complementarity with Member States' activities and their compatibility with other Union activities. It shall set establish annually the funding priorities in the respective policy areas. Participation is open to all legal entities legally established in a Member State or in a participating non EU country, with no further restrictions on access to the programme. Proposed budget : the programme shall have an overall budget of EUR 305 million for the period 2021-2027."

(2) Promoting citizens' engagement and participation in the democratic life of the Union (citizens’s engagement and participation strand) : increasing citizens’ understanding of the Union, its history, cultural heritage and diversity; promoting exchange and cooperation between citizens of different countries and citizens’ civic and democratic participation. (3) Combating violence (Daphne strand) : preventing and combating all forms of violence against children, young people and women and violence against other groups at risk; and supporting and protecting the victims of such violence. The programme shall provide for and accelerate the synergies between its different specific objectives in order to increase their potential to reach citizens. To be effective, the programme shall take into account the specific nature of the different policies, their different target groups and their particular needs through tailor-made approaches. Proposed budget : the programme’s overall budget is set at EUR 641.7 million for the period 2021-2027. This amount shall be allocated as follows: EUR 408.7 million for the ‘equality and rights’ and ‘fight against violence’ strands; EUR 233 million for the citizen engagement and participation strand."

The Treaty of Lisbon has substantially modified the legal framework governing the powers conferred on the Commission by the legislator, introducing a clear distinction between powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), and the powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts). The proposed Regulation aims to adapt a series of basic instruments where the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS) applies to make them evolve into delegated acts. The European Parliament’s position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure amended the Commission's proposal to clarify that the power to adopt delegated acts would be conferred on the Commission for a period of five years. The Commission shall prepare a report on the delegation of authority no later than nine months before the end of the five-year period. The delegation of power shall be tacitly extended for periods of the same duration, unless the European Parliament or the Council objects to such an extension no later than three months before the end of each period. In a recital, Parliament pointed out that bundling and presenting empowerments that are not closely linked with each other within a single delegated act of the Commission impedes the exercise of Parliament's right of scrutiny, as it is forced to simply accept or refuse the entire delegated act, which leaves no room to express an opinion on each empowerment individually."

LEGISLATIVE ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND : the Treaty of Lisbon introduced a distinction between the following: powers delegated to the Commission to adopt non-legislative acts of general application to supplement or amend certain non-essential elements of a legislative act (delegated acts), as referred to in Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning pf the EU; and powers conferred upon the Commission to adopt acts to ensure uniform conditions for implementing legally binding Union acts (implementing acts) as referred to in Article 291 of the Treaty. The measures which may be covered by delegations of powers correspond in principle to those covered by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny established by Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC. This procedure still appears in the basic acts covered by this proposal and continues to apply in those acts until they are formally amended and adapted to the Lisbon Treaty. The Commission made three horizontal alignment legislative proposals in 2013 (Omnibus I, Omnibus II and Omnibus III). The European Parliament adopted its legislative resolutions on 25 February 2014, broadly agreeing with the proposals by the Commission. The Council, however, did not support the Commission proposals, due to the absence of stronger guarantees that Member State experts would be systematically consulted in the preparation of delegated acts. The European Parliament, the Council and the Commission subsequently agreed on a new framework for delegated acts in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making of 13 April 2016 (IAA) and acknowledged the need to align all existing legislation to the legal framework introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, they agreed on the need to give high priority to the prompt alignment of all basic acts that still refer to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny. CONTENT: the proposal aligns three basic acts to Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, these acts being: Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters; Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims; Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents), and repealing Council Regulation No 1348/2000. The alignment clauses reflect the following points in the IAA: they now provide for a clear commitment to a systematic consultation of experts from the Member States in the preparation of delegated acts. This fulfils a key condition for a successful second attempt to align the old regulatory procedure with scrutiny provisions to the Lisbon Treaty. This commitment is now explicitly included in the new standard clauses; they recognise the important role of early cooperation and exchange of views with the European Parliament in relation to delegated acts. The European Parliament must receive all documents at the same time as Member State experts, including the draft delegated acts, and the alignment clauses provide for systematic access of European Parliament experts to the meetings of Commission expert groups preparing delegated acts. Accordingly, to each basic act a number of amendments are made, and references to the regulatory procedure with scrutiny are deleted. As regards the duration of the empowerment the Commission proposes empowerments with an indeterminate duration, since the legislator has the possibility of revoking an empowerment in all cases and at any time. Acts on which individual legislative proposals have been made in the meantime are not included in the proposal. This concerns two acts in the area of justice: Regulation (EC) No. 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation (EC) No. 861/2007 establishing a European small claims procedure. These have been aligned in the meantime been aligned by Regulation (EU) 2015/2421. This proposal is linked to the proposal on adapting a number of legal acts to Article 290 and 291 of the TFEU."

The Agreement has been renewed three times, in 2004, 2009 and 2014, for an additional period of five years each time. The current Agreement expired on 20 February 2019. Both parties confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for an additional period of five years without any amendments. CONTENT: under the draft Council Decision, the renewal of the Agreement on cooperation in science and technology between the European Community and the Government of the Russian Federation for an additional period of five years would be approved on behalf of the European Union. The substance of the renewed Agreement will be identical to that of the current Agreement as discussed and agreed with the Russian counterparts. It will not create new rights and obligations for the EU, but instead it will extend in time the legal regime already existing between the Parties in the field of science and technology cooperation. The renewal of the Agreement fits within the EU's approach based on the five guiding principles to manage the EU’s current relations with Russia, agreed upon at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 14 March 2016 and confirmed at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 16 April 2018. The Agreement provides a framework to enhance people-to-people contacts and science, technology and innovation cooperation in areas of EU strategic interest in the years to come, countering the trend of decreasing intensity of scientific collaboration between EU and Russian participants."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: cybersecurity is an issue of common interest of the Union. Future security depends, among others, on enhancing technological and industrial ability to protect the Union against cyber threats, as both civilian infrastructure and military capacities rely on secure digital systems. Following the 2013 cybersecurity strategy, the Union has continued to increase its activities to meet the growing challenges of cybersecurity: in 2016, the Union adopted its first measures in the area of cybersecurity through Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council on security of network and information systems; the creation in 2016 of the Public-Private Partnership (‘cPPP’) on cybersecurity in the Union was a solid first step bringing together the research, industry and public sector communities to facilitate research and innovation in cybersecurity and within the limits of the 2014-2020 financial framework should result in good, more focused outcomes in research and innovation. It will have triggered up to EUR 1.8 billion of investment by 2020; in September 2017, the Commission and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy presented a joint Communication on ‘Resilience, Deterrence and Defence: Building strong cybersecurity for the EU’ to further reinforce the Union’s resilience, deterrence and response to cyber-attacks; at the Tallinn Digital Summit in September 2017, Heads of State and Government called on the Union to become a global leader in the field of cybersecurity by 2025. With more than 660 cyber security competence centres throughout the EU, the EU already has considerable expertise in this area. However, the efforts of the research and industry communities are fragmented, lacking alignment and a common mission, which hinders the EU's competitiveness in this field. The Commission considers that these efforts and expertise need to be pooled, networked and used in an efficient manner to reinforce and complement existing research, technology and industrial capacities at Union and national levels. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: among the main arguments in favour of the selected option were: the ability to create a real cybersecurity industrial policy by supporting activities related not only to research and development but also to market deployment; the flexibility to allow different cooperation models with the community and the network of competence centres to optimise the use of existing knowledge and resources; the ability to structure cooperation of the public and private stakeholders coming from all relevant sectors, including defence. CONTENT: this Regulation proposes to establish the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, as well as the Network of National Coordination Centres, and lays down rules for the nomination of National Coordination Centres as well as for the establishment of the Cybersecurity Competence Community. The Competence Centre : its role would be to facilitate the work of the Network of National Coordination Centres and to enhance the cybersecurity competences, by driving the cybersecurity technological agenda and facilitating access to the expertise so gathered. To this end, it would coordinate the use of cybersecurity funds under the EU's next long-term budget for the period 2021-2027 under the Digital Europe Programme and the Horizon Europe Programme. Its objectives would be: · to enhance cybersecurity capabilities, knowledge and infrastructures at the service of industries, the public sector and research communities; · to contribute to the wide deployment of the latest cyber security products and solutions across the economy; · to improve the understanding of cybersecurity and contribute to reducing skills gaps in the Union related to cybersecurity; · to contribute to the reinforcement of cybersecurity research and development in the Union; · to enhance synergies between the civilian and defence dimensions of cybersecurity. The Competence Centre would be set up as a European partnership to facilitate joint investment by the Union, Member States and/or industry. Therefore, the proposal requires Member States to contribute a commensurate amount to the actions of the Competence Centre and Network. The principal decision-making body is the Governing Board, in which all Member States take part but only those Member States which participate financially have voting rights. The Network of National Coordination Centres : each Member State would nominate a national coordination centre to lead the Network, which would focus on developing new and expanded cybersecurity capabilities and expertise. The Network would identify and support the most relevant cybersecurity projects in Member States. The Cybersecurity Competences Community : this would contribute to the mission of the Competence Centre by enhancing and disseminating cybersecurity expertise throughout the Union. It would involve a large and diverse group of actors involved in the development of cybersecurity technologies, such as research organisations, supply and demand side industries and the public sector. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the Union's contribution to the Competence Centre to cover administrative and operating costs includes the following elements: EUR 1 981 668 000 from the Digital Europe Programme, of which up to EUR 23 746 000 for administrative costs; EUR 2.8 billion from the Horizon Europe programme, including for administrative costs; this contribution will be proposed by the Commission during the legislative process and, in any case, before a political agreement is reached."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households’ access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with council. BACKGROUND: the misuse of hosting service providers by terrorist groups and their supporters to disseminate terrorist-related content in order to spread their message, radicalise and attract new recruits, as well as to facilitate and direct terrorist activities is of particular concern. Efforts at Union level to counter terrorist content online commenced in 2015 through a framework of voluntary cooperation between Member States and hosting service providers, the EU Internet Forum. The Commission proposes to complement these efforts with a clear legislative framework in order to further reduce accessibility to terrorist content online and adequately address a rapidly evolving problem. This legislative framework seeks to build on voluntary efforts, which were reinforced by the Commission Recommendation (EU) 2018/334 and responds to calls made by the European Parliament in its resolution of 15 June 2017 to strengthen measures to tackle illegal and harmful content and by the European Council to improve the automatic detection and removal of content that incites to terrorist acts. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the impact assessment concluded that a series of measures were needed to achieve the strategic objective of reducing online terrorist content. Three main options were considered, in addition to the baseline scenario, with increasing degrees of effectiveness in achieving the objectives set in the impact assessment. CONTENT: the draft regulation aims to increase the effectiveness of current measures to detect, identify and remove terrorist content online without encroaching on fundamental rights, such as freedom of expression and information. In specific terms, the proposal: defines terrorist content as material and information that incites, encourages or advocates the commission or contribution to terrorist offences, provides instructions for the commission of such offences or promotes the participation in activities of a terrorist group; provides for duties of care to be applied by hosting service providers when taking action in accordance with the regulation and in particular, with due regard to the fundamental rights involved; requires Member States to empower competent authorities to issue removal orders and lays down a requirement for hosting service providers to remove content within one hour of the receipt of a removal order; sets out the minimum elements referrals should contain and procedures for hosting service providers to give feedback to the issuing authority, and to inform the latter if it is not possible to comply with the order or if further clarification is required; requires hosting service providers, where appropriate, to take proactive measures commensurate with the level of risk and to remove terrorist material from their services, including deploying automated detection tools; requires hosting service providers to: (i) preserve removed content and related data for six months for review proceedings and for investigative purposes; (ii) explain their policies against terrorist content and to publish annual transparency reports on the actions taken in this regard; (iii) put in place specific safeguards and remedies to ensure that users can challenge the deletion of their content; requires Member States to ensure that competent authorities have sufficient capability and resources to combat online terrorist content and to cooperate with each other and, where appropriate, with Europol, to avoid duplicating work and any interference with ongoing investigations; provides for the establishment of points of contact by both hosting service providers and Member States to facilitate communication between them, particularly in relation to referrals and removal orders; requires hosting service providers which do not have an establishment within any Member State but which do offer services within the Union, to designate a legal representative in the Union; specifies that Member States should lay down rules on penalties for non-compliance and provides criteria for Member States to take into account when determining the type and level of penalties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLEOF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides, in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission recalls that the right of EU citizens and their families to move freely and reside in any EU country is one of the four fundamental freedoms enshrined in the EU Treaties. Free movement of persons would not be possible unless the social security rights of mobile Europeans and their family members were protected. In all, it is estimated that: 3.7 million of Europeans are economically inactive mobile citizens; nearly 80 000 mobile citizens are entitled to long-term care benefits, totalling EUR 793 million (0.4% of the total EU expenditure on long-term care benefits); some 27 300 persons within the EU export their unemployment benefit to another Member State; there are 91 700 unemployed cross-border workers per year, 53 500 of whom are frontier workers. This initiative is part of the European Commission's labour mobility package of 2016. Its objective is to continue the process of modernisation of the EU law on social security coordination set out in Regulations (EC) No 883/2004 and No 987/2009, by further facilitating the exercise of citizens' rights while ensuring legal clarity, a fair and equitable distribution of the financial burden among the Member States and administrative simplicity and enforceability of the rules. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Commission’s preferred options include the following: to amend the current equal treatment provisions with regard to the access of economically inactive citizens to social benefits; the establishment of a coherent regime for long-term care benefits; new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases (aggregation of periods of insurance; the export of unemployment benefits; paying unemployment benefits to frontier workers); the coordination of family benefits intended to replace income during child-raising periods. CONTENT: the proposal focuses on four areas of coordination where improvements are required: (i) economically inactive citizens' access to social benefits, (ii) long-term care benefits, (iii) unemployment benefits and (iv) family benefits. Each Member State is free to determine the features of its own social security system - which benefits are provided, the conditions for eligibility, how these benefits are calculated and what contributions should be paid, and for all social security branches (old age, unemployment and family benefits), provided that such national provisions respect the principles of EU law in particular concerning equal treatment and non-discrimination. Access to social benefits claimed by economically inactive EU mobile citizens: further to recent case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, the proposal specifies that access to social security benefits for economically inactive mobile citizens in the host Member State, may be made conditional upon that citizen holding a legal right of residence in that Member State in accordance with Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The proposal clearly distinguishes an economically inactive citizen from a jobseeker whose right of residence is conferred directly by Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Long-term care benefits: the proposed revision aims to establish a coherent regime for the coordination of long-term care benefits (currently dealt with under the sickness chapter) by introducing a separate Chapter for their coordination in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, by including a definition and providing for a list of those benefits. Unemployment benefits: the proposal sets out new arrangements for the coordination of unemployment benefits in cross-border cases. The proposal: requires a minimum qualifying period of three months insurance in the Member State of most recent activity before a right to aggregate past periods of insurance arises (while requiring the Member State of previous activity to provide benefits when this condition is not fulfilled); extends the minimum period for an export of unemployment benefits from three to six months while providing for the possibility of exporting the benefit for the whole period of entitlement. The aim is to improve the opportunities for unemployed persons moving to another Member State to look for work and their chances for reintegration into the labour market and to address skills mismatches across borders; makes the Member State of most recent employment responsible for the payment of unemployment benefits when the frontier worker has worked there for at least 12 months and otherwise attributing the responsibility to the Member State of residence. Child benefits : the proposal aims to change the current coordination provisions so that child-raising allowances are considered individual and personal rights and to permit an optional right for the secondary competent Member State to pay the benefit in full. Posted workers : the proposal clarifies the rules on applicable legislation and the relationship between the Regulations on coordination and Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. It strengthens the administrative rules on social security coordination in the fields of information exchange and verification of the social security status of such workers in order to prevent potentially unfair practices or abuse. Technical amendments : the proposed amendments concern: (i) the prioritisation of derived rights to sickness benefits; (ii) the reimbursement of costs for medical examination; (iii) the calculation of the annual average costs in the field of sickness benefits; and (iv) the introduction of measures to facilitate identification of fraud or error in the application of the Regulations, including the introduction of a permissive ground for Member States to periodically exchange personal data. Furthermore, the procedures for recovery of unduly paid social security benefits have been revised to align them with the equivalent procedures in Directive 2010/24/EU concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in an environment marked by the emergence of new threats, such as hybrid and cyber-attacks, and the return of more conventional dangers, EU citizens and their political leaders agree that the EU should collectively take more responsibility for its security. The defence sector is largely fragmented across national borders , with considerable duplication, resulting in inefficiencies that prevent economies of scale. At the same time, the cost of defence equipment and in particular R&D costs have increased, while cooperation between Member States on investment in R&D and defence equipment has remained limited. In 2015, only 16% of defence equipment was procured through European collaborative procurement. In June 2017, the Commission adopted a communication launching the European Defence Fund consisting of 'windows' for research and for capability. The communication was accompanied by a legislative proposal for a Regulation establishing the European defence industrial development programme under the capability window. A two-step approach was proposed, involving: an initial test period under the 2014-2020 multi-annual financial framework during which a preparatory action on defence research supports collaborative defence research, while the proposed European defence industrial development programme shall co-finance collaborative development projects; and a dedicated fund under the 2021-2027 multi-annual financial framework scaling up the funding for collaborative research in innovative defence products and technologies and for subsequent stages of the development cycle, including the development of prototypes. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - concerns the establishment of the European defence fund under the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 with a view to fostering the competitiveness and innovation capacity of the European defence industry and technological base and thus contributing to the strategic autonomy of the Union. The new fund shall promote cooperation between Member States and contribute to cost savings in the production of interoperable and advanced defence technologies and equipment. Its objective shall be: support collaborative research projects that could significantly boost the performance of future capabilities, aiming at maximising innovation and introducing new defence products and technologies, including disruptive ones; support collaborative development projects of defence products and technologies consistent with defence capability priorities commonly agreed by Member States within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. It shall contribute to greater efficiency of defence spending within the Union, achieving greater economies of scale, reducing the risk of unnecessary duplication and as such reducing the fragmentation of defence products and technologies throughout the Union. Eligible actions : the proposed Regulation shall enable the Commission to set up a financing programme, implemented mainly through grants awarded following annual calls for proposals. Cross-border participation of SMEs and mid-cap companies shall be encouraged by offering higher financing rates. To be eligible, actions shall, in principle, be carried out in cooperation between at least three legal entities based in at least three different Member States and/or associated countries. Furthermore, the EU shall only co-finance the development of common prototypes if Member States commit themselves to buying the final product. Once assessed as eligible, a 'PESCO bonus', in the form of a higher funding rate, shall be granted to eligible permanent structured cooperation in defence projects. The fund shall also take into account defence activities implemented through the European peace facility, an off-budget instrument proposed outside the multi-annual financial framework. Proposed budget : the Fund shall have an overall budget of EUR 13 billion (at current prices) for the period 2021-2027, of which: Up to 5% of the financial envelope shall be devoted to support disruptive technologies for defence."
