PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union using the procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council for the duration of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. It was established to enable the Union to show solidarity towards workers who lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. After analysing the risks, the European Commission concluded that this proposal was necessary to ensure an effective response from the EGF and to show solidarity with workers made redundant in the Union as a result of a withdrawal from the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement. CONTENT: the proposed contingency Regulation should amend Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 in order to specify that redundancies resulting from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement fall within the scope of the EGF. Such a withdrawal would represent a major change in the EU's trade relations and the structure of the internal market and would therefore probably have significant repercussions on business models, growth and employment. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and should apply from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply in the United Kingdom. However, it should not apply if a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 50(2) TEU has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union using the procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The Withdrawal Agreement contains arrangements for the application of provisions of Union law to and in the United Kingdom beyond the date the Treaties cease to apply to and in the United Kingdom. If that agreement enters into force, the common fisheries policy (CFP) will apply to and in the United Kingdom during the transition period in accordance with that agreement and will cease to apply at the end of that period. Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets out the rules for issuing and managing fishing authorisations for vessels in waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of a third country and for third country fishing vessels conducting fishing operations in Union waters. Regulation (EU) 2019/498 of the European Parliament and of the Council amended Regulation (EU) 2017/2403, adopted un March 2019 with a date of application until 31 December 2019. It provides a simplified legal framework to allow the Union to grant authorisations to United Kingdom vessels to enter Union waters and to manage authorisation requests for EU vessels entering United Kingdom waters, should reciprocal access rights to waters be confirmed and in line with the applicable rules on fishing opportunities. Such a temporary framework remains necessary for 2020 in the absence of a fisheries agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom in its new status of third country, and taking into account that the United Kingdom will not be part of Union decision making beyond the Commission Proposal on fishing opportunities (scheduled for October 2019) unless a new extension of the Article 50(3) period is requested by the United Kingdom and agreed by the European Council (Article 50). CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the period of application of these provisions to enable the issuance of fishing authorisations in each other’s waters in absence of a fisheries agreement concluded with the United Kingdom as a third country, provided that the management of the relevant stocks remains sustainable and in accordance with the conditions set out in the common fisheries policy and in the Council Regulations establishing fishing opportunities. Should the Withdrawal Agreement not be ratified by 31 October 2019, and should the United Kingdom withdraw from the Union on 1 November 2019, it may not be feasible for the United Kingdom and the Union to conclude a common arrangement on the fishing opportunities for relevant stocks concerned for 2020 in time for the meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers in December 2019 which is scheduled to set the fishing opportunities for the following year. The absence of a common arrangement however does not as such prevent the United Kingdom and the Union from granting access to each other’s waters. In that case, they would be able to issue fishing authorisations to each other's vessels provided they both meet the conditions for sustainable management of the relevant stocks. United Kingdom fishing vessels may carry out fishing operations in Union waters in accordance with the conditions set out in the Council Regulations establishing fishing opportunities for 2019 and 2020, provided that the fishing opportunities set by both the Union and the United Kingdom combined are in line with the sustainable management of the relevant stocks in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013. The territorial scope of this Regulation and any reference to the United Kingdom therein does not include Gibraltar. This Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency and should apply from the day following that on which the Treaties cease to apply to the United Kingdom, unless a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom has entered into force by that date. It should apply until 31 December 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: this Council draft is part of the Union preparedness and contingency plan to mitigate the most significant disruptions of a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement. The United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom are participating in a number of Union programmes or actions on the basis of the United Kingdom’s membership in the Union. The participation takes place on the basis of agreements with the United Kingdom or persons or entities established in the United Kingdom or decisions in favour of the United Kingdom or persons or entities established in the United Kingdom which constitute legal commitments. In case of a withdrawal without a withdrawal agreement, it would be beneficial both for the Union and its Member States and for the United Kingdom, and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom, to provide for the eligibility in 2020 of the United Kingdom and beneficiaries established in the United Kingdom to receive Union funds and for the participation of the United Kingdom in the financing of the budget for 2020. It would also be beneficial if the legal commitments signed and adopted before the date of withdrawal, or in 2019 in application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197, could continue to be executed throughout 2020. CONTENT: the draft Council defines the conditions under which the United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom may continue to be eligible in 2020 with regard to agreements signed with them and decisions adopted with regard to them until the date of withdrawal or, where applicable, in 2019 pursuant to the contingency Regulation (Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197). The application of the proposed Regulation is subject to the following conditions: - the United Kingdom has confirmed the commitment in writing to the Commission to continue to pay a contribution calculated on the basis of the estimated own resources from the United Kingdom as set out in the draft budget for 2020 and adjusted to take into account the total amount of payment appropriations set out in the adopted budget for 2020; - a first instalment has been paid by the United Kingdom; - the United Kingdom has confirmed the commitment in writing to the Commission to allow audits and controls in full by the Union in compliance with the applicable rules. As long as the conditions for eligibility of the United Kingdom, and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom continue to be fulfilled, their eligibility should be ensured in 2020 for the purposes of conditions set in calls, tenders, contests or any other procedure which may lead to financing from the Union’s budget, with the exception of specific cases relating to security and the loss of the United Kingdom’s status as a member of the European Investment Bank, and to provide Union funding to them. Such Union funding should be limited to eligible expenditure incurred in 2020, except for public procurement contracts signed before the end of 2020 in application of Title VII of the Financial Regulation, which continue to be implemented in accordance with their terms, and except for the United Kingdom agricultural direct payment scheme for the claim year 2020, which should be excluded from eligibility. The draft regulation also provides for: - the continued eligibility of the United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom provided that the United Kingdom continues to pay the contribution for 2020 and, where applicable, for 2019 under Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197 and that controls and audits can be carried out effectively; - the continuation, in 2020, of the eligibility of actions under which Member States or persons or entities established in Member States receive funds from the Union and which are related to the United Kingdom. As it lays down measures for the implementation and financing of the Union's budget for 2020, the proposed Regulation should only concern eligibility for the 2020 financial year."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to prepare for the possibility that the United Kingdom could withdraw from the Union without an agreement on 30 March 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/501 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) 2019/502 of the European Parliament and of the Council were adopted to ensure basic road freight and road passenger and basic air connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom. Regulation (EU) 2019/501 and Regulation (EU) 2019/502 shall cease to apply on 31 December 2019 and 30 March 2020 respectively. Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. In order to address the impact of the new timeline for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union, the period of application of those Regulations should be extended, taking into account the core principles underlying contingency measures and their originally intended periods of application. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the period of validity of Regulations (EU) 2019/501 and (EU) 2019/502 by seven months, which corresponds to the duration of the extension of the period referred to in Article 50(3) of the TEU. Therefore, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 2019/501 should cease to apply on 31 July 2020 rather than on 31 December 2019. In addition, in order to ensure that the option provided for in Article 2(3)(d) of Regulation (EU) 2019/501 is available for a meaning period of the same order as that initially provided for, it is necessary to define the period during which cabotage services in the field of road passenger transport may be provided in the border region of Ireland as a six-month period starting from the date of application of that Regulation. This rule should replace the current reference to the date of cessation of application of 30 September 2019. As regards Regulation (EU) 2019/502, the proposal sets 24 October 2020, the end of IATA's 2020 summer season, as the date of cessation of its application. The 12-month period of application initially envisaged would thus be preserved."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union, invoking the procedure set out in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The EUSF was created in 2002 to support EU Member States and accession countries in situations of major disasters caused by natural events such as floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires or drought. The Fund can be mobilised upon an application from the concerned country if the disaster event has a dimension justifying intervention at European level. While it will be a singular event, its disruptive effects and the burden thereof on public finances, directly imputable to the event of a withdrawal without an agreement, could constitute a major disaster and therefore the activation of the “solidarity principle”, which is the core of the EUSF, would be justified in order to mitigate those effects. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in order to extend its scope to certain types of additional public expenditure caused by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union without agreement. Scope and eligibility Under the amending Regulation, the notion of 'major disasters' would cover natural disasters as well as situations where serious financial burden is inflicted on a Member State as a direct consequence of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement. The Commission proposes to take the financial burden on Member States’ budgets in order to face the additional needs stemming from and directly linked to a withdrawal without an agreement as the reference to determine eligibility. Access to the EUSF would be determined by a minimum level of public expenditure related to the withdrawal without agreement set at 0.3% of GNI or EUR 1.5 billion (whichever is lower), at 2011 prices, half the threshold for natural disasters. It is for the Member State to provide evidence for that expenditure and to demonstrate that it is directly imputable to the withdrawal without agreement. Such assistance may be used, for example, to provide support to businesses affected by the withdrawal without an agreement, including support to State aid measures for those businesses and related interventions; measures to preserve existing employment; and to ensure the functioning of border, customs, sanitary and phytosanitary controls, including additional personnel and infrastructure. VAT shall not constitute eligible expenditure. Procedure The competent national authorities of a Member State could submit to the Commission, by 30 April 2020 at the latest, a single application for a financial contribution from the Fund. The application should include at least all relevant information on the financial burden borne by that Member State. Where the Commission concludes that the conditions for granting a financial contribution from the Fund are met, it should without delay submit to the European Parliament and the Council the necessary proposals to trigger the intervention of the Fund and authorise the corresponding appropriations. When submitting an application for a financial contribution from the Fund to the Commission for serious financial burden caused by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement, a Member State may request the payment of an advance. The Commission therefore proposes to raise the level of advance payments for individual disasters of all categories to 25% of the expected EUSF contribution, limited to a maximum of EUR 100 million. It also proposes to increase the total level of appropriations for EUSF advances in the annual budget from EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in order to maintain the availability of the EUSF for major natural disasters, which is its original purpose, the use of the EUSF for the purpose of the present proposal should be limited to a maximum of 50% of its annual available amount in 2019 and 2020. The maximum annual allocation of the EUSF is EUR 500 million in 2011 prices. In current prices this means EUR 585.8 million for 2019 plus EUR 597.5 million for 2020, i.e. a total of EUR 1 183.3 million. Up to EUR 591.65 million would therefore be available for the purpose of the current proposal."

BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, entered into force on 1 September 2017. A new type of poultry cut consists of a traditional breast cap with the humerus bones of the wings attached and can, after minimal transformation in the Union, be marketed in the Union as poultry breast. Unlimited imports of those cuts, of which imports from Ukraine reached 55 500 tons in 2018, therefore risk undermining the conditions under which traditional poultry breast cuts may be imported into the Union under the Association Agreement, in particular the quantitative restrictions in the form of a tariff rate quota. On 20 December 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Ukraine with a view to finding a solution by amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement. Those negotiations were successfully concluded on 19 March 2019.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the European Union and the United States concluded a Memorandum of Understanding, revised in 2014, which provided an interim solution to a long-standing dispute in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over imports of US beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. Under the agreement, a 45 000 tonnes quota of non-hormone treated beef was open by the EU to qualifying suppliers. Under WTO rules the quota also had to be made available to non-US suppliers. On 19 October 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations between the EU and the United States on the functioning of the tariff quota. Negotiations with the United States were concluded on 27 February 2019. The signed agreement, subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the EU and the United States on the allocation to the United States of a share in the tariff quota for high-quality beef referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding on the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain EU products, which was concluded in 2009 and revised in 2014. Under the new agreement, the existing quota will remain unchanged but 35 000 out of the total 45 000-tonne TRQ will be ring-fenced for the United States and phased in over a period of 7 years. The autonomous tariff quotas will continue to cover only products complying with EU's high food safety and health standards.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Jordan relations are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Jordan signed an Association Agreement with the Union on 24 November 1997, which entered into force on 1 May 2002. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan. The Jordanian economy has been particularly affected by the conflict that has been raging in Syria since 2011. This regional unrest has caused a considerable deterioration in external revenues and strained public finances. They have affected tourism and foreign direct investment. Regardless of these conflicts, the supply of natural gas from Egypt has been disrupted for several years. In addition, the Jordanian economy has faced a massive influx of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on public finances, public services and infrastructure. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2.1 billion to Jordan under different instruments (including EUR 380 million under the two aforementioned MFA programmes) to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address its related humanitarian, development and security needs. In addition, the European Investment Bank has allocated around EUR 486 million in project loans to Jordan. A recent evaluation of the implementation of MFA operations concluded that the first MFA programme was adapted to Jordan's economic challenges and in line with EU priorities. The evaluation also found that the programme had been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities, had contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability and has had a positive social impact. In July 2019, given its still difficult economic situation and prospects, Jordan requested further macro-financial assistance from the Union. In this context, the Commission considers that the continued support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Jordan's international partners, of which the EU remains essential. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to provide Jordan with additional macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 500 million in three instalments in the form of medium and long-term loans. The EU MFA is an exceptional emergency aid instrument designed to respond to serious balance of payments difficulties in third countries. The objective of the proposed MFA is to help Jordan cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2020-2021, reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities as well as contributing to the debt sustainability. In addition, EU assistance would encourage Jordan to step up its reform efforts through a Memorandum of Understanding, to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities and shall include a package of measures to promote economic adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms. MFA funds shall be made available in the form of low-interest and long-term loans. Disbursements under the proposed programme shall be strictly conditional on the implementation of specific conditions, to be agreed between the EU and Jordan and set out in a Memorandum of Understanding. These conditions should be in line not only with the priorities of the EU-Jordan Partnership, as confirmed at the Brussels III Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region, held from 12 to 14 March 2019, and at the EU-Jordan Association Council on 17 July 2019, but also with the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to conclusion of the agreement. The ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013) allowed for the consultation of Eurodac by law enforcement authorities for the purpose of prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. Since 2004, the Agreement between the European Community and the Switzerland concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland also covers the application of the ‘Dublin-related’ parts of Eurodac. This is also the case for Liechtenstein since 2008. However, law enforcement access, which was a new element of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation compared to the original Eurodac regime (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) has not been regulated so far by the said Agreement. Therefore, Members called on the European Parliament to give its consent to the extension of the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to Switzerland and Liechtenstein which would enable the law enforcement authorities of Switzerland and Liechtenstein to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by other participating States and stored in the Eurodac database when they seek to establish the identity or get further information concerning a person who is suspected of a serious crime or terrorism or concerning a victim."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, which establishes a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement, was signed in London on 30 July 2009. The Interim Partnership Agreement has been provisionally applied by Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa since 20 December 2009, 28 July 2014 and 31 December 2018, respectively. The Agreement lays down the provisions regarding the accession of other Pacific Island States. In accordance with the Agreement, Solomon Islands submitted to the Council on 4 June 2018 an application for membership and an offer of market access. The Commission examined Solomon Islands' offer and, after modifications, has found it acceptable. Accordingly, the Commission concluded negotiations with Solomon Islands on 23 October 2018. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of Solomon Islands' accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Union, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, subject to the deposit of the Act of Accession by Solomon Islands. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Solomon Islands and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Solomon Islands' exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Solomon Islands from paying customs duties. Indeed, the EPA covers 90.3% of tariff lines, or 83% of the EU's export volume over 15 years. The Agreement also contains provisions on sustainable development. In accordance with the Agreement, the Union and Solomon Islands are to apply the Agreement on a provisional basis ten days after they have notified each other in writing that the necessary procedures have been completed."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in relation to the financing of the CAP, certain amendments of Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Horizontal Regulation) are needed to ensure that the financial discipline mechanism that makes it possible to respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation on the multi-annual financial framework can still operate for financial years post 2020. In relation to Direct Payments, Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amended Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (Direct Payments Regulation) to extend the flexibility between pillars foreseen for calendar years 2015-2019 to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. This regulation sets up the amounts to transfer from the rural development to direct payments envelope as a percentage of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU. The relevant Union legislation may not be in place by the time the Member States need to notify their decision to transfer. To make it possible to apply the flexibility from rural development to direct payments, it is appropriate to establish the maximum amount that can be transferred based on a fixed amount and not a percentage. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulations (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to ensure the continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a transitional period of one year from 2014-2020 until the rules on CAP strategic plans are applied, in line with the Commission's proposal on support for CAP strategic plans. Update of the reference for determining a financial discipline rate Expenditure under the EAGF within a given financial year shall respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For that purpose, the said Regulation provides for the determination of a financial discipline adjustment rate. However, currently the relevant provisions refer to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 which only sets the relevant ceilings for the period 2014-2020. To ensure that the ceiling for the financing of market related expenditure and direct payments post 2020 will also be respected, the legal reference of Articles 16 and 26 should be amended to include the regulation to be adopted by the Council for financial year 2021 onwards. Change of the basis for notifying the transfer from rural development to direct payments To ensure continuity in the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between the two pillars, already decided by the colegislators in Regulation (EU) 2019/288, the Commission proposed to replace the percentage of transfer by maximum absolute amounts based on the current maximum percentages. Member States had the possibility to review by 1 August 2019 the percentage of their national ceiling for direct payments, which they want to allocate to Voluntary Coupled Support (VCS), as well as their detailed support decisions (i.e. list of support measures and their envelopes, targeting, etc.). This review, if any, will apply from claim year 2020. In addition, Member States will have to notify only by 31 December 2019 or shortly thereafter their transfers between pillars affecting their national ceiling for direct payments for calendar year 2020. Budgetary implications The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. For market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans, for financial year 2021. The amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 ensure that a financial discipline adjustment rate can be determined in financial years 2021 and onwards where the expenditure forecasts for the measures financed under the EAGF net ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings would be exceeded. Thereby, the amendment potentially decreases expenditure under EAGF to the maximum level agreed for the fund in the multiannual financial framework. The amendment of the flexibility provision for calendar year 2020 (financial year 2021) is a technical adjustment to ensure applicability of the provision and does not have any financial implications compared to those intended for the existing provision. The review option for the voluntary coupled support may lead to financial reallocations between measures within the Member States but these will remain within the national ceiling and as such do not require additional financing."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol. As a reminder, the Eurodac Regulation (recast) (Regulation (EU) No 603/2013) enables law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac in order to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. Since 2001, the Agreement between the European Community and Iceland and Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway also covers the application of the ‘Dublin-related’ parts of Eurodac. However, law enforcement access, which was a new element of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation compared to the original Eurodac regime (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) has not been regulated so far by the said Agreement. The negotiations on an agreement between the European Union, on the one part, and Iceland and Norway, on the other part, on the modalities of the participation by Iceland and Norway to the procedure for comparison and data transmission for law enforcement purposes foreseen in chapter VI of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation have been finalised and an Agreement in the form of a Protocol to the Agreement of 19 January 2001, extending the application of the Agreement of 19 January 2001 to law enforcement was initialled. The extension of the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to Iceland and Norway would: - enable the law enforcement authorities of Iceland and Norway to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by other participating States and stored in the Eurodac database when they seek to establish the identity or get further information concerning a person who is suspected of a serious crime or terrorism or concerning a victim; - the law enforcement authorities of all other participating States, whether other EU Member States or Associates Countries, to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by Iceland and Norway and stored in the Eurodac database, for the same purposes."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called ‘Open Skies’ cases, on 5 June 2003, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (horizontal authorisation). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. In accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ‘horizontal authorisation’, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with China that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and China. The Agreement was signed, subject to its conclusion at a later date. CONTENT: The draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the People's Republic of China on certain aspects of air services. The purpose of the agreement is to bring existing bilateral air services agreements between 27 Member States and China into line with EU law: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause which allows all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment; - Article 4 resolves potential conflicts with EU competition rules."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. On 22 May 2017, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the United Kingdom with a view to concluding an agreement laying down the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking into account the framework of its future relations with the Union. The agreement was negotiated in the light of the European Council's guidelines and in accordance with the Council's negotiating directives and with the European Parliament's resolutions of 5 April 2017 , 3 October 2017, 13 December 2017 and 14 March 2018. On 14 November 2018, negotiators for the European Commission and the United Kingdom reached agreement on the full withdrawal agreement and on the broad lines of the political declaration on future relations between the EU and the United Kingdom. An agreement on future relations between the Union and the United Kingdom can only be concluded after the United Kingdom has become a third country. However, Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union requires that the framework for future relations with the Union be taken into account in the agreement setting out the arrangements for withdrawal. The withdrawal agreement sets out the terms and conditions for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU. It ensures that the withdrawal shall be carried out in an orderly manner, and provides legal certainty once the Treaties and Union law have ceased to apply in the United Kingdom. The withdrawal agreement is necessary to mitigate any negative effects on the European economy and the Union budget, protect the rights of the European citizens living and working in the United Kingdom, as well as safeguard the goal of peace and reconciliation in the island of Ireland. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The Commission's draft text proposal for the withdrawal agreement consists of 185 articles structured in six parts, three protocols and nine annexes. The areas concerned are as follows: Part 1: Common Provisions The agreement sets out the clauses necessary to ensure the correct understanding, operation and interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. The provisions of the withdrawal agreement were clearly to have the same legal effects in the United Kingdom as in the EU and its Member States. The agreement expressly provides for this obligation, which means that both parties must ensure, in their respective legal systems, primacy and direct effect, as well as a consistent interpretation with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) prior to the end of the transitional period. Part 2: Citizens' Rights The agreement lays down provisions to safeguard the status and rights derived from Union law of EU and UK citizens, and their families, affected by the United Kingdom withdrawal. The basic conditions for residence are and will remain the same as those currently provided for under EU law on free movement. Persons covered by the withdrawal agreement will have the right to take up paid employment or engage in economic activity as self-employed workers. They will also retain all the rights they enjoy as workers under Union law. The withdrawal agreement will also protect the rights of employed or self-employed frontier workers in the countries where they work. As regards the rules on the coordination of social security systems, persons benefiting from the part of the withdrawal agreement devoted to citizens' rights will retain their rights to health care, a pension and other social security benefits. These provisions are intended to ensure a smooth termination of the current arrangements and to ensure an orderly withdrawal (for example, to allow goods placed on the market before the end of the transitional period to reach their destination, to protect existing intellectual property rights, to put an end to ongoing police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, to regulate the use of data and information exchanged before the end of the transitional period). Part 4 - Transition Period The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until the end of 2020. During this period, the full acquis of the Union will continue to apply to the United Kingdom as if it were a Member State. The United Kingdom will thus continue to be part of the EU's customs union and single market (with the four freedoms) and to participate in the Union's policies. From the date of withdrawal (i.e. including during the transitional period), the United Kingdom will no longer be represented in the Union's institutions and will no longer participate in the Union's decision-making process. During the transition period, the United Kingdom will have to comply with the EU's trade policy and will continue to be bound by the Union's exclusive competence, in particular with regard to the common trade policy. It will not be able to conclude new agreements on its own in areas of exclusive Union competence, unless it is authorised to do so by the Union. The withdrawal agreement provides for the possibility of extending the transition period. This possibility may only be used once, the decision to this effect having to be taken before 1 July 2020. Part 5: Financial Provisions Under the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom will honour its share of the financing of all obligations incurred during its membership of the Union relating to the EU budget (and in particular the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, including payments made after the end of the transitional period linked to the closure of programmes). Part 6: Institutional Provisions The agreement sets out rules for the consistent interpretation and application of the agreement and establishes a Joint Committee as well as a dispute settlement mechanism. The withdrawal agreement also provides for: - a protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland including the provisions necessary for the so-called “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This will apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by any subsequent agreement. The Protocol creates a single EU-UK customs territory. It also provides for a range of measures to ensure a level playing field between the EU and the United Kingdom. In this protocol, the United Kingdom undertakes not to reduce the rights set out in the Good Friday Agreement (Belfast Agreement) of 1998, and to protect North-South cooperation; - a Protocol on Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus , to protect the interests of Cypriots living and working in the Sovereign Base Areas after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union; - a Protocol on Gibraltar , which provides for close cooperation between Spain and the United Kingdom on Gibraltar, as regards the implementation of the provisions of the withdrawal agreement relating to citizens' rights, and which concerns administrative cooperation between the competent authorities in a number of policy areas. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only budgetary impact of the withdrawal agreement (EUR 288 million per year over 4 years) stems from the establishment of the Joint Committee which will supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the withdrawal agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). On 22 December 2009, the Council agreed on the principle of launching bilateral negotiations with individual ASEAN countries based on the authorisation and negotiating directives of 2007, whilst preserving the strategic objective of a region-to-region agreement. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in October 2013 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Vietnam an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. Vietnam has become the EU's second biggest trading partner in ASEAN after Singapore and ahead of Malaysia, with trade between the EU and Vietnam worth EUR 47.6 billion in 2017. It is one of the fastest growing countries in ASEAN. According to a study on the economic benefits to be expected from the FTA, EU exports to Vietnam are expected to increase by more than EUR 8 billion by 2035, while exports from Vietnam to the EU are expected to increase by EUR 15 billion. These estimates correspond to an increase, in relative terms, in EU exports to Vietnam of almost 29% and in exports from Vietnam to the EU of almost 18%. The EU's national income could increase by more than EUR 1.9 billion by 2035 as a result of the FTA, while Vietnam's could increase by EUR 6 billion over the same period. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Vietnam. The Agreement was signed subject to its conclusion at a later date. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured: the comprehensive liberalisation of services and investment markets, including crosscutting rules on licensing and for the mutual recognition of diplomas, and sectorspecific rules designed to ensure a level playing field for EU businesses; new tendering opportunities for EU bidders in Vietnam, who is not a member of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement; the removal of technical and regulatory trade barriers to trade in goods, such as duplicative testing, in particular by promoting the use of technical and regulatory standards familiar in the EU in the sectors of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as green technologies; based on international standards, a more trade-facilitative regime for the approval of European food exports to Vietnam; Vietnam’s commitment to reduce or eliminate its tariffs on imports from the EU, and a cheaper access of European businesses and consumers to products originating in Vietnam; a high level protection of intellectual property rights, including with regard to the enforcement of these rights, also at the border, and a TRIPs-plus level of protection of EU GIs; a comprehensive chapter on trade and sustainable development, which aims at ensuring that trade supports labour rights, environmental protection and social development and promotes the sustainable management of forests and fisheries; and a swift dispute resolution mechanisms through either panel arbitration or with the help of a mediator. The EU-Vietnam FTA and IPA include institutional provisions that lay down an implementing bodies’ structure to continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of the agreements. It establishes a Trade Committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 contains a ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule, whereby air carriers must use at least 80% of their allocated slots within a given scheduling period (summer or winter) in order to keep precedence in respect of the same series of slots within the corresponding scheduling period of the next year (so-called ‘grandfather rights’). Due to the reduced demand for passenger traffic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, air carriers have already started and will continue to cancel flights, which will result in slot usage for the winter 2019-2020 and summer 2020 scheduling periods below the 80 % threshold imposed by the Regulation. According to Eurocontrol, the number of flights fell by 10% in the first two weeks of March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Given the decreasing demand caused by the crisis, most European air carriers are grounding aircraft. European airports expect a loss of 67 million passengers in the first quarter of 2020. This phenomenon is seriously affecting air transport across the Union. On the basis of the information currently available from Eurocontrol, from air carriers and from airports, it is reasonable to assume that the current situation, characterised by an exceptional fall in demand, will last at least for the months of March, April, May and June 2020. In the absence of any measure neutralising, for the purposes of this calculation, the effects of the current circumstances, it is likely that air carriers will operate many flights with very low load factors in order to protect their grandfather rights, thus exacerbating financial losses and causing an adverse impact on the environment. CONTENT: in order to allow airlines to adapt their capacity in light of the decline in demand caused by the epidemic, and to protect the financial health of airlines and the environment, the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 in order to protect the grandfather rights of air carriers for those slots that have not been used during the period when the aviation market has been most affected by the outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19). The proposed period covers the four-month period between March 2020 and June 2020 for all flights. The proposed amendment would come in form of a rule whereby coordinators shall consider slots allocated for the reference periods in question as having been operated. This rule would mitigate the effects of the current crisis and provide legal certainty to the air carriers for the relevant parts of the scheduling periods. Any slots freed by air carriers as a result could be reallocated by coordinators according to needs. The Commission may extend the period during which the measures are applicable, if necessary by means of delegated acts. The Commission shall base such decisions on the most recent information available, published by Eurocontrol, and on relevant scientific advice. Additionally, given that the severe impact of the outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 virus became apparent first in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, it is proposed to protect during a longer overall period the grandfathering rights for slots used for air services to and from those markets. The additional period starts on 23 January 2020, the date on which the first airport in the People’s Republic of China was closed by the authorities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 epidemic crisis is hampering growth in the Member States, exacerbating the severe liquidity shortages resulting from the sharp and sudden increase in public investment needed in their health systems and other sectors of their economies. This creates an exceptional situation which needs to be addressed by specific measures. The lack of public funds in Member States should not hamper investments under programmes supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund (CF), as well as the European Fund for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (EFFAMP), which are necessary to combat the COVID-19 outbreak. In order to release funds to fight the crisis, it is necessary to rapidly mobilise cash reserves from the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESF) - the money available to the EU under the Cohesion Fund. This would make financial means available to Member States' budgets without delay. CONTENT: the Commission proposes a ‘Coronavirus response investment initiative’ to promote investment by mobilising the cash reserves available in the European Structural and Investment Funds to tackle this crisis without delay. Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 , (EU) No 1301/2013 and (EU) No 508/2014 would be amended accordingly. The proposed investment initiative consists of the following elements: Mobilisation of EUR 37 billion of European public investment The investments shall be sizeable and shall rapidly reach more than EUR 37 billion. To achieve this, the Commission proposes to release about EUR 8 billion of investment liquidity. In order to quickly direct these EUR 37 billion of European public investment to address the consequences of the coronavirus crisis, the Commission proposes to relinquish this year’s obligation to request refunding of unspent pre-financing for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund (CF) and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) until programme closure. Member States should normally have reimbursed by the end of June 2020 a total of around EUR 8 billion of unused pre-financing received for 2019. They should now be allowed to keep this money. Taking into account the average co-financing rates among Member States, this EUR 8 billion would, in combination with co-financing from the EU budget of around EUR 29 billion, mobilise a total EU budget support of EUR 37 billion. Flexibility in applying EU spending rules In order to provide more flexibility in addressing the COVID-19 outbreak, it is proposed to give more flexibility to Member States in programme implementation of programmes and to provide for a simplified procedure not requiring a Commission decision in case of modifications to operational programmes. In order to respond to the impact of the crisis: - financial instruments financed by the Funds should also provide support in the form of working capital to SMEs if necessary as a temporary measure to provide an effective response to a public health crisis; - the ERDF investment priority to strengthen research, technological development and innovation can cover investment in products and services necessary for fostering the crisis response capacities in health services; - the EMFF to safeguard the income of aquaculture producers by contributing to an aquaculture stock insurance covering economic losses due to a public health crisis. In order to provide an immediate response to the impact of the crisis, expenditure for operations for fostering crisis response capacities should be eligible as of 1 February 2020. A Task Force has been setup to coordinate work with Member States, identify their precise needs and assist them so as to ensure that the money starts flowing as soon as possible. The proposed amendment does not entail any change in the annual ceilings of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework for commitments and payments. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the ERDF, the ESF and the Cohesion Fund remains unchanged. The proposal shall facilitate the acceleration of the programme implementation resulting in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission shall carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts. The non-recovered amounts in 2020 shall be cleared at programme closure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since the first cases of the COVID-19 contagion, the EU has been working tirelessly to support the Member States and their citizens in addressing the crisis. The ARGUS crisis coordination mechanism of the Commission has been activated and a coordinating response team at political level has been established, composed of the five commissioners responsible for the most affected policies. The Commission considers it essential that the Union and its Member States act collectively to contain the spread of the virus and help patients, but also to counter the economic fallout. As part of this joint coordinated response, the EU Solidarity Fund ( EUSF ) can play an important role in showing EU solidarity to Member States in dealing with the emergency situation. The EUSF was created in 2002 to support EU Member States and accession countries in situations of major disasters caused by natural events such as floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires or drought. The EUSF may award financial assistance to eligible States totalling up to EUR 500 million in 2011 prices per year. However, the current EUSF is strictly limited to natural disasters causing physical damage and does not include major disasters due to biological hazards. It is therefore necessary to lay down provisions enabling the Union to intervene in the event of a major public health emergency such as COVID-19. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to include major public health crises in the emergencies that the EU Solidarity Fund finances with the aim of mobilising it if necessary for the most affected Member States. The proposal aims to provide financial assistance to provide immediate support in response to a request from a Member State or a candidate country. Union assistance should be complementary to the efforts of the States concerned and be used to cover a share of the public expenditure committed to dealing with the most essential emergency operations resulting from the emergency situation. The threshold for natural disasters was therefore set at direct damage exceeding 0.6% of gross national income (GNI) or EUR 3 billion (in 2011 prices), whereby the lower amount applies. In the case of major health emergencies, the Commission proposes take the financial burden on Member States’ budgets in order to face the additional needs. Accordingly, it is proposed to maintain the principles on which access to the EUSF is based. Accordingly, the lower of 0.3% of GNI or EUR 1.5 billion in 2011 prices, i.e. half of that applicable to natural disasters, are defined as the minimum level of public expenditure related to the public financial burden inflicted on the eligible State for emergency response measures. The proposal strengthens the existing provisions on the payment of advances by increasing the amounts of the advances. Specifically, the Commission proposes: - to raise the level of advance payments for individual disasters of all categories to 25% of the expected EUSF contribution, limited to a maximum of EUR 100 million; - to increase the total level of appropriations for EUSF advances in the annual budget from EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million. In order to ensure the timely availability of resources where necessary, the Commission shall propose to enter additional appropriations for a maximum of EUR 50 million in the budget for 2020. The financial envelope foreseen for the Fund also follows the existing Solidarity Fund, with an annual amount of EUR 500 million (2011 prices). The ceiling of the maximum EUSF allocation for 2020 is respected (EUR 597.546 million, plus EUR 552.978 carried over from 2019)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis caused by the COVID 19 epidemic is increasing the risks for the most vulnerable, in particular the most deprived, and may in particular disrupt the support provided by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The distribution of food and basic material assistance, as well as social inclusion support, is facing increasingly logistical and human resource constraints, notably due to the confinement and urgent need to instate social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. Many of the volunteers, who are the backbone of the Fund, can no longer be mobilised, as they often belong to groups at a higher risk of severe illness caused by COVID-19. The Fund's main objective is to support the development of the country's capacity to provide food and basic material assistance. Specific measures must be taken as a matter of urgency in order to protect the most vulnerable from this disease and to ensure that they continue to receive assistance from the FEAD, in particular with regard to the provision of the necessary protective equipment against the disease. This initiative complements the first ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’, a package of measures proposed by the Commission on 13 March 2020 which introduced a number of important changes to provide a more effective response to the current situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to address the difficulties encountered by public authorities and partner organisations in implementing the FEAD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific measures The proposed measures provide for the following:  eligibility of expenditure incurred from 1 February 2020 for FEAD operations that strengthen the capacity to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the possibility to give Member States the exceptional possibility to apply for a co-financing rate of 100% for the accounting year 2020-2021; flexibility for Member States (i) to adjust the schemes of support to the current context, including by allowing alternative schemes of delivery through electronic vouchers (lower risk of contamination) and by allowing Member States (ii) to amend certain elements of the operational programme without requiring an adoption by Commission decision; possibility to provide the necessary protective materials and equipment to partner organisations outside the technical assistance budget; flexibility measures which reduce the administrative burden on the authorities in terms of compliance with certain legislative requirements, in particular as regards monitoring and control and audit; specific provisions regarding the eligibility of costs incurred by beneficiaries in case the delivery of food/basic material assistance or social assistance is delayed as well as for suspended and not fully implemented operations. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments set out in the FEAD Regulation. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived remains unchanged. The proposal will facilitate an acceleration of programme implementation and result in a frontloading of payment appropriations.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis can consequently have dramatic socio-economic consequences in certain communities where fishing and aquaculture play a key role. Small-scale coastal fisheries represent close to 75% of all active vessels and over 55% of direct employment; they constitute the main economic activity in many coastal areas. On 13 March 2020, the Commission proposed a ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’ directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investments Funds, to fight the crisis immediately. However, the fact that fishing and aquaculture activities have been interrupted or significantly reduced makes it difficult to implement the current operational measures and programmes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in a normal way. In the absence of effective measures to tackle the crisis, the EMFF is unlikely to be fully implemented by the end of the current programming period. The Commission considers that it should be possible for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 to support specific measures until 31 December 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (EMFF Regulation) and Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 (CMO Regulation) in order to introduce specific measures under the EMFF to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Specific measures The amendments to the EMFF are intended to allow a more flexible redistribution of financial resources within operational programmes in each Member State and a simplified procedure for amending operational programmes as regards the introduction of new measures. The proposed specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector comprise: - support to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or the reduction of production caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to producer organisations and associations of producer organisations for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products, in accordance with the Common Market Organisation (CMO). It is proposed that these measures are retroactively eligible as of 1 February 2020 and available until 31 December 2020. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the EMFF remains unchanged. The available payment appropriations in the 2020 budget for the EMFF can accommodate a shift between Union Priorities within operational programmes. The new measures will in fact to a large extent replace initially planned initiatives, which are now being stopped due to the general decline of economic activity.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis can consequently have dramatic socio-economic consequences in certain communities where fishing and aquaculture play a key role. Small-scale coastal fisheries represent close to 75% of all active vessels and over 55% of direct employment; they constitute the main economic activity in many coastal areas. On 13 March 2020, the Commission proposed a ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’ directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investments Funds, to fight the crisis immediately. However, the fact that fishing and aquaculture activities have been interrupted or significantly reduced makes it difficult to implement the current operational measures and programmes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in a normal way. In the absence of effective measures to tackle the crisis, the EMFF is unlikely to be fully implemented by the end of the current programming period. The Commission considers that it should be possible for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 to support specific measures until 31 December 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (EMFF Regulation) and Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 (CMO Regulation) in order to introduce specific measures under the EMFF to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Specific measures The amendments to the EMFF are intended to allow a more flexible redistribution of financial resources within operational programmes in each Member State and a simplified procedure for amending operational programmes as regards the introduction of new measures. The proposed specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector comprise: - support to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or the reduction of production caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to producer organisations and associations of producer organisations for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products, in accordance with the Common Market Organisation (CMO). It is proposed that these measures are retroactively eligible as of 1 February 2020 and available until 31 December 2020. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the EMFF remains unchanged. The available payment appropriations in the 2020 budget for the EMFF can accommodate a shift between Union Priorities within operational programmes. The new measures will in fact to a large extent replace initially planned initiatives, which are now being stopped due to the general decline of economic activity. By consequence, the proposed measures aim to ensure an effective implementation of the 2020 budget and the 2014-2020 allocation for the EMFF."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medical devices. At the same time, it sets high standards of quality and safety for medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such devices. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 significantly reinforces key elements of the existing regulatory approach in Council Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive 93/42/EEC, such as the supervision of notified bodies, conformity assessment procedures, clinical investigations and clinical evaluation, vigilance and market surveillance, whilst introducing provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding medical devices, to improve health and safety. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting public health crisis represent an unprecedented challenge for Member States and a heavy burden for national authorities, health care institutions and economic operators. The coronavirus crisis has created exceptional circumstances that require considerable additional resources and increased availability of vitally important medical devices such as medical gloves, surgical masks or intensive care equipment. None of these measures could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation. These extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore very likely that Member States, health care institutions, economic operators and other stakeholders would not have been able to ensure its proper implementation and application from the date of application initially foreseen on 26 May 2020. CONTENT: for exceptional reasons, in the current context of the coronavirus epidemic, the Commission proposes to defer by one year, to 26 May 2021, the date of application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 which should have applied from 26 May 2020. The proposed amendment aims to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, namely the establishment of a rigorous, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for medical devices that ensures a high level of protection of public health and patient safety and the proper functioning of the internal market for these devices. At the same time, it is proposed to defer the date of repeal of Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices and Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices by one year. These postponements would ensure that an operational regulatory framework for medical devices would be in place from 26 May 2020. In addition, the proposed amendment aims to ensure that, in exceptional cases, the Commission may adopt, as soon as possible, EU-wide derogations following national derogations, in order to effectively address potential shortages of vitally important medical devices in the EU. In view of the urgent need to respond immediately to the public health crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed amending Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is having a very negative impact on the economic and financial stability of the regions affected by enlargement and the neighbourhood policy. Most, if not all, enlargement and neighbourhood partners are set for a recession this year. Depending on the spread of the virus, as well as of its economic consequences, there is also a clear and imminent risk related to social stability and security, with possible spill-overs within the region and beyond. In these circumstances, the European Commission proposes to use Macro Financial Assistance (MFA) to support ten Neighbourhood countries in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. MFA is one of the instruments available to the EU to respond to external crises. It is used to address balance of payments crisis situations, in tandem with a disbursing International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangement that is subject to an agreed programme of economic reforms. The proposal is part of the ‘Team Europe’ strategy, which is the targeted response by which the EU intends to support its partners in their fight against the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to make available to partners a total of up to EUR 3 billion in medium and long-term loans to help cover their external financing needs in 2020 and 2021. Breakdown of the AMF Based on a preliminary assessment of financing needs, the amounts of MFA to be made available shall be distributed to the beneficiaries as follows:  Republic of Albania (EUR 180 million); Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUR 250 million); Georgia (EUR 150 million); Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (EUR 200 million); Kosovo (EUR 100 million); Republic of Moldova (EUR 100 million); Montenegro (EUR 60 million); Republic of Northern Macedonia (EUR 160 million); Republic of Tunisia (EUR 600 million); Ukraine (EUR 1.2 billion). The proposed MFA amounts would be made available to the beneficiary countries for 12 months in the form of loans granted on very favourable terms to help them meet their immediate and urgent financing needs. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2020. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021 provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. Objectives and conditions Combined with IMF support, this financing shall:  contribute to covering the external financing needs of the partner in the context of a significant deterioration of their external accounts brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis; alleviate the partner’s budgetary financing needs; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the foreseen IMF programme; support structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The granting of the EU MFA shall be subject to:  the pre-condition that the partner respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights; satisfactory progress with the IMF programme and the continued drawing by the partner on IMF funds. The Commission shall report yearly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year. Furthermore, the fulfilment of the objectives of the assistance shall be assessed not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period of the assistance. Budgetary implications The planned assistance shall be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission shall conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance shall correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the Guarantee Fund for External Actions of the EU. The Commission considers that the budgetary impact of the proposed MFA operations can be accommodated within the Commission’s proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if the European Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the unprecedented measures put in place by Member States to contain the spread of COVID-19, in particular measures concerning confinement and social distancing of persons, may prevent companies and cooperative societies from complying with their legal obligations under national and Union company law, in particular, by making it considerably difficult for them to hold general meetings. At EU level, European Companies (SEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and European Cooperative Societies (SCEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003. Both Regulations require a general meeting to be held within six months of the end of the financial year. In view of the current exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary derogation from this requirement should be granted. Many Member States have already allowed the use of digital tools and processes for holding general meetings and have extended the deadlines for holding general meetings in 2020. CONTENT: the holding of the general meeting is essential to ensure that legally binding or economically necessary decisions are taken in a timely manner. Under the draft Council Regulation, SEs and SCEs should be allowed to hold their general meeting within 12 months of the end of the financial year, provided that it takes place no later than 31 December 2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the Council may adopt the act only if the European Parliament has approved it. BACKGROUND: the unprecedented measures put in place by Member States to contain the spread of COVID-19, in particular measures concerning confinement and social distancing of persons, may prevent companies and cooperative societies from complying with their legal obligations under national and Union company law, in particular, by making it considerably difficult for them to hold general meetings. At EU level, European Companies (SEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 and European Cooperative Societies (SCEs) are regulated by Council Regulation (EC) No 1435/2003. Both Regulations require a general meeting to be held within six months of the end of the financial year. In view of the current exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a temporary derogation from this requirement should be granted. Many Member States have already allowed the use of digital tools and processes for holding general meetings and have extended the deadlines for holding general meetings in 2020. CONTENT: the holding of the general meeting is essential to ensure that legally binding or economically necessary decisions are taken in a timely manner. Under the draft Council Regulation, SEs and SCEs should be allowed to hold their general meeting within 12 months of the end of the financial year, provided that it takes place no later than 31 December 2020. As this derogation is a temporary measure due to the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, it should only apply to general meetings that are required to be held in 2020. The proposed Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp fall in air traffic due to a significant drop in demand and the adoption by Member States and third countries of direct measures, such as border closures and flight bans, to curb its spread. Figures published by the EU Network Manager at the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (‘Eurocontrol’), indicate a fall in air traffic of around 90% for the European region at the end of March 2020 as compared to March 2019. The aviation sector is of strategic importance to the European Union and makes a vital contribution to the EU’s overall economy and employment. In 2016, for example, the aviation sector supported 9.4 million jobs in the EU and contributed more than EUR 624 billion to the EU's GDP. It also contributes to the success of SMEs and tourism. The liquidity crisis in the aviation sector may lead to insolvencies within a few months if left unaddressed. Given the contribution of aviation to the overall performance of the EU economy and the importance of its overall weight, the Commission considers it essential that the EU takes action to support the EU aviation sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to temporarily amend several provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow the Commission and national authorities to more easily address a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate of the impacts on the aviation sector for the duration of the crisis. These temporary measures include the following: Modification to air carrier licencing rules in case of financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, Member States must suspend or revoke the operating licence of any air carrier, which may not to be able to fulfil its actual or potential financial obligations for the next twelve months. Alternatively, the authorities may grant a temporary licence to such airlines. However, experience has shown that it also sends a very negative signal to the market about the ability of an airline to survive, which in turn aggravates its financial problems, in particular in terms of cash flow. Accordingly, the proposal proposes that based on assessments, carried out from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, the competent licensing authority may decide before the end of that period not to suspend or revoke the operating license of the Union carrier provided that safety is not at risk, and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within the following 12 months. Simplification of procedures for the imposition of restrictions on traffic rights The proposal provides for a temporary derogation to procedural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. The derogation clarifies that a Member State may temporarily keep a justified and proportionate emergency measure in place for a period beyond 14 days – but limited to the duration of public health risks clearly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should be able to refuse, limit or impose conditions on the exercise of traffic rights to deal with problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which could be of extended duration. Such emergency measures taken in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should respect the principles of proportionality and transparency and should be based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. At the request of any of the Member State(s) involved or on its own initiative, the Commission may suspend this action if it does not meet the requirements of the Regulation or is otherwise contrary to Union law. To this effect, Member States are obliged to inform the Commission about changes in duration and scope of their emergency measures. Improving the efficiency of ground handling contracting during the COVID-19 crisis The proposal allows the managing bodies of airport to prolong contracts of suppliers of ground handling service until 31 December 2021, in derogation of Directive 96/67/EC. It also allows the managing body of an airport to directly choose a ground handling service for a maximum period of six months. The amendments also provide for the possibility for the Commission to extend the periods concerned by means of delegated acts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator). Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lay down common rules for access to the international road haulage market and the international market for coach and bus services, respectively). Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union). Directive 2007/59/EC of the European Parliament (lays down rules on the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union). Directive 2012/34/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (establishes a single European railway area). Directive 96/50/EC (lays down conditions for obtaining boatmasters’ certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterways in the Union). Directive (EU) 2016/1629 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down technical requirements for inland waterway vessels). Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down rules on ship and port facility security). Directive 2005/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down measures to enhance port security in the face of threats of security incidents).

As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly.

BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020.

Only eight Member States have transposed both Directives in 2019 (BG, FI, FR, GR, IT, NL, RO, SI). In the light of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the remaining 17 Member States have requested a delay to transposition, claiming they will be unable to complete the necessary legislation before 16 June 2020.

BACKGROUND: the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and India was signed in New Delhi on 23 November 2001 and entered into force on 14 October 2002. The Agreement has been renewed for additional periods of five years, in 2009 and 2015 respectively. The current Agreement is due to expire on 17 May 2020. The Commission believes that the Agreement provides an important framework for conducting and facilitating cooperation between the EU and India in common priority science and technology areas of mutual benefit. In the past years, under the Horizon 2020 Programme, - a joint call on water resulted in 7 selected projects for a total of EUR 30 million with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT); - a joint call on new generation vaccines with DBT for a total of EUR 30 million resulted in 3 selected projects; - two innovation initiatives were launched: an incubators network and an innovation platform, resulting on more than 20 innovation partnerships among its participants; - an Implementing Arrangement between the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and the European Commission was signed to facilitate mobility of Indian researchers to European Research Council grantees teams; - two cofunding mechanisms were set up by DBT and the Ministry of Earth Science (MoES) to fund successful Indian participants in more than 50 Horizon 2020 calls. At the meeting of the India-EU Joint Steering Committee established by the Agreement, held in New Delhi on 1 March 2019, both Parties noted their intention to renew the Agreement for a further period of five years without any amendment. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal of the Agreement for scientific and technological cooperation between the European Community and the Government of the Republic of India for an additional period of five years (i.e. from 17.5.2020 to 16.5.2025). The Agreement allows for a frame to identify areas of cooperation on research and innovation of mutual interest and in line with the EU's agenda and strategy on international cooperation.

The Agreement was renewed for additional periods of five years, with retroactive effect to 8 November 2009 and 8 November 2014 respectively. The Agreement expired on November 7, 2019. Ukraine has a long tradition of excellence in science and technology and despite the difficulties encountered in recent years, the country still has first-class scientists and remains an important player in science, technology and innovation (STI) in the European Union's neighbourhood. Cooperation between the EU and Ukraine is traditionally very active notably in the fields of advanced/new materials, IT-technology, physics and astronomy, engineering, agricultural technology, nanotechnology, biotechnology and their applications across various sectors such as aviation, energy, and biomedicine, in particular immunotherapies for cancer.

The renewed Agreement shall not create any new or additional rights or obligations for either Party, but shall extend over time the existing legal regime between the Parties in the field of scientific and technological cooperation. This Decision shall enable both Parties to strengthen cooperation and develop a more strategic partnership by increasing the scale and scope of existing cooperation, addressing global challenges and promoting reciprocal access to programmes and funding. The renewal of the Agreement shall allow both the Union and Ukraine to mutually benefit from the scientific and technological progress achieved through their ongoing cooperation activities.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit in May 2009, the EU reaffirmed its political support towards full liberalisation of the visa regime in a secure environment, and towards promoting mobility by concluding visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Eastern Partnership countries. According to the common approach for the development of EU policy on visa facilitation agreed at the level of COREPER by the Member States in December 2005, a visa facilitation agreement would not be concluded without a readmission agreement being in place. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Belarus to facilitate the readmission of persons residing without authorisation. The purpose of the Agreement is to establish rapid and effective procedures for the identification and safe and orderly return of persons who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, presence in, or residence on the territory of Belarus or one of the Member States of the European Union, and to facilitate the transit of such persons in a spirit of co-operation. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - an opening clause reaffirming that the agreement must be applied in such a way as to ensure respect for human rights and the obligations and responsibilities of the requested and requesting States under the international instruments applicable to them; - readmission obligations on the basis of full reciprocity, applying to nationals as well as third-country nationals and stateless persons; - obligation to readmit nationals also concerning (i) former nationals who have been deprived of their nationality or who have renounced it without obtaining the nationality of another State; (ii) family members (i.e. spouse and unmarried minor children), whatever their nationality, who do not have an independent right of residence in the requesting State; - obligation to readmit third-country nationals and stateless persons subject to certain preconditions. This obligation does not apply to persons who have only carried out airport transit or who have obtained a visa or residence permit from the requested Member State unless, for example, the person does not comply with one of the conditions attached to the visa; - definition of the technical modalities governing the readmission procedure (readmission application, means of evidence, time limits, transfer modalities and modes of transport). Procedural flexibility is provided by the fact that no readmission application will be needed in cases where the person to be readmitted is in possession of a valid travel document; - description of the agreed accelerated procedure for persons apprehended in an area extending up to 30 kilometres beyond the common land border between a Member State and Belarus, as well as on the territory of the international airports of the Member States and Belarus. - necessary rules on costs, data protection and the position of the agreement in relation to other international obligations. In particular, the proposal for a Decision specifies that the Commission, assisted by experts from the Member States, shall represent the Union in the Joint Readmission Committee established by the Agreement. The specific situation of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is reflected in the preamble, and, regarding Denmark, in a relevant joint declaration."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit Declaration of 7 May 2009, the Union and the partner countries expressed their political support towards liberalisation of the visa regime in a safe and secure environment and reaffirmed their intention to take gradual steps towards a visa free regime for their citizens in due course. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Belarus on the facilitation of the issuance of visas. The purpose of the Agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas to citizens of the Union and Belarus for intended stays of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - for all visa applicants, a decision on whether or not to issue a visa must, in principle, be taken within 10 calendar days. This period may be extended to a maximum of 30 calendar days when further examination is required. In urgent cases, it may be reduced to two working days or less; - the amount of fees charged for processing visa applications from citizens of the European Union and Belarus shall be EUR 35. These fees shall apply to all visa applicants. In addition, the following categories of persons shall be exempt from these visa fees: children under 12 years of age, persons with disabilities, close relatives, members of official delegations; - the documents required to justify the purpose of the trip have been simplified for certain categories of applicants (e.g. close relatives, business people, members of official delegations, primary and secondary school pupils, students, persons participating in scientific, cultural and sporting events, journalists, etc.); - simplified conditions are provided for the issue of multiple-entry visas valid from 1 to 5 years to certain categories of persons (e.g. members of governments, parliaments and courts, permanent members of official delegations, spouses and children visiting European Union citizens legally residing in the territory of Belarus, or citizens of the Republic of Belarus legally residing in a Member State, persons participating in official, scientific or cultural exchange programmes or cross-border programmes, international sports events); - citizens of the European Union and citizens of Belarus holding a valid biometric diplomatic passport and holders of a valid EU laissez-passer are exempt from the visa requirement for short stays. However, the final assessment of Belarus’ system of issuance will have to be made by the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, before the conclusion of the Agreement. The importance of the fundamental principles governing the cooperation between the Parties as well as the obligations and responsibilities, including the respect of human rights and democratic principles, stemming from the relevant international instruments to which they are bound, is underlined in a preamble to the Agreement. The Parties may suspend the Agreement in whole or in part for any reason, including grounds for suspension such as breach or abuse of a provision of the Agreement, human rights and democracy considerations."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT Convention) aims, by establishing the ICCAT, to promote cooperation in maintaining the populations of tuna and tuna-like fish in the Atlantic Ocean at levels that permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes. The Convention entered into force on 21 March 1969. The Union is a party to the Convention, having approved it pursuant to the Council Decision of 9 June 1986. From 2013 to 2018, discussions took place within the ICCAT Commission on the changes that are needed to the Convention. As a result, a Protocol has been drafted to amend to the Convention. The Protocol amending ICCAT, once signed (and provisionally applied from the date of its entry into force for other Contracting Parties, pending its entry into force for the Union), must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Protocol to amend the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The Protocol is consistent with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides that the Union shall: - ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and are managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies; - apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and is to aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains population of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield; - adopt management and conservation measures based on best available scientific advice, to support the development of scientific knowledge and advice, to gradually eliminate discards and to promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the avoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fishing with low impact on the marine ecosystem and fishery resources; - apply those objectives and principles in the conduct of its external fisheries relations. In accordance with the Joint Communication by the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission ‘International ocean governance: an agenda for the future of oceans’6 and the Council conclusions on that Joint Communication, promoting measures to support and enhance the effectiveness of RFMOs and, where relevant, improve their governance is a central feature of the Union’s action in these fora. The Protocol meets these objectives."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the two-way carriage of passengers and goods by road between Switzerland and the EU is regulated by the Land Transport Agreement between the EU and Switzerland ('EU Agreement'). Under the EU Agreement, the transport of passengers by coach and bus between two points situated on the territory of the same Contracting Party by carriers established in the territory of the other Contracting Party, known as cabotage, is not authorised. This means that the carriers operating the passenger services which cross the border can only carry passengers across the border or within the territory of the Contracting Party they are established in. Bus and coach operators established in Switzerland may not carry passengers between two points on the German side of the border and operators established in the EU may not carry passengers between two points on the Swiss side of the border. However, Article 20(2) of the EU Agreement specifically allows pre-existing rights under bilateral agreements concluded between individual EU Member States and Switzerland that were in force at the time of conclusion of the EU Agreement to continue to be exercised. The border regions of Germany and Switzerland are closely integrated. Many Germans commute to work in Switzerland and vice versa and there is vibrant cross-border passenger traffic by road. A number of bus and coach services are offered which cross the border and thus connect the border regions of the two countries. By letter dated 11 May 2017, Germany informed the Commission that it would appreciate if the Union was to empower it to amend its bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland of 1953 with a view to authorising cabotage operations during the provision of passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border region between the two countries. Switzerland informed the Commission that it was also interested in amending this agreement to that effect. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to empower Germany to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the respective border regions of Germany and Switzerland in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between the two countries, provided that there is no discrimination between carriers established in the Union and no distortion of competition. Cabotage operations allow increasing the load factor of the vehicles which increases the economic efficiency of the services. The authorisation of cabotage operations in the context of the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between Germany and Switzerland would allow the carriers involved to become more competitive and efficient. In order to ensure that the cabotage operations concerned do not excessively alter the functioning of the internal market for coach and bus services, as established by Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, their authorisation should be subject to the conditions that there is no discrimination between carriers established within the Union and no distortion of competition. For the same reason, cabotage operations should only be authorised in the border regions of Germany in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between Germany and Switzerland. As border regions of Germany shall be considered the administrative districts of Freiburg and Tübingen in Baden-Württemberg and the administrative district of Swabia in Bavaria. This proposal is based on a request by Germany and concerns only this Member State. A similar request has been received by Italy which is subject to a parallel procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s legislative proposals on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 aimed to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change or generational renewal, while continuing to support farmers in the Union for a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Those proposals are closely linked to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) of the Union for the years 2021 to 2027. The legislative procedure was not concluded in time to allow Member States and the Commission to prepare all elements necessary to apply the new legal framework and the CAP Strategic Plans as of 1 January 2021, as initially proposed by the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure that support can be granted to farmers and other beneficiaries from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in 2021, the Union should continue to grant such support for one more year under the conditions of the existing legal framework, which covers the period 2014 to 2020. CONTENT: this proposal aims at providing certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and ensuring the continuity of support for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new CAP becomes applicable. In order to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations at national level, these changes would need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by mid-2020 Extension of the applicability of the existing regulations The existing legal framework is laid down in particular in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013, (EU) No 1307/2013, (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition, to facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework which covers the period starting on 1 January 2022, rules shall be laid down to regulate how certain support granted on a multiannual basis will be integrated into the new legal framework. In light of the fact that the Union should continue to support rural development in 2021, Member States, that demonstrate the risk to run out of funds and not to be able to undertake new legal commitments in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, shall have the possibility to extend their rural development programmes or certain of their regional rural development programmes supported by the EAFRD to 31 December 2021 and to finance those extended programmes from the corresponding budget allocation for the year 2021. Transition to the next CAP period The new CAP comes with significant changes. Transitional rules are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period, in particular concerning the continuation of multiannual commitments undertaken in the current and previous programming periods. The Single CMO Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, including aid schemes for specific sectors. It sets out the parameters for intervening on agricultural markets and providing sector-specific support. To ensure coherence, most interventions of the new CAP will be part of one strategic CAP support plan per Member State, including several sectorial interventions that have previously been set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Under the current rules, the different sectoral programmes follow different time frames. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between the aid schemes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions under the new CAP it is necessary to set rules regarding the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector and in the olive oil and table olives sector, it is necessary to regulate the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes. Budgetary implications The current Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 on rural development and (EU) No 1307/2013 on direct payments do not lay down allocations for the transitional period (beyond calendar year 2020). Therefore, the initiative has a budgetary impact in the sense that it adds the allocations for direct payments and rural development for the relevant transitional period to ensure smooth continuity. These allocations are equal to those in the CAP Plan proposal and they are coherent with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027. Where Member States do not decide to prolong their current rural development programmes, the 2021 EAFRD allocations will be transferred to the 2022 – 2025 EAFRD allocations. Similarly, for the transitional period, the allocations contained in Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 need to be adjusted to respect the overall amounts for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) included in the MFF proposal. The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. It is to be financed through financial discipline applied on direct payments. As such, it does not entail any additional expenditure. The present proposal is neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments. The impact as regards the estimated schedule for payment appropriations will depend on Member States decisions as regards the prolongation of the current rural development programmes. Similarly, any decision of Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development will be neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments but may have an impact in terms of timing of payments that however cannot be estimated."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe and the European Community entered into force on 29 August 20112 and has since been renewed automatically. The previous Protocol to the Agreement, which entered into force on 23 May 2014, expired on 22 May 2018. The evaluation report concluded that the Union’s tuna fishing sector has a strong interest in fishing in São Tomé and Príncipe and that a renewal of the Protocol would help strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance and contribute to improved governance of the fisheries in the region. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe with a view to concluding a new Protocol to the Agreement. Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 17 April 2019. The Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of its provisional application, i.e. from the date on which it is signed. The negotiation of a new protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with São Tomé and Príncipe forms part of the Union’s external action in relation to countries in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and takes into account, in particular, Union objectives on respecting democratic principles and human rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol on the implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the European Community. Objectives of the proposal The objective of the Protocol is to enable the Union and São Tomé and Príncipe to work more closely on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in São Tomé and Príncipe waters and to support efforts by São Tomé and Príncipe to develop its fisheries sector. Fishing opportunities In accordance with the priorities of the Fisheries Policy reform, the new Protocol provides fishing opportunities for Union vessels in São Tomé and Príncipe waters, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and following the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: (a) 28 freezer tuna seiners; (b) 6 surface longliners. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 840 000, based on: - a reference tonnage of 8 000 tonnes per year, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR 400 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol; - support for the development of São Tomé and Príncipe’s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 440 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of São Tomé and Príncipe’s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The Commission is authorised to approve, on behalf of the Union, amendments to the Protocol to be adopted by the Joint Committee established under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement."

In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on International Trade, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement. Some years ago when Switzerland was faced with a sharp increase in meat imports, including ‘seasoned meat’, the Swiss Parliament adopted a motion at the end of 2015 to reclassify certain ‘seasoned meat’, which led to a sharp increase in customs duties for the products in question. In 2017, the EU challenged this measure at the WTO, alleging its incompatibility with WTO rules. In April 2018, Switzerland agreed that it had to compensate for the increase of tariff and launched a negotiation procedure under Article XXVIII of the GATT in order to modify the tariff concessions in its schedule for the ‘meat not further prepared than seasoned’. At the end of 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate compensation. Switzerland proposed to increase its WTO tariff rate quota for beef by 1 200 tonnes as compensation. Within this tariff quota, Switzerland committed itself in particular to allocate a specific sub-quota of 600 tonnes for ‘seasoned meat’. A new tariff line has been created for this purpose. Switzerland also maintains the previously agreed reduced duty for beef imported for the purposes of processing into dry meat. A draft agreement was initialled in July 2019. On 24 October, the Council adopted a decision on the signing of the agreement, which was signed on 9 December 2019 in Brussels. By exchange of letters, the EU and Switzerland agreed on the amendments to be incorporated in the Swiss schedule of commitments: new tariffs (including for dry beef meat) and the increased tariff quota from 22 500 tonnes (current) to 23 700 tonnes."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the EU, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: air services between the European Union and Jordan presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Jordan. The conclusion of a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Jordan has been a priority for the EU and is an important element in the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The negotiating mandate received from the Council in June 2007 set the objective of establishing a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU and Jordan. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Jordan in which European and Jordanian air carriers would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Jordan was initialled by the two sides on 17 March 2010. LEGAL BASE: Article 207 (5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2), (5), (6) and (7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Jordan would generate 54,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 30 million in the first effective year of market opening. CONTENT: the Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU and its Member States, and Jordan has been negotiated under a mandate. By establishing a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Area, the Agreement will extend EU legislation in the field of aviation to Jordan. In particular, Jordan will take over EU legislation in important fields such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement will replace the existing arrangements made by individual Member States. It creates simultaneously for all Union air carriers uniform conditions for market access, and establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation between the EU and Jordan in fields essential for the safe, secure, and efficient operation of air services. These arrangements can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. The Agreement allows for the simultaneous extension of its terms to the 27 Member States, applying the same rules without discrimination and benefiting all Union air carriers regardless of their nationality. These carriers can now operate freely from any point in the EU to any point in Jordan which is currently not the case. Removal of all market access restrictions between the EU and Jordan will not only attract new entrants to the market and create opportunities to operate to underserved airports, but will also facilitate consolidation between EU air carriers. The Agreement secures for all EU air carriers access to commercial opportunities, such as the possibility of freely establishing prices. One further objective of the mandate is to create a level playing field between all EU and Jordanian air carriers, and this requires strong regulatory co-operation which can only be delivered at Union level. The Agreement aims at: gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; alignment of the Jordanian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management; the possibility of extending the Agreement in order to create with all the other Mediterranean Partners a Common Euro Mediterranean Aviation Area. The Agreement consists of the main body including the main principles, and three annexes: Annex 1 on traffic rights, Annex 2 on transitional provisions and Annex 3 including the EU aviation legislation to be taken over by Jordan.

BACKGROUND : the Common Aviation Area Agreement between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in June 2009. Air services between the EU and Georgia presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Georgia. It is part of the EU neighbourhood policy to replace this network of bilateral agreements through the establishment of a Common Aviation Area between the EU and its neighbours. The negotiating mandate set the objective of establishing a Common Aviation Area (CAA) between the EU and Georgia. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Georgia in which European and Georgian airlines would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Georgia was initialled by the two sides on 5 March 2010. IMPACT ASSESSMENT : the Agreement ensures the gradual establishment of an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area. A report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an EU/Georgia Common Aviation Area would generate 25,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 17 million in the first effective year of market opening. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee which will be responsible for reviewing the implementation of the Agreement and its effects. LEGAL BASE : CONTENT : The Agreement aims at: - gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; - non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; - Alignment of the Georgian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement provides for the possibility for Georgia to join the main multilateral aviation agreement with European countries, the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA) signed in 2006. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS : the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Capital Requirements Regulation or CRR) establishes together with Directive 2013/36/EU (the Capital Requirements Directive or CRD) the prudential regulatory framework for credit institutions operating in the Union. Adopted in the aftermath of the financial crisis in 2007-2008 and largely based on international standards endorsed in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), known as the ""Basel III framework"", this prudential framework has contributed to enhancing the resilience of institutions operating in the Union and to making them better prepared to face potential difficulties, including difficulties stemming from possible future crises. The severe economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the exceptional containment measures are having a far-reaching impact on the economy. Credit institutions will have a major role to play in the recovery but are likely to suffer from the deterioration of the economic situation. The competent authorities have granted banks temporary relief from capital, liquidity and operational requirements so that they can continue to play their role in financing the real economy despite a more difficult environment. As a result of the exceptional situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, some of these rules can now be applied more flexibly, allowing banks to focus on lending to households and businesses. At the same time, it is essential that institutions continue to measure risks in an accurate, consistent and transparent manner to be able to monitor the effects of the pandemic on their balance sheets and avoid jeopardising the resilience of the European banking sector. This proposal is part of a package of measures taken by the European Commission to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak across the European Union. CONTENT: the Commission proposes, as a short-term solution, to introduce targeted changes to EU banking prudential rules (the Capital Requirements Regulation) to maximise the capacity of credit institutions to lend and to absorb losses related to the Coronavirus pandemic, while still ensuring their continued resilience. Transitional arrangements for mitigating the impact of IFRS 9 provisions on regulatory capital The Commission proposes to amend the transitional arrangements to mitigate the potentially significant negative impact on institutions’ Common Equity Tier 1 capital arising from expected credit loss accounting under IFRS 9. The application of IFRS 9 during the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to a sudden significant increase in expected credit loss provisions, as for many exposures expected losses over their lifetime may need to be calculated. In order to mitigate these potential negative effects, the Commission proposes to extend the current transitional provisions of the CRR by two years. Thus, the reference date for any increase in provisions that would fall under the extended transitional provisions would be moved from 1 January 2018 to 1 January 2020. The extension of the transitional period would allow institutions to fully add-back to their CET1 capital any increase in new provisions recognised in 2020 and 2021 for their financial assets that are not credit-impaired. The amount that could be added back from 2022 to 2024 would decrease in a linear manner. Treatment of publicly guaranteed loans under the non-performing loans prudential backstop Non-performing loans guaranteed official export credit agencies receive a preferential treatment regarding provisioning requirements under the CRR. It is proposed to temporarily extend this preferential treatment to exposures guaranteed or counter guaranteed by the public sector in the context of measures aimed at mitigating the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to Union State aid rules, where applicable. This would take account of the similar risk profile of these guaranteed exposures. Leverage ratio buffer application date The latest revision of the CRR imposed a leverage ratio buffer requirement on global systemically important institutions (G-SIIs). The date of application of this new requirement, initially set at 1 January 2022, shall be extended by one year to 1 January 2023. This would free up credit institutions’ operational capacity and allow them to focus on the more immediate challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Offsetting the impact of excluding certain exposures from the calculation of the leverage ratio In accordance with the Basel framework, the CRR grants discretionary power, in exceptional circumstances, to temporarily exclude certain central bank exposures from an institutions’ total exposure measure. The exemption may be granted for a limited period of time not exceeding one year. In order to facilitate the effective transmission of monetary policy actions, this discretion shall be implemented together with the leverage ratio requirement on 28 June 2021. However, the current crisis of the COVID-19 showed that the compensation mechanism was too restrictive. In order to provide greater flexibility to act in possible future crises, the proposal amends the compensation mechanism. In particular, a credit institution that exercises the discretion shall be required to calculate the adjusted leverage ratio only once, namely at the moment it exercises the discretion. The adjusted leverage ratio will apply throughout the full period during which the discretion is exercised and will not change like under the current offsetting mechanism. Other application dates The Commission also proposes that the application dates of some of the capital benefits envisaged in the CRR but not yet applicable need to be anticipated, namely: (i) the provisions on the treatment of certain software assets, (ii) the provisions on certain loans backed by pensions or salaries, (iii) the revised supporting factor for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and (iv) the new supporting factor for infrastructure finance. The objective is to allow credit institutions to free up capital and give their lending activity a much-needed boost during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation requires that applications for marketing authorisation for a medicinal product, in a Member State or in the Union, be accompanied by a dossier containing the results of clinical trials carried out on the product. Sponsors are required, before the commencement of any clinical trial, to request authorisation from the competent authority of the Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Clinical trials necessitate the performance of multiple operations which may fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC (Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms) or Directive 2009/41/EC (Directive on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms) in cases where the investigational medicinal product contains or consists of GMOs. Experience shows that, in clinical trials with investigational medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs, the procedure to achieve compliance with the requirements of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC as regards the environmental impact assessment and authorisation by the competent authority of a Member State is complex and may take a significant amount of time. The complexity of that procedure increases greatly in the case of multi-centre clinical trials conducted in several Member States, as sponsors of clinical trials need to submit multiple requests for authorisation to multiple competent authorities in different Member States in parallel. The Commission considers that it is of paramount importance that clinical trials with investigational medicinal products against COVID-19 containing or consisting of GMOs can be conducted within the Union, that they can begin as soon as possible, and that they are not delayed due to the complexity of differing national procedures put in place by Member States in implementation of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC. CONTENT: in the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed Regulation aims to ensure that clinical trials with medicinal products for human use containing or consisting of GMOs to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start swiftly and without a prior environmental risk assessment and/or prior consent under Directive 2001/18/EC or Directive 2009/41/EC. The Regulation shall apply for as long as COVID-19 is considered a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or declared an emergency situation in accordance with Decision No 1082/2013/EU and remains so."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down common rules and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds. The general budget of the Union for the financial year 2020 amended the total amount of resources for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing the commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI in 2020 by EUR 28 333 334 in current prices and by increasing the total amount of commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI for the entire programming period to EUR 4 556 215 406 in current prices. For 2020, the additional resources of EUR 23.7 million in 2011 prices shall be financed by the global margin for commitments within the margin of the multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020. The Commission considers that there is an urgent need to amend the YEI support programmes in order to include the additional resources allocated to the specific allocation for the YEI before the end of 2020. It has explored the scope for manoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary to propose amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. CONTENT: in line with the adopted budget for 2020, the Commission proposes to increase the commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI by EUR 28 333 334 in current prices, bringing the total amount for 2020 to EUR 145 million in current prices. The proposal further specifies that the relevant provisions that have been introduced to facilitate the programming of the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2019 shall also apply to the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2020. The proposed amendment is estimated to result in additional payments of EUR 3 million in 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation requires that applications for marketing authorisation for a medicinal product, in a Member State or in the Union, be accompanied by a dossier containing the results of clinical trials carried out on the product. Sponsors are required, before the commencement of any clinical trial, to request authorisation from the competent authority of the Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Clinical trials necessitate the performance of multiple operations which may fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC (Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms) or Directive 2009/41/EC (Directive on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms) in cases where the investigational medicinal product contains or consists of GMOs. Experience shows that, in clinical trials with investigational medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs, the procedure to achieve compliance with the requirements of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC as regards the environmental impact assessment and authorisation by the competent authority of a Member State is complex and may take a significant amount of time. The complexity of that procedure increases greatly in the case of multi-centre clinical trials conducted in several Member States, as sponsors of clinical trials need to submit multiple requests for authorisation to multiple competent authorities in different Member States in parallel. The Commission considers that it is of paramount importance that clinical trials with investigational medicinal products against COVID-19 containing or consisting of GMOs can be conducted within the Union, that they can begin as soon as possible, and that they are not delayed due to the complexity of differing national procedures put in place by Member States in implementation of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC. CONTENT: in the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed Regulation aims to ensure that clinical trials with medicinal products for human use containing or consisting of GMOs to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start swiftly and without a prior environmental risk assessment and/or prior consent under Directive 2001/18/EC or Directive 2009/41/EC. The Regulation shall apply for as long as COVID-19 is considered a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or declared an emergency situation in accordance with Decision No 1082/2013/EU and remains so."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest. The Commission may, by means of delegated acts, extend the time period during which the measures envisaged by the proposed Regulation apply."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event of serious emergencies whose scale and scope affect the whole of the European Union, a collective, coordinated and urgent response is needed to avoid a fragmented approach that would limit the effectiveness of the Union's response. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for better European Union preparedness for future large-scale emergencies, while highlighting the limitations of the current framework. In this context, it is proposed to make further amendments to the existing legal framework in order to strengthen the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The Union Mechanism has showed encouraging results in terms of performance in each of the three pillars (prevention/preparedness/response) so far. The Mechanism has proven to be a useful tool to mobilise and coordinate the assistance provided by the Participating States responding to crises inside and outside the Union, constituting a tangible proof of European solidarity. The Mechanism is generally well perceived by the participating States and key stakeholders. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to make certain targeted amendments to Council Decision No 1313/2013/EU on the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism. Building on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility, the overall objective of this proposal is to ensure that the Union can provide a better crisis and emergency support to its citizens in Europe and beyond. The decision is to be considered in parallel with the proposal also amending this mechanism. In line with the proposal for the new MFF 2021-2027, funding related to civil protection has been integrated into a single heading: Heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’. Objectives Specifically, the proposed amendments have the following objectives: - reinforce a cross-sectoral and societal preparedness approach to trans-boundary disaster risk management, including establishing a baseline and planning elements at a European level; - ensure that the Commission is able to directly procure an adequate safety net of rescEU capacities; - provide the Commission with the logistical capacity to provide multi-purpose air services in case of emergencies and to ensure timely transport and delivery of assistance; d) design a more flexible system for response to large-scale emergencies; - enhance the Emergency Response Coordination Centre’s operational coordination and monitoring role in support of the EU’s swift and effective response to a broad range of crises inside and outside the Union. The ERCC would be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and would be at the service of the Member States and the Commission in achieving the objectives of the Union's mechanism; - enable stronger investment in preparedness at Union level and further simplification of budget implementation; - enable the financing of operations of efficient and scalable sustainable recovery and resilience measures under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism by external assigned revenues through financing made available under the draft Regulation establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal envisages the deletion of Annex I, which currently establishes the relative percentages that each pillar of the Union Mechanism (prevention, preparedness and response) should receive in terms of funding from the overall financial envelope. As the COVID-19 outbreak has shown, the percentages outlined in Annex I do not appear to ensure sufficient flexibility so that the Union can achieve the objectives it has set. The proposal stresses the need for close coordination with actions under other EU policies and instruments, in particular with the new EU programme EU4Health. Proposed budget The total budget allocated for the Union Civil Protection Mechanism amounts to EUR 3 455 902 000 (in current prices) for the 2021-2027 period: - EUR 1 268 282 000 shall derive from heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’ of the MFF 2021-2027; - EUR 2 187 620 000 shall be made available through the European Recovery Instrument based on empowerment provided in the new Own Resources Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: International maritime shipping remains the only means of transportation not included in the Union's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In 2015, it emitted 13% of the total Union greenhouse gas emissions from transport. In its Resolution of February 2014 on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, Parliament noted that all sectors of the economy would need to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions if the Union is to deliver its fair share of global efforts. In the future, seaborne trade volumes are likely to grow, which will lead to a significant increase of associated GHG emissions if mitigation measures are not put in place swiftly. According to a study from the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), depending on future economic and energy developments, global shipping emissions could grow between 50% and 250% by 2050. The aim of the EU MRV Regulation is to collect data on shipping emissions for further policymaking and to incentivise emission reductions by providing information on ships' efficiency to relevant markets. It obliges companies to monitor, report and verify the fuel consumption, CO2 emissions and energy efficiency of their ships on voyages to and from European Economic Area (EEA) ports on an annual basis, starting from 2018. Following the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change, in October 2016 the IMO adopted the legal framework for a global data collection system for fuel oil consumption of ships (“global IMO DCS”). Taking into account the coexistence of these two monitoring, reporting and verification systems, the Commission has examined how the two systems could be aligned in order to reduce the administrative burden on vessels, while preserving the objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option chosen is a partial alignment of the two monitoring, reporting and verification systems to help reduce the administrative burden on shipping companies, while preserving the key objectives of the EU MRV Regulation. However, this partial alignment should not change the EU MRV Regulation in terms of governance, the scope of the Regulation and its requirements for verification, transparency and reporting of CO2 emissions. Any amendment to the EU MRV Regulation should therefore be limited to aligning it with the IMO global data collection system for aspects relating to definitions, monitoring parameters and monitoring plans and templates. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2015/757 proposal aims at reducing the administrative burden for ships performing maritime transport activities that are covered by both the EU MRV Regulation and the global IMO DCS while preserving the specific objectives of the EU action in this area. Therefore, the proposal seeks to: · amend the definitions of ""company"" and ""reporting period"" and also the attribution of monitoring and reporting obligations in case of ""changes of company"". This will ensure that the same legal entities monitor and report according to similarly calculated reporting periods for their ships performing EEA-related maritime transport activities under the EU MRV Regulation and under the IMO's global data collection system; · amend the monitoring parameters: for this purpose, (i) the deadweight parameter should be provided, but the declaration of the ""cargo carried"" should remain optional; (ii) the parameter ""time at sea"" should be replaced by the parameter ""hours underway"" as defined in the IMO global data collection system; (iii) the ""distance travelled"" should be calculated according to the method provided by the IMO global data collection system in order to reduce the administrative burden; · streamline the content of monitoring plans to take into account the IMO's global data collection system, except for those provisions which are necessary to ensure that only EU-related data are monitored and reported under the EU MRV Regulation. Therefore, all provisions for ""per voyage"" monitoring should be maintained in the monitoring plan. On the other hand, some relevant features of the EU MRV Regulation should be maintained:  scope in terms of ships and activities covered under the EU MRV Regulation will be maintained (thus covering the majority of ships above 5000 GT calling at EU ports for maritime transport purposes); ships' CO2 emissions within Union ports are also to be monitored and reported separately. Also data on voyages internal to any EU Member State is to be monitored and reported so as to enable Member States authorities to have robust and comparable data of their national shipping emissions. Current MRV provisions on verification of data by accredited third parties are to be kept ; the EU MRV Regulation provisions on publication of individual ships' data of CO2 emissions and energy efficiency is also to be kept."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 requires new light-duty vehicles to comply with certain emission limits (Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards) and lays down additional requirements on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. Successive Euro emission standards have led to very significant drops in emissions of exhaust particles both in terms of mass (PM) and in terms of numbers (PN) and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO). However, NOx emissions--and in particular nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emissions--from road transport have not been reduced as much as expected with the introduction of Euro standards since 1991. To deal with high on-road emissions from passenger vehicles, where a significant discrepancy with the laboratory testing was observed in recent years, the Commission developed the Real Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure, which applies from 1 September 2017. In December 2018, the Court annulled certain provisions of EU legislation relating to emissions tests under real driving conditions. In its judgment, the General Court did not question the technical necessity of the compliance factors, but considered that the Commission had exceeded its implementing powers by setting the RDE compliance factors under the comitology procedure and not under the ordinary legislative procedure. It therefore cancelled the part of Regulation (EU) 2016/646 that establishes the compliance factors. The annulment is of a partial nature and the RDE test procedure remains in force and must still be conducted at type-approval. To avoid legal uncertainty on the type approvals already granted since 1 September 2017, the General Court delays the effects of the annulment by a maximum period of 12 months, (i.e. 23 February 2020) to give time to the Commission to implement the judgment. The need to adopt the current proposal results directly from the Judgement of the General Court and its swift adoption is vital in order to avoid legal uncertainty on the type approvals already granted since 1 September 2017 as well as on the future type-approvals. CONTENT: in response to a ruling by the General Court, the Commission proposes to reinsert certain aspects of Real Driving Emissions testing (RDE) into legislation to be adopted by the European Parliament and Council. In doing so, the Commission aims to provide legal certainty to national authorities, industry and consumers. In order to avoid imposing an undue burden on manufacturers who have already designed their vehicles taking into account the previously adopted RDE procedure, the Commission proposes to reinsert the conformity factors for new car models of 2.1 until 2020 and the already revised technical margin of error of 1.43 after 2020 through the legislative procedure requested by the General Court. The Commission has kept the conformity factors unaltered in order to ensure stability for national authorities and the automotive sector. In addition, the Commission also proposes that the legislator empowers the Commission to annually review downwards the conformity factors set out by the legislator, in order to reflect the progress in accuracy of the portable measuring equipment. This will allow to gradually reduce even further the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) under real driving."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy is one of the main strategic objectives of the Union. On 12 December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. The proposed Regulation implements one of the priorities set out in the Communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal and is part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which provides for specific funding under the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of cohesion policy. The Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) shall provide targeted support to the regions and sectors most affected by transition due to their dependence on fossil fuels or industrial processes that are high emitters of greenhouse gases, to help them mobilise at least EUR 100 billion over the period 2021-2027 and thus mitigate the socio-economic impact of transition. The JTM shall be additional to the contribution made by the EU budget through all instruments directly related to the transition, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund plus (ESF+). It shall have three main sources of funding: (1) a Just Transition Fund, (2) a dedicated scheme under InvestEU and (3) a Public Sector Loan Facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing the Just Transition Fund (JTF), which is one of the pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism implemented under cohesion policy. Subject matter The aim of the JTF is to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned. In line with the JTF specific objective, actions supported by the JTF should directly contribute to alleviate the impact of the transition by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy and by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment. Programming The programming process, including the identification of the territories for intervention and corresponding actions will be agreed in a dialogue between the Commission and each Member State. It will be steered by the European Semester process. Taking into account the Commission’s analysis, Member States shall prepare one or more territorial just transition plans, providing an outline of the transition process until 2030, consistent with the National Energy and Climate Plans and the transition to a climate neutral economy and identifying subsequently the most impacted territories that should be supported. The proposal also establishes a framework for measuring the achievements of the JTF using the relevant indicators and a mechanism for adjusting support if the targets are not met. Scope of support The Fund would essentially provide grants to the regions. The projects funded should contribute to a transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy. The Fund would support, inter alia, the following activities: - productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; - investments in research and innovation activities and in fostering the transfer of advanced technologies; - investments in the deployment of affordable clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energies; - investments in strengthening the circular economy, including through waste prevention and reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling; - the up-skilling and reskilling of the affected workers, with the aim of helping them to adapt to new employment opportunities, as well as providing jobsearch assistance to jobseekers and their active inclusion into the labour market. Budget The Fund shall be endowed with EUR 7.5 billion (at 2018 prices) for the period 2021-2027 in addition to what the Commission has proposed for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). It shall support the ""Investment for jobs and growth"" objective of the new regulation on common provisions (CPR) in all Member States. Member States will complement their Just Transition Fund allocation from their resources under the ERDF and the ESF+ through a specific and definitive transfer mechanism. Member States will also provide national resources to complement the Union resources. The level of Union co-financing will be set according to the category of region in which the identified territories are located. The overall financing capacity of this fund will exceed EUR 30 billion and may reach EUR 50 billion."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest. The Commission may, by means of delegated acts, extend the time period during which the measures envisaged by the proposed Regulation apply."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by concessionnaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. Considering the special position of the Channel Fixed Link as a railway link involving a single, complex engineering structure situated partly in the territory of France and of a third country respectively, it is appropriate to authorise France to enter into an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link in order to maintain a unified safety regime in the whole Tunnel, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. To this end, a proposal for a Regulation amending Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety is also being presented in parallel by the Commission. CONTENT: following a request submitted by France on 16 July 2020, this proposal aims to authorise France to negotiate an international agreement supplementing the Treaty of Canterbury with the United Kingdom to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link by maintaining a single safety authority responsible for the whole infrastructure, and to define the specific requirements that the proposed agreement must meet, such as the obligation for the Intergovernmental Commission to apply EU rules on railway safety and interoperability. The Intergovernmental Commission established by the Treaty of Canterbury shall therefore remain the single safety authority and shall continue to apply Union rules on railway safety. The aim is to ensure that the Intergovernmental Commission applies Union law on the whole of the Channel Fixed Link, including in its section under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. In accordance with the Treaty of Canterbury, disputes between France and the United Kingdom concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty of Canterbury shall be settled by an arbitration tribunal. Where such disputes raise questions relating to the interpretation of Union law, the arbitral tribunal should, in order to ensure the correct application of Union law, refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Union and defer to its decision."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has consequences for migration, security and border management in the Member States. It requires that measures be taken to support Member States in the implementation of funds by strengthening the possibility to make full use of the available implementation period until the closure of the programmes on 31 December 2023. In this respect, it is appropriate to ensure that the N+2 rule is fully used so as to provide Member States sufficient time for the implementation of their allocations and declaration of the expenditure to the Commission. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 514/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council aligns the deadlines for payment requests and decommitment and it adjusts the date of commitment of the additional allocations in 2018 and 2019, which have been granted to address unforeseen needs in the areas covered by the Asylum, Migration and Integration Funds and the Internal Security Fund. The proposed amendment aims to ensure that: - all payment requests covering the year N+2 submitted by Member State within the regulatory deadlines set out in Art. 44 of Regulation 514/2014 are taken into account when calculating the decommitment; - the implementation period of the amounts corresponding to additional allocations to the national programmes provided in 2018 and 2019 is aligned with the implementation period of the initial allocation."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is a continuation of the ‘ European Green Deal ’ which reaffirms the Commission’s ambition to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. In its Communication of 28 November 2018 ‘A clean planet for all’, the Commission already set out its strategic long-term vision of a Union with zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 through a socially fair and cost efficient transition. The European Parliament endorsed the EU's long-term objective of climate neutrality. It called for the necessary transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 at the latest, expressing the wish that this transition should become a true European success story and declared the climate and environmental urgency in its resolution of 28 November 2019. The European Council has set building a climate-neutral, green, fair and social Europe as one of the main four priorities in its Strategic Agenda for 2019-2024. It also endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral EU by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, while recognising the need to put in place an enabling framework and that the transition will require significant public and private investments. The EU has put in place a comprehensive framework of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It has already started to modernise and transform the economy with the aim of climate neutrality. Between 1990 and 2018, it reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 23%, while the economy grew by 61%. Despite efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the Commission considers it imperative to take further action, involving all sectors, as current policies are expected to only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2050. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to complement the existing policy framework by setting the long-term direction of travel and enshrining the 2050 climate-neutrality objective in EU law, enhancing adaptation efforts, establishing a process to set out and review a trajectory until 2050, regular assessment and a process in case of insufficient progress or inconsistencies. Its aim is to: - provide a direction by setting a pathway to climate neutrality, and enhance certainty and confidence on the EU’s commitment for businesses, workers, investors and consumers, as well as transparency and accountability, thus sustaining prosperity and job creation; - contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, including its long-term goal to keep the global temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to keep it to below 1.5°C as well as to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. Climate neutrality target for 2050 The proposal sets out the EU's climate neutrality objective for 2050, which covers all sectors and all greenhouse gases (not just CO2) and applies to the whole Union. It also obliges the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission and the Member States to take, at their respective levels, the necessary measures to achieve this objective. The proposal also sets out the way forward to achieve the 2050 target: - by September 2020, the Commission shall present a plan with an impact assessment to increase the EU's 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target to at least 50% and move towards 55% below 1990 levels in a responsible manner. If necessary, it shall propose amending EU climate law accordingly; - by 30 June 2021 at the latest, the Commission shall assess and propose to revise, if appropriate, all relevant policy instruments in order to achieve the additional greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030. Trajectory towards climate neutrality For the period 2030 to 2050, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to supplement this Regulation by setting out a trajectory at Union level to achieve over time the 2050 objective. The Commission shall review the EU trajectory every 5 years. Under the Paris Agreement, the Parties periodically take stock of the implementation of the Paris Agreement and assess the collective progress made in achieving its purpose and long-term goals (the so-called ‘global stocktaking’ exercise). At the latest within six months of each global stocktake, the Commission shall review the trajectory. Adaptation to climate change The proposal obliges the relevant EU institutions and Member States to ensure that steady progress is made in improving adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change. To this end, Member States shall adopt comprehensive national adaptation strategies and plans. Regular assessment By 30 September 2023 at the latest, and every five years thereafter, the Commission shall assess the progress made, in line with the deadlines set out in the Paris Agreement. If the assessment shows that EU measures are inconsistent or inadequate in relation to the objective pursued, or that progress is insufficient, the Commission shall take appropriate action. The Commission shall also regularly assess relevant national measures and issue recommendations where it finds inconsistencies or that measures are inadequate. Public participation The Commission shall engage in dialogue with all parts of society to empower them to take action for a climate-neutral society. Each Member State shall establish a multilevel climate and energy dialogue pursuant to national rules, in which all relevant stakeholders and the general public are able actively to engage and discuss the achievement of the Union’s climate-neutrality objective."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that under certain conditions field inspections carried out on certain seed-producing crops in the listed third countries are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that under certain conditions seed of certain species of cereal produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Ukraine has submitted a request to the Commission for equivalence as regards its system of field inspection of cereal seed producing crops and in respect of cereal seed produced and certified in Ukraine. Following that request, the Commission examined the relevant Ukrainian legislation and carried out an audit of the field inspections and seed certification system for cereal seed in place in Ukraine. It was concluded that its requirements and system in place are equivalent to the ones of the Union and offer the same assurance as the Union’s system. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Decision 2003/17/EC aims to grant equivalence as regards field inspections carried in respect of cereal seed in Ukraine and as regards cereal seed produced in Ukraine and officially certified by its authorities. The proposal fully meets the objectives of the EU/Ukraine Association Agreement as it shall boost trade in seed which complies with EU rules. According to the Commission, equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU. Moreover, European seed companies seek new opportunities, which would be provided for by the EU equivalence. The proposal has no impact on compliance costs for operators."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components for L-category vehicles and a sizeable drop in demand for those vehicles. This has led to important delays for manufacturers to clear their stock of Euro 4 vehicles that, according to Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, need to be registered before the application of the environmental Euro 5 step on 1 January 2021. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, motorcycles sales have been highly impacted. Because of Member States authorities’ lockdowns, sales could not take place during the peak season. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553 700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020. During the lockdowns, sales went down by 98% and remained sluggish since then. It is therefore likely that not all Euro 4 vehicles currently in stock will be sold by the end of the year. The end-of-series provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 allow manufacturers to continue to make available on the market, register or enter into service a limited part of a stock of L-category vehicles which cannot be made available on the market or can no longer be made available on the market, owing to the entry into force of new technical requirements against which those vehicles have not been approved. Considering the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is apparent that the provisions on end-of-series do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address the amount of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that manufacturers will have in stock following the application of the environmental Euro 5 step. CONTENT: in the context of the current COVID-19 epidemic, the main purpose of the proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 is to adapt the provisions relating to the number of end-of-series vehicles in order to allow dealers to sell higher amounts of their stock of Euro 4 vehicles in 2021 only. In order to ensure that the application of these measures is restricted to vehicles that were in stock at the moment of the national lockdowns, the amount of vehicles benefiting from these specific end-of-series measures shall not exceed the number of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that were in stock on 15 March 2020. This proposal: - shall not increase pollutant emissions as the flexibility shall be limited to already produced vehicles at the time of the lockdown; - avoid the need to unnecessarily scrap vehicles that would have been otherwise placed on the market in absence of the crisis; - shall not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a single common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation. These proposals give shape to the reflections on the future of the CAP presented in the Commission Communication on the future of food and agriculture in November 2017, which highlighted the challenges, objectives and possible avenues for a 'future-proof' CAP, that needs to be simpler, smarter and more modern, leading to the transition to a more sustainable agriculture. CONTENT: this proposal lays down rules on the objectives to be pursued through Union support financed by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) under the CAP. It also defines the new working method covering direct payments to farmers, rural development support and sectoral support programmes. Objectives adapted to the new priorities : the CAP general objectives shall focus on the economic viability, the resilience and income of farms, on an enhanced environmental and climate performance, and on the strengthened socio-economic fabric of rural areas. The future CAP shall focus on nine specific objectives: support viable farm income and resilience across the EU territory to enhance food security; enhance market orientation and increase competitiveness including greater focus on research, technology and digitalisation; improve farmers' position in the value chain; contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as sustainable energy; foster sustainable development and efficient management of natural resources such as water, soil and air; contribute to the protection of biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services and preserve habitats and landscapes; attract young farmers and facilitate business development in rural areas; promote employment, growth, social inclusion and local development in rural areas, including bio-economy and sustainable forestry; improve the response of EU agriculture to societal demands on food and health, including safe, nutritious and sustainable food, as well as animal welfare. Moreover, fostering knowledge, innovation and digitalisation in agriculture and rural areas is a cross-cutting objective. To deliver on these objectives Member States shall ensure simplification and performance of CAP support. Greater flexibility for Member States : Member States shall have a certain level of flexibility for transfers between allocations. The focus shall be less on rules and compliance and more on results and performance. This approach will give far greater freedom to Member States to decide how best to meet the common objectives at the same time as responding to the specific needs of their farmers, rural communities and society at large. Member States shall present their proposed interventions to achieve the EU specific objectives in a CAP strategic plan. In the plans, Member States shall set targets on what they want to achieve in the programming period using commonly defined result indicators. The Commission shall assess the proposed CAP strategic plans to ensure the consistency and coherence with the general principles of Union law and the protection of the internal market. Once the CAP strategic plans are established, Member States shall annually report on the progress made in the implementation. The Member States and Commission will monitor progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. Better targeting of aid : direct payments shall remain an essential part of the policy, as farmers' income needs to be supported to foster a smart and resilient agricultural sector. Priority shall be given to supporting small and medium-sized farms and young farmers. Income support should be targeted to genuine farmers. The proposal provides inter alia for: a reduction of payments as of EUR 60 000 and compulsory capping for payments above EUR 100 000 per farm, with the possibility for Member States to deduct labour costs from the amount of direct payments; the possibility of granting a higher level of support per hectare for small and medium-sized farms; the obligation for Member States to allocate at least 2% of their direct payment allocation to attract young farmers. Member States should be allowed to use part of their financial ceiling available for direct payments for coupled income support in order to improve competitiveness, sustainability, and/or quality in certain sectors and productions that are particularly important for social, economic or environmental reasons and undergo certain difficulties. More ambitious environmental and climate objectives : direct payments shall be conditional on increased environmental and climate requirements. A new system of so-called ‘eco-schemes’, funded from national direct payment allocations, will be mandatory for Member States, although farmers will not be obliged to join them. These eco-schemes will have to address the CAP environment and climate objectives in ways that complement the other relevant tools available and go beyond what is already requested under the conditionality requirements. Member States will be required to dedicate at least 30% of their rural development budget to environment and climate measures. 40% of the total CAP budget shall contribute to climate action. For rural development, it is proposed to rebalance the financing between the EU and Member States’ budgets. Less developed regions should continue to benefit from higher co-financing rates, which will also apply to certain interventions such as LEADER and the payments for management commitments. Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of respective direct payments to EAFRD allocation and vice versa. A higher percentage can be transferred from direct payments to EAFRD allocation for interventions addressing environmental and climate objectives and installation grants for young farmers. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21). On the basis of the Commission proposal for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission is presenting a set of regulations which define the legislative framework of the CAP for the period 2021-2027, namely: a regulation defining the objectives of the CAP as well as rules on support for strategic plans to be developed by Member States in the framework of the CAP; a horizontal regulation on the financing, management and monitoring of the CAP; and a common organisation of the markets (CMO) Regulation.

CONTENT: this proposal for a horizontal regulation of the CAP seeks to maintain the current structure of the CAP in two pillars with annual measures of general application in Pillar I (direct payments) complemented by measures reflecting the national and regional specificities under a multi-annual programming approach in Pillar II (rural development). The financing of the various CAP interventions and measures from the Union budget is provided by (i) the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and (ii) the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). Increased subsidiarity for Member States : the new design of the CAP for post 2020 will point to an increased subsidiarity so that Member States can better tailor implementing measures under both Pillars to their realities and farmers' concrete circumstances. On this basis, the current CAP Horizontal Regulation is adapted to the new delivery model and reflects more flexibility for Member States in implementing the policy (in line with their local needs), less bureaucracy for beneficiaries and shift to a performance-based policy. Setting targets at EU level : the move at EU level from an emphasis on compliance to performance requires a clear identification of the objectives which the policy has to achieve: again, these objectives shall be established at EU level. In order to advance towards a more result-driven policy mechanism, there shall be a shift from assurance on legality and regularity of the underlying transactions to assurance on performance and the respect of EU basic requirements, like (IACS) or the governance bodies (paying agencies, coordinating bodies, competent authorities and certification bodies). The robust and reliable governance structures which characterise the CAP will be maintained. Controls and sanctions : in addition to financing provisions, the CAP Horizontal Regulation continues to have provisions on general principles for checks and penalties, checks for conditionality and the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS). A new system of ‘conditionality’ shall link all farmers' income support (and other area- and animal-based payments) to the application of environment- and climate-friendly farming practices. Accordingly, the proposed Regulation lays down rules on financing, management and control systems, clearance processes (annual financial clearance and annual performance clearance) and conformity procedure. Simplification : in line with the new delivery model, an annual performance clearance shall be established in order to check the eligibility of the expenditure in relation to the reported outputs. The proposal also provides for a reduction in the number of paying agencies and strengthens the role of the coordinating body and the certification body. It introduces the concept of the single audit approach and provides that the number of audits carried out by the Commission can be reduced.

Agricultural reserve : a new agricultural reserve shall be established in the EAGF, to provide additional support for the agricultural sector for the purpose of safety-net measures in the context of market management or stabilisation and/or in case of crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution. The amount of the reserve shall be at least EUR 400 million at the beginning of each financial year. Non-committed appropriations of the agricultural reserve shall be carried over without time limitation to finance the agricultural reserve in the following financial years. Transfer of allocations : Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of their CAP allocations between direct payments and rural development and vice versa, to ensure the financing of their priorities and measures."

A new system of ‘conditionality’ shall link all farmers' income support (and other area- and animal-based payments) to the application of environment- and climate-friendly farming practices. Accordingly, the proposed Regulation lays down rules on financing, management and control systems, clearance processes (annual financial clearance and annual performance clearance) and conformity procedure. Simplification : in line with the new delivery model, an annual performance clearance shall be established in order to check the eligibility of the expenditure in relation to the reported outputs. The proposal also provides for a reduction in the number of paying agencies and strengthens the role of the coordinating body and the certification body. It introduces the concept of the single audit approach and provides that the number of audits carried out by the Commission can be reduced. AVAILABLE BUDGET: the Commission proposal on the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 provides that a significant part of the EU budget should continue to be dedicated to agriculture, which is a common policy of strategic importance. Thus, in current prices, it is proposed that the CAP should focus on its core activities with EUR 286.2 billion allocated to the EAGF and EUR 78.8 billion for the EAFRD. These agricultural funds are complemented by additional funding from Horizon Europe, as the proposed envelope for this programme includes EUR 10 billion to support research and innovation in food, agriculture, rural development and the bioeconomy. Agricultural reserve : a new agricultural reserve shall be established in the EAGF, to provide additional support for the agricultural sector for the purpose of safety-net measures in the context of market management or stabilisation and/or in case of crises affecting the agricultural production or distribution. The amount of the reserve shall be at least EUR 400 million at the beginning of each financial year. Non-committed appropriations of the agricultural reserve shall be carried over without time limitation to finance the agricultural reserve in the following financial years. Transfer of allocations : Member States shall have the possibility to transfer up to 15% of their CAP allocations between direct payments and rural development and vice versa, to ensure the financing of their priorities and measures."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the context in which the last CAP reform was decided in 2013 has shifted considerably. More specifically: (i) agricultural prices have fallen sharply as a result of macroeconomic factors and geopolitical tensions; (ii) the EU has become more open to global markets; (iii) the EU has made new commitments at international level, for example on climate change mitigation (through COP 21).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council stated that Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan entities should be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. By introducing exceptional trade measures in favour of the countries and territories participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process, Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, which applies until 31 December 2020, has allowed such liberalisation. Stabilisation and Association Agreements have now been concluded with all six relevant entities of the Western Balkans, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Even though most of the trade preferences initially granted to the Western Balkans through the autonomous trade regime have now been integrated in their respective Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union, the limited preferences granted through this Regulation still provide a valuable support to the regional economy. These preferences allow for the suspension of the specific duties normally applied to fruits and vegetables and for the inclusion of a global wine quota available after exhaustion of the countries’ respective national wine quotas. The ATMs system contributed to the expansion of the total trade between the EU and the Western Balkans which exceeded EUR 54 billion in 2018. The EU is the leading trade partner accounting for over 72% of the region's total trade. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the period of application of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2025. The proposed measures have been in place for almost 20 years, but are now considerably reduced, as most of the preferences have been gradually integrated into the various Stabilisation and Association Agreements concluded between the EU and the beneficiaries. While the estimated impact is considered minimal in terms of loss of customs duties for the EU - around EUR 23.5 million for all six beneficiaries, based on the import value in 2018 - the extension of the measures is considered the best guarantee of the EU's commitment to the trade integration of the Western Balkans. It would also help to ensure stable market access conditions for economic operators both in the region and in the EU. The unilateral preferences to Kosovo were included in the EU-Kosovo Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which entered into force on 1 April 2016. The autonomous trade preferences do no longer concern any fishery or beef trade concessions. It is therefore proposed to remove any references to these two categories of products. This proposal is consistent with the political guidelines of the new Commission, which has reaffirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkans and its important role in the continued reform process across the region. The European Union aims to promote peace, stability and economic development in the region and open up the prospect of EU integration. Budgetary implications The proposed Regulation does not incur additional costs in the EU budget. For the years 2020 to 2025 there will be no additional tariff revenue foregone in respect of products produced by the current beneficiaries. Hypothetical revenue that could have been collected from additional new imports is not considered as a loss of tariff revenue."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between the European Union and Seychelles was signed on 28 February 2007 and entered into force on 2 November 2007 for a duration of six years. The agreement is tacitly renewable, and is therefore still in force. The current 6-year Protocol to the FPA entered into application on 18th January 2014 and will expire on 17th January 2020. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Seychelles with a view to concluding, on behalf of the European Union, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and its Implementing Protocol (2020-2026). At the end of the negotiations, an Agreement and Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 22 October 2019. The new Agreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of six years as does the new Protocol. The purpose of this proposal is to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol CONTENT: the main aim of the new Agreement is to provide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to continuing and reinforcing the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Seychelles in the field of fisheries. The aim of the Implementing Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone in accordance with the best available scientific advice and the resolutions and recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone and in the Indian Ocean, in the interest of both parties. In addition, this cooperation will also contribute to promote decent working conditions in fisheries activities. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 40 tuna purse seine vessels; - 8 surface longliners; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant IOTC resolutions. The conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol enables to continue and reinforce the strategic fisheries partnership between the European Union and Seychelles. It will create fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone. It will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the Fisheries Comprehensive Plan, the monitoring and combating illegal fishing, and the support for the small-scale fisheries sector. Lastly, the Agreement and the Protocol will contribute to Seychelles’ sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and to Seychelles’ fishing economy by promoting growth and decent working conditions, associated with fishing-related economic activities. Budgetary implications The EU annual financial contribution is EUR 5 300 000, based on: - an annual amount for access to the fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone of EUR 2 500 000 equivalent to a reference tonnage, for highly migratory species, of 50 000 tonnes per year; - support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Seychelles, amounting to EUR 2 800 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of Seychelles’ Fisheries Comprehensive Plan. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure, including for the reserve line for protocols not having entered into force at the beginning of the year."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 10 September 2010, the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China with a view to reaching a broad and ambitious agreement on cooperation on geographical indications and their protection. The conclusion of the Agreement is part of the EU’s overall strategy to promote the EU’s policy on geographical indications. The initiative aims to provide a high level of protection, at least at the level provided for in Article 23 of the TRIPS+ Agreement, for a range of EU GIs to be protected in the People's Republic of China and Chinese GIs to be protected in the EU. This initiative shall give a competitive advantage to producers of GI products. CONTENT: the Council's draft aims to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement between the EU and China on cooperation on, and protection of, geographical indications. The Agreement establishes the conditions for a high level of protection on the Chinese market for the proposed geographical indications. In line with the objectives set out in the negotiating directives, the Commission secured: - a TRIPs-plus level of protection to EU geographical indications following the entry into force of the Agreement which provides protection against translation, transcription or transliteration, and against the use of the said geographical indications accompanied by expressions such as ‘kind’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘imitation’ or the like in respect of a non-originating product; - the protection of 175 additional geographical indications within four years of entry into force and a mechanism to add more geographical indications thereafter; - the coexistence of geographical indications with legitimate earlier trademarks of which the vast majority belong to the legitimate owners of Europe. The Agreement establishes a Joint Committee to amend the Annexes to the Agreement. The Council shall authorise the Commission to approve, on behalf of the Union, in the Joint Committee, modifications to Annexes I and III to VI to the Agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while Member States are responsible for their health policies, the experience gained during the COVID-19 crisis has shown the need to significantly strengthen the EU's capacity to respond effectively to major health threats. Europe needs to give higher priority to health, to have health systems ready to provide state-of-the-art care and to be prepared to deal with epidemics and other unpredictable health threats, in line with the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Commission proposes that an ambitious stand-alone programme, called the EU4Health Programme, is the key instrument to implement this strategy. The new programme will be essential to ensure that the EU remains the healthiest region in the world, that it has all possible tools to address health challenges at national and European level and that it is ready to respond to any new and emerging health threats that may endanger the population of the EU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to establish a new programme for EU action in the field of health, entitled ‘EU4Health Programme’ (EU4Health) for the period 2021-2027. General objectives The Programme shall pursue the following general objectives: (1) protect people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health; (2) improve the availability in the Union of medicines, medical devices and other crisis relevant products, contribute to their affordability, and support innovation; (3) strengthen health systems and the healthcare workforce, including by digital transformation and by increased integrated and coordinated work among the Member States, sustained implementation of best practice and data sharing, to increase the general level of public health. From the point of view of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, the Programme should help to ensure that the EU is better prepared to deal with future health threats that would affect all or a large part of its territory. The Programme shall: - support Member States in the transition to better preparedness and the reinforcement of their health systems and support them in achieving the health-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); - set out key action areas such as improvement of national health systems, measures against communicable and non-communicable diseases, availability and affordability of medicines and other crisis relevant products; - address inequalities by benchmarking, providing support and closing identified gaps between countries, regions, population groups and citizens; - provide tools for enhanced solidarity in preparedness and crisis response, as well as in finding common ground to improve prevention and in addressing non-communicable diseases, and in particular cancer, and for better coordinating between different policies, tools and financial instruments; - contribute to tackling the negative impact of climate change and environmental degradation on human health; - support actions to enable the Commission to complement the necessary regulatory framework and contribute to addressing the significant structural needs identified in the COVID-19 crisis. Implementation The Programme shall be implemented through direct or indirect management and shall make use of the most commonly used spending mechanisms of the Union budget, including public procurement, prizes and grants.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while Member States are responsible for their health policies, the experience gained during the COVID-19 crisis has shown the need to significantly strengthen the EU's capacity to respond effectively to major health threats. Europe needs to give higher priority to health, to have health systems ready to provide state-of-the-art care and to be prepared to deal with epidemics and other unpredictable health threats, in line with the International Health Regulations (IHR). The Commission proposes that an ambitious stand-alone programme, called the EU4Health Programme, is the key instrument to implement this strategy. The new programme will be essential to ensure that the EU remains the healthiest region in the world, that it has all possible tools to address health challenges at national and European level and that it is ready to respond to any new and emerging health threats that may endanger the population of the EU. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to establish a new programme for EU action in the field of health, entitled ‘EU4Health Programme’ (EU4Health) for the period 2021-2027. General objectives The Programme shall pursue the following general objectives: (1) protect people in the Union from serious cross-border threats to health; (2) improve the availability in the Union of medicines, medical devices and other crisis relevant products, contribute to their affordability, and support innovation; (3) strengthen health systems and the healthcare workforce, including by digital transformation and by increased integrated and coordinated work among the Member States, sustained implementation of best practice and data sharing, to increase the general level of public health. From the point of view of recovery from the COVID-19 crisis, the Programme should help to ensure that the EU is better prepared to deal with future health threats that would affect all or a large part of its territory. The Programme shall: - support Member States in the transition to better preparedness and the reinforcement of their health systems and support them in achieving the health-related United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); - set out key action areas such as improvement of national health systems, measures against communicable and non-communicable diseases, availability and affordability of medicines and other crisis relevant products; - address inequalities by benchmarking, providing support and closing identified gaps between countries, regions, population groups and citizens; - provide tools for enhanced solidarity in preparedness and crisis response, as well as in finding common ground to improve prevention and in addressing non-communicable diseases, and in particular cancer, and for better coordinating between different policies, tools and financial instruments; - contribute to tackling the negative impact of climate change and environmental degradation on human health; - support actions to enable the Commission to complement the necessary regulatory framework and contribute to addressing the significant structural needs identified in the COVID-19 crisis. Implementation The Programme shall be implemented through direct or indirect management and shall make use of the most commonly used spending mechanisms of the Union budget, including public procurement, prizes and grants. Funding for health under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027 includes several instruments such as the European Social Fund plus (ESF+), the European Regional Development Fund, the Horizon Europe Programme, the Digital Europe Programme and the Interconnection in Europe 2 mechanism.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while investment conditions in Europe have improved since the launch of the Juncker plan in 2014, thanks to a more favourable economic situation and government interventions such as the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), there is still a significant investment gap in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major shock to the world and EU economies. The contraction of EU GDP in 2020 - forecast at around 7.5% - is expected to be much deeper than during the 2009 financial crisis. For the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission therefore considers it necessary to propose a reinforced EU investment programme to provide crucial support to businesses and to ensure a strong focus of private investors on the Union's medium and long-term priorities, including the Green Deal for Europe and digital transitions, as well as increased resilience. This is why the Commission is withdrawing its May 2018 proposal for the InvestEU programme and submitting a new proposal that takes full account of the partial agreement reached in April 2019 between the Parliament and the Council. This new proposal (i) increases the amount of the initially proposed financial envelope (ii) amends the scope of the proposal to reflect on the post-pandemic needs of the European economy. It builds on the lessons learned from the EFSI evaluations and previous financial instruments (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020, COSME, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme etc.). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to bring together under a single structure all financing from the EU budget in the form of loans and guarantees. The InvestEU programme shall be based on the following elements: The InvestEU Fund The InvestEU Fund shall mobilise public and private investment through a EU budget guarantee of EUR 75 153 850 000 (in current prices) which aims to support the investment projects of implementing partners. The Commission proposes that the guarantee be provisioned at 45%, which means that EUR 33 800 000 000 from the EU budget shall be set aside in case calls are made on the guarantee. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group shall remain a privileged implementing partner for the Invest EU. It shall implement 75% of the EU guarantee. National development banks or institutions may also become implementing partners. Five policy windows The InvestEU Fund shall operate through 5 policy windows, each of which is aimed at addressing market failures or investment shortfalls within their specific scope: 1. sustainable infrastructure; 2. research, innovation and digitisation; 3. SMEs; 4. social investment and skills; 5. strategic European investments. In addition to increasing the resources of the sustainable infrastructure window, the Commission proposes to broaden the scope of the programme by adding a fifth strand - strategic European investment - with a view to meeting the future needs of the European economy and promoting and ensuring the strategic autonomy of the Union in key sectors. This window shall be endowed with an amount of up to EUR 31 153 850 000. This new window shall support final recipients established in a Member State and carrying out an activity of strategic importance to the Union, in particular with a view to green and digital transitions and increased resilience in areas such as: - provision of critical health care, manufacturing and stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and medical supplies, strengthening the capacity to respond to health crises; - critical infrastructure (e.g. energy, transport, environment, health, 5G, Internet of Things); - key enabling, transformative, green and digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, block chains, renewable energy technologies, biomedicine). The InvestEU Advisory Hub The advisory hub would provide technical support and assistance in the preparation, development, structuring and implementation of projects, including capacity-building. The EIB Group would play a central role in the implementation of advisory support under the Hub. A financial envelope of EUR 724 733 000 (in current prices) is foreseen for the InvestEU Advisory Hub. The InvestEU Portal The InvestEU Portal shall be established to provide for an easily accessible and user-friendly project database to promote visibility of investment projects searching for financing with enhanced focus on the provision of a possible pipeline of investment projects, compatible with Union law and policies. Governance An investment committee of independent experts shall remain responsible for approving individual requests. The Commission performs a policy check on proposed financing or investment operations to verify that they are compliant with EU law before a proposal is submitted to the Investment Committee. Budgetary implications For the period 2021-2027, the budgetary framework (commitments at current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU programme amounts to EUR 33 524 733 000. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 33 800 million, of which EUR 1 billion will be covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council.

The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has consequences for trade in dual-use items between the EU and the UK: under Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, the export of dual-use items from the EU to the UK will, as from 1 January 2021, require an export authorisation issued by the national competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is established.

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption."

BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland annexed to the Withdrawal Agreement reiterates that Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the United Kingdom, and that nothing in the Protocol prevents the United Kingdom from including Northern Ireland in the territorial scope of its Schedules of Concessions annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (‘GATT 1994’). This means that despite Northern Ireland being formally in the United Kingdom’s customs territory, the United Kingdom, in respect of Northern Ireland, is obliged to apply the Union’s customs legislation as if Northern Ireland were still in the Union’s customs territory. The bilateral arrangements between the Union and the United Kingdom under the Protocol do not give rise to rights and obligations for third countries. Consequently, any imports pursuant to Union import tariff rate quotas or other import quotas applying to goods originating in a third country brought into Northern Ireland could not be counted towards that third country’s rights vis-à-vis the Union, unless agreed by the third country. That situation poses a risk to the proper functioning of the Union’s Single Market and the integrity of the Common Commercial Policy through the possible circumvention of the Union’s tariff rate quotas or other import quotas. To address that risk, the Union’s import tariff rate quotas and other import quotas should be available only for goods imported and released into free circulation in the Union and not in Northern Ireland. Any agreement of the Union with a third country providing for export tariff rate quotas applies only to goods imported within the Union. Therefore, that third country could refuse to issue export licenses for direct imports into Northern Ireland. By virtue of the Protocol, this Regulation also applies to and in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland. CONTENT: under the proposed Regulation, the Union’s tariff rate quotas and other import quotas on imports should be available only for goods imported from outside of the Union and released into free circulation in the Union. The proposal lists the relevant customs territories, which make up the Union customs territory. This list does not include Northern Ireland, which has the effect that the Union’s tariff rate quotas and other import quotas would not be available for imports into Northern Ireland. The Regulation should start the day following the end of transition period, on 1 January 2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the US have a close trade and investment relationship. Bilateral trade in goods and services between them amounts to more than EUR 1000 billion per year, or EUR 3 billion per day. On 21 August 2020 Commissioner Hogan and US Trade Representative Lighthizer stated their intention to go ahead with a trade-facilitating package to eliminate or reduce customs duties for a small number of tariff lines covering EUR 168 million (approximatively USD 200 million) in EU and US exports. The Commission therefore proposes to create additional opportunities for EU and US operators by eliminating or reducing tariffs. It sees this initiative as a first step to de-escalate bilateral trade tensions and to support the settlement of on-going disputes. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to eliminate a number of customs tariffs on lobster. Lobster is not sensitive products for the EU, which is a net importer of these products. EU producers supply less than 5% of European consumption. The elimination of import duties shall support the food-processing industry and the hospitality sector. In return, the US has committed to ease market access for EU27 exports worth EUR 143 million (USD 160 million) on average in the past three years, through a 50% reduction of duties. These include products such as prepared meals, certain crystal glassware, surface preparations, propellant powders, cigarette lighters and lighter parts. The US requested the tariff reduction for lobster in light of its declining exports of the product to Europe and the world. The tariff reductions should be implemented in a fully WTO consistent manner and respect the most-favoured nation (MFN) principle. The measures shall apply retroactively as of 1 August 2020 and end on 31 July 2025. The agreement shall have a limited negative impact on the budget of the EU in the form of foregone customs duties due to tariff liberalisation for the products covered by the tariff lines in annex to this Regulation, representing some EUR 5.3 million in duties collected from the US (average 2017-2019 period)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaries of a Channel fixed link, signed in Canterbury on 12 February 1986, established an intergovernmental committee to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transition period set out in the withdrawal agreement, unless otherwise provided, EU law will no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and, as regards the part of the Channel Fixed Link under French jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be a national safety authority under Union law. The safety authorisations for the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager and safety certificates for railway undertakings operating through the Fixed Link issued by the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be valid. By Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council, France was empowered to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety and interoperability rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link, with the aim of maintaining a unified safety regime. However, it is unlikely that such agreement will enter into force by the end of the transition period. In the light of the economic importance of the Channel Fixed Link to the EU, it is essential that the Channel Fixed Link continue to operate after 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in view of the end of the transitional period referred to in the withdrawal agreement, the proposed Regulation lays down transitional provisions for certain safety certificates and safety approvals issued under Directive 2004/49/EC and for certain licences of railway undertakings issued under Directive 2012/34/EU. In concrete terms, the proposal: - extends the validity of safety authorisations of the infrastructure manager by two months and the validity of safety certificates and licences of railway undertakings by nine months; - also extends by nine months the validity of the operating licences issued by the United Kingdom under Directive 2012/34/EU in order to allow railway undertakings to continue to operate up to the Calais-Fréthun border-crossing station and thus ensure connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom; - provides that such authorisations, certificates and licences are subject to Directive (EU) 2016/798 and Directive 2012/34/EU respectively and requires their holders of to cooperate with the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority and provide the necessary information; the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority must monitor that the holders of these authorisations, certificates and licences comply with EU law; - confers implementing powers on the Commission to withdraw the benefit conferred on the holders of the approvals/certificates and licences in question, where compliance with EU requirements is not ensured."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), to which the Union has been a contracting party since 2006, is the regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of resources of tuna and tuna-like species in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, established by the Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission established by the 1949 Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica (the IATTC Convention). The IATTC is empowered to adopt decisions (resolutions) to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the IATTC Convention Area. IATTC resolutions are binding on the Contracting Parties. They also impose obligations on private operators (e.g. vessel masters). The EU has an average of three purse-seiners and thirty-some longliners operating in the IATTC Convention area. The main stocks targeted by the EU fleet are tropical tunas and swordfish. The provisions of some IATTC Resolutions were last transposed through Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 of 7 May 2007 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species. The proposal aims to take into account changes that have occurred since the adoption of that Regulation but which have not yet been covered by EU law. CONTENT: the proposal for amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 lays down management, conservation and control measures relating to fishing in the IATTC Convention Area and for stocks of tuna and tuna-like species, other species of fish caught by vessels fishing for tuna and tuna-like species and species belonging to the same ecosystem. The Regulation shall apply to EU vessels fishing in the IATTC Convention area. The proposed Regulation: - deals with conservation and management measures, including provisions relevant to purse-seine vessels fishing for tropical tuna, prohibition of fishing on data buoys, provisions concerning fishing in the vicinity of Fish Aggregating Devices, their deployment, design and set of rules for transhipment in port; - sets out measures designed to protect certain marine species present in the area covered by the IATTC Convention, such as oceanic white-tip, silky, and hammerhead sharks and mobulid rays. These measures include data provision and release duties, as well as measures related to the protection of sea turtles and seabirds; - contains provisions for the IATTC observer scheme; - sets vessel requirements, including those related to the IATTC Regional Vessel Register, to reporting duties and to the protocol for the sealing of wells; - contains information on the reporting duties related to the data statistical programme, and requirements for the bigeye tuna document programme; - provides for delegated powers granted to the Commission to cater for amendments to measures, which are expected to be frequent and to make sure that Union fishing vessels are put on equal footing with vessels of other Contracting Parties to the IATTC."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 8 July 2019, the Council adopted the mandate authorising the European Commission to open negotiations for the renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement, which expires on 15 November 2019. On 8 November 2019, the Protocol was extended for a period of one year by an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters, until 15 November 2020 by means of Council Decision (EU) 2020/742. Due to the current health context (COVID -19 pandemic) the ongoing negotiations for the renewal of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol will not be concluded in time to avoid a disruption of fishing activities at the end of this extension. In this context, on 26 June 20203 the Council therefore authorised the Commission to negotiate a further extension to the Protocol for a maximum duration of one more year. CONTENT: in order to prevent an interruption of fishing activity for the European fleet operating in Mauritanian waters, the Council Decision endorsing this agreement in the form of an exchange of letters must be adopted in due time to allow for signature by both Parties before 15 November 2020, when the current Protocol expires. The aim of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters is to enable the European Union and Mauritania to continue working together to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and a sound exploitation of fishery resources in Mauritanian waters and to allow EU vessels to fish in those waters. Fishing opportunities The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 25 vessels; -Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Tuna seiners: 12 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels; - Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers: 225 000 tonnes and 19 vessels; - Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 61 625 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 57 500 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of Mauritania’s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 4 125 000 per year for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of Mauritania’s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The exchange of letters regarding the extension also sets out a pro rata reduction in case the negotiations for the renewal of the Partnership Agreement and its Protocol result in their signature, leading to their application, before the annual extension covered by the exchange of letters expires."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 7 July 2020, the Council adopted a mandate authorising the European Commission to open negotiations for a new protocol to the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands and for the possible prolongation of the current protocol to that Agreement, which will expire on 13 October 2020. In view of the complexity of the negotiations on a new Protocol to the Partnership Agreement on sustainable fisheries between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands, the two parties agreed on an extension of the current Protocol for a maximum period of one year, in accordance with the Council mandate. This extension was established by an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters, initialled on 29 July 2020 in Brussels and Rarotonga (Cook Islands). The extension of the Protocol to the existing Agreement would make it possible to avoid interrupting the fishing activities of European vessels when the protocol expires on 13 October 2020, pending the finalisation of the negotiations on the renewal of the protocol. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands concerning the extension for one year of the framework established by the Protocol expiring on 13 October 2020. The aim of the Agreement is also to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Cook Islands, in the interests of both parties. The current EU-Cook Islands protocol allows the EU fleet to fish in the Cook Islands waters for tuna species, for indicative annual fishing opportunities of 7 000 tonnes. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 700 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 350 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of the Cook Islands’ sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 350 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of the Cook Islands’ national policy on the sustainable management of their maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of targeted contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ""reciprocity"", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union. Consequently, authorisations would only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them."

In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ""reciprocity"", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union. Consequently, authorisations would only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s legislative proposals on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 aimed to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change or generational renewal, while continuing to support farmers in the Union for a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Those proposals are closely linked to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) of the Union for the years 2021 to 2027. The legislative procedure was not concluded in time to allow Member States and the Commission to prepare all elements necessary to apply the new legal framework and the CAP Strategic Plans as of 1 January 2021, as initially proposed by the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure that support can be granted to farmers and other beneficiaries from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in 2021, the Union should continue to grant such support for one more year under the conditions of the existing legal framework, which covers the period 2014 to 2020. CONTENT: this proposal aims at providing certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and ensuring the continuity of support for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new CAP becomes applicable. In order to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations at national level, these changes would need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by mid-2020 Extension of the applicability of the existing regulations The existing legal framework is laid down in particular in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013, (EU) No 1307/2013, (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition, to facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework which covers the period starting on 1 January 2022, rules shall be laid down to regulate how certain support granted on a multiannual basis will be integrated into the new legal framework. In light of the fact that the Union should continue to support rural development in 2021, Member States, that demonstrate the risk to run out of funds and not to be able to undertake new legal commitments in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, shall have the possibility to extend their rural development programmes or certain of their regional rural development programmes supported by the EAFRD to 31 December 2021 and to finance those extended programmes from the corresponding budget allocation for the year 2021. Transition to the next CAP period The new CAP comes with significant changes. Transitional rules are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period, in particular concerning the continuation of multiannual commitments undertaken in the current and previous programming periods. The Single CMO Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, including aid schemes for specific sectors. It sets out the parameters for intervening on agricultural markets and providing sector-specific support. To ensure coherence, most interventions of the new CAP will be part of one strategic CAP support plan per Member State, including several sectorial interventions that have previously been set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Under the current rules, the different sectoral programmes follow different time frames. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between the aid schemes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions under the new CAP it is necessary to set rules regarding the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector and in the olive oil and table olives sector, it is necessary to regulate the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes. Budgetary implications The current Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 on rural development and (EU) No 1307/2013 on direct payments do not lay down allocations for the transitional period (beyond calendar year 2020). Therefore, the initiative has a budgetary impact in the sense that it adds the allocations for direct payments and rural development for the relevant transitional period to ensure smooth continuity. These allocations are equal to those in the CAP Plan proposal and they are coherent with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027. Where Member States do not decide to prolong their current rural development programmes, the 2021 EAFRD allocations will be transferred to the 2022 – 2025 EAFRD allocations. Similarly, for the transitional period, the allocations contained in Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 need to be adjusted to respect the overall amounts for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) included in the MFF proposal. The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. It is to be financed through financial discipline applied on direct payments. As such, it does not entail any additional expenditure. The present proposal is neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments. The impact as regards the estimated schedule for payment appropriations will depend on Member States decisions as regards the prolongation of the current rural development programmes. Similarly, any decision of Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development will be neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments but may have an impact in terms of timing of payments that however cannot be estimated."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 on comitology sets out the mechanism for the control of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers by Member States. Under the most frequently used procedure, the so-called “examination procedure”, the Commission representatives submit draft implementing acts to a committee composed of representatives from the Member States, which gives its opinion, generally by vote. The appeal committee was introduced in Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 in order to elevate the debate, in particular in case the examination committee did not deliver an opinion, to a more political level. The Commission has found itself in the past years in a situation where it is legally obliged to take an authorisation decision in the absence of a qualified majority of the Member States taking position (either in favour or against) in the committee. This 'no opinion' situation is in the Commission's view particularly problematic when it concerns politically sensitive matters of direct impact on citizens and businesses, for instance in the field of health and safety of humans, animals or plants (e.g. GMOs or glyphosate). The Commission considered that Member States should, in these specific situations, also assume their responsibilities in the decision-making process to a greater extent. It is for this reason that it has proposed amendments to improve the functioning of the comitology procedures at the level of the appeal committee in order to ensure wider political accountability and ownership of politically sensitive implementing acts. CONTENT: this proposal provides for targeted and limited amendments to Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 and thus relates to implementing acts only. The Commission proposes to: amend the voting rules for the appeal committee in order to reduce the risk of a no opinion scenario and to clarify the positions of the Member States. To this end, the proposal stipulates that only Member States which are present or represented, and which do not abstain, should be considered as participating Member States for the calculation of the qualified majority. In order to ensure that the voting outcome is representative a vote should only be considered valid if a simple majority of the Member States are participating members of the appeal committee; provide the possibility of a further referral to the appeal committee at ministerial level where no opinion is delivered. The changes proposed aim at reducing the risk of no opinion outcomes at the appeal committee level and at facilitating the decision-making and to ensure the political ownership of Member States of certain sensitive decisions; increase the transparency of the comitology procedure by proposing that the votes of the Member States' representatives taken in the appeal committee be made public (they are currently confidential); enable the Commission to formally refer specific cases after a no opinion outcome in the appeal committee for a non-binding opinion to the Council, with a view to obtaining its political orientation on the implications of the no opinion outcome."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Bonn Agreement aims to combat pollution in the North Sea Area and safeguard coastal areas from maritime disasters and chronic pollution from ships and offshore installations. The European Union is a Contracting Party to the Agreement. Amendments were made to the agreement in 1989. These amendments entered into force on 1 April 1994. On 7 October 2019, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an amendment to extend the scope of the Bonn Agreement with a view to improving cooperation on surveillance with regard to the requirements of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the ""MARPOL Convention"") and the extension to the Kingdom of Spain under Article 20 of the Agreement. The amendments are now submitted for conclusion by the Union. CONTENT: the proposed Decision provides that the Council authorises the Commission to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the envisaged amendments to the Bonn Agreement relating to the extension of the material scope of the Agreement as regards Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention and the accession of the Kingdom of Spain to the Agreement. The amendments envisaged are the following: The ‘MARPOL amendment’ – amending the substantive scope of the Agreement This amendment seeks to improve cooperation and coordination between the Contracting Parties in combating unlawful air emissions caused by shipping in order to limit the negative consequences of the combustion of marine fuels with high sulphur or nitrogen content for human health, biodiversity and the entire marine environment. The adoption of the decision to conclude the amendment on the extension of the mandate of the Bonn Agreement in relation to Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention would improve joint surveillance, monitoring and reporting of ship emissions in the North Sea area. The ‘Spain amendment’ – amending the geographical scope of the Agreement This amendment extends the geographical scope of the Agreement to cover the area between the zone of joint responsibility of France and the United Kingdom and the new zone of responsibility of Spain in order to close any gaps between the old boundary of the Bonn Agreement and the new zone of responsibility of Spain. France has accepted the introduction of a new zone of responsibility of France."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons has been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 91/477/EEC. The proposed new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive lays down minimum provisions on the movement of firearms in the EU as defined in Annex I (Category A - Prohibited firearms; Category B - Firearms subject to authorisation and Category C - Firearms and other weapons subject to declaration). The Directive shall be without prejudice to the application of national provisions concerning the carrying of weapons, hunting or sporting shooting, where the weapons are legally acquired and held in accordance with the Directive. It shall not apply to the acquisition or possession, in accordance with national law, of arms and ammunition by armed forces, police or public authorities. The Directive shall not affect the power of Member States to take measures to prevent illegal arms trafficking. Member States could adopt stricter provisions in their legislation than those provided for in the Directive. Marking and registration All firearms manufactured in or imported into the Union on or after 14 September 2018 should be clearly, permanently marked and registered without delay after manufacture and, at the latest, before being placed on the market, or without delay after import into the Union. Member States shall: - establish a system including at least: (a) the registration of dealers and brokers operating in the territory of that Member State; (b) the requirement for dealers and brokers to be licensed or authorised in the territory of that Member State; and (c) a check on the professional and private good repute and relevant competence of the dealer or broker concerned; - establish a computerised data file, whether centralised or decentralised, guaranteeing access by the authorised authorities to the data-filing systems in which each firearm covered by the Directive is registered; - ensure that data relating to firearms, including the relevant personal data, are kept by the competent authorities in the data files for a period of 30 years after the destruction of the firearms or essential components in question. Traceability The Directive requires dealers and brokers to keep a record of all entries and exits they make with respect to each firearm, as well as data to enable the identification and tracing of the firearm. Gunsmiths and brokers established on their territory should report firearms transactions to the competent national authorities without undue delay. Acquisition and possession Member States shall permit the acquisition and possession of firearms only by persons who have good cause and who: - are at least 18 years of age, except in relation to the acquisition, other than through purchase, and possession of firearms for hunting and target shooting, provided that in that case persons of less than 18 years of age have parental permission, or are under parental guidance or the guidance of an adult with a valid firearms or hunting licence, or are within a licensed or otherwise approved training centre; - are not likely to be a danger to themselves or others, to public order or to public safety; the fact of having been convicted of a violent intentional crime shall be considered as indicative of such danger. Member States shall: - have in place a monitoring system, which operates continuously or periodically, to ensure that the conditions for the granting of an authorisation laid down by national law are fulfilled for the entire duration of the authorisation ; - lay down rules on the proper monitoring of firearms and ammunition and rules on their proper storage under safe conditions. Member States may take all appropriate measures to prohibit the acquisition and possession of category A firearms, essential components and ammunition. They may grant category A authorisations to marksmen and sportsmen, as well as to recognised museums and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, to collectors, subject to strict security measures. Authorisations to possess firearms shall be subject to periodic review at intervals of not more than five years. Deactivation of firearms The risk of acoustic weapons and other types of blank-firing weapons being converted into real firearms is high. Therefore, they shall be included within the scope of Directive. Taking into consideration the high risk of reactivating improperly deactivated firearms, the Directive requires the classification of deactivated firearms under category C (firearms subject to declaration). The deactivation of firearms shall be verified by a competent authority to ensure that modifications made to a firearm render all its essential components permanently inoperable and incapable of being reactived. The Commission shall establish standards and techniques to ensure that all essential components of a firearm are rendered permanently inoperable. Semi-automatic firearms Some dangerous semi-automatic firearms have now been added to category A and are therefore prohibited for civilian use. This is the case for: - short semi-automatic firearms with loading devices over 20 rounds; - long semi-automatic firearms with loading devices over 10 rounds; - semi-automatic long firearms that can be reduced to a length of less than 60 cm without losing functionality by means of a folding or telescoping stock or by a stock that can be removed without using tools. European firearms pass The European firearms pass is a document issued by the competent authorities of a Member State, upon request, to a person who becomes lawfully the holder and user of a firearm. Its maximum period of validity is five years, with the possibility of extension. The European firearms pass would be regarded as the main document required of target shooters and other persons authorised in accordance with this Directive to possess a firearm during a journey to another Member State."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the decline in passenger demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, air carriers have made major changes to their schedules since 1 March 2020, which have resulted in a slot utilisation rate at coordinated airports falling far below the 80% threshold imposed by the Slot Regulation. This situation is likely to continue to negatively impact air carriers up to and including winter 2024/2025. For the period starting after more than a year of waiving the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule (from 1 February 2020 to 27 March 2021), which preserves air carriers’ 2019 grandfathered slots until the end of the winter 2021/2022 scheduling season, the Commission proposes to establish a pathway to return to a normal application of the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule. The return to normal should not be sudden to avoid destabilising the aviation market to the detriment of air carriers, connectivity, EU consumers, and the environment. It should take place in line with future increases in traffic levels toward 2019 levels or by a stabilisation of air traffic to a new market situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that from the start of the summer 2021 scheduling period, the normal application of the slot utilisation requirements of the Slot Regulation should reapply, but that the rate should be set at 40/60 % instead of 80/20 %. Relief should be targeted at air carriers whose intention is to operate their grandfathered slots as soon as demand sufficiently recovers and flights are once again economically viable. Consequently, slot series newly allocated to an air carrier for the first time would not be covered by the planned relief. The proposal foresees a deadline for air carriers to return unwanted slots to the coordinator if they want to benefit from the relief. A deadline of three weeks before the planned operational date for that slot would give airports and other airport service providers visibility on the required capacity and the volume of operations that they are expected to make available adequate infrastructure, facilities and staff.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the decline in passenger demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, air carriers have made major changes to their schedules since 1 March 2020, which have resulted in a slot utilisation rate at coordinated airports falling far below the 80% threshold imposed by the Slot Regulation. This situation is likely to continue to negatively impact air carriers up to and including winter 2024/2025. For the period starting after more than a year of waiving the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule (from 1 February 2020 to 27 March 2021), which preserves air carriers’ 2019 grandfathered slots until the end of the winter 2021/2022 scheduling season, the Commission proposes to establish a pathway to return to a normal application of the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule. The return to normal should not be sudden to avoid destabilising the aviation market to the detriment of air carriers, connectivity, EU consumers, and the environment. It should take place in line with future increases in traffic levels toward 2019 levels or by a stabilisation of air traffic to a new market situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that from the start of the summer 2021 scheduling period, the normal application of the slot utilisation requirements of the Slot Regulation should reapply, but that the rate should be set at 40/60 % instead of 80/20 %. Relief should be targeted at air carriers whose intention is to operate their grandfathered slots as soon as demand sufficiently recovers and flights are once again economically viable. Consequently, slot series newly allocated to an air carrier for the first time would not be covered by the planned relief. The proposal foresees a deadline for air carriers to return unwanted slots to the coordinator if they want to benefit from the relief. A deadline of three weeks before the planned operational date for that slot would give airports and other airport service providers visibility on the required capacity and the volume of operations that they are expected to make available adequate infrastructure, facilities and staff. The proposal also clarifies under what circumstances coordinators could withdraw slots from air carriers. The Commission could adopt delegated acts to further extend the period during which the relief applies if the COVID-19 pandemic is not resolved and continues to have a negative impact on the air transport sector, including on historical grandfather rights."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extended for a period of 6 months (or 7 months in some cases) the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and postponed the completion of certain periodic checks and continuing training which, under the relevant EU legislation, should have taken place during the period between 1 March 2020 (or 1 February 2020 in some cases) and 31 August 2020. Some Member States have submitted reasoned requests to the Commission for authorisation to extend certain periods again. The Commission has adopted six decisions authorising such extensions. Despite some improvements in the situation during the summer of 2020, the persistence of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020 forced Member States to maintain or even reinforce the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As a consequence, transport operators may not be able to complete the formalities or procedures necessary to comply with certain provisions of EU law on the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or approvals, or on the completion of periodic checks and continuous training, or to take other necessary steps to maintain their validity, as was the case in spring 2020. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to adopt measures to remedy these problems and to ensure both legal certainty and the proper functioning of the legal acts concerned. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and to the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in response to the exceptional situation arising from the spread of COVID-19 in the fields of road, rail and inland waterway transport and maritime security during reference periods subsequent to those referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The proposal provides for adaptations, in particular for certain time limits, as well as the possibility for the Commission to authorise extensions on the basis of a request submitted by any Member State by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Such extensions should be limited to what is necessary in view of the period during which the completion of formalities, procedures, checks and training are likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, should not exceed six months. The proposal concerns specific provisions which affect the application of several directives and regulations concerning in particular: - the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers for driving licences; - tachographs in road transport; - the periodic technical inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers; - the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; - access to the international road haulage market and access to the international market for coach and bus services; - railway safety, the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union and the rules establishing a single European railway area; - the conditions for obtaining boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the Union, technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and the improvement of ship and port facility security. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency so that the situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors are minimised."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 changed the economic outlook for the years to come in the Union and in the world, calling for an urgent and coordinated response from the Union in order to cope with the enormous economic and social consequences for all Member States. The challenges linked to the demographic context have been amplified by COVID-19. Reforms and investments to address structural weaknesses of the economies and to strengthen their resilience are therefore essential to set the economies back on a sustainable recovery path and avoid further widening of the divergences in the Union. In this context, as a complement to the REACT-EU initiative, the Commission proposes to strengthen the current framework for support to Member States and to provide direct financial support to Member States through an innovative tool to underpin long-term reforms and investments - notably in green and digital technologies - that will have a lasting effect on the productivity and resilience of the Union's economy. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation establishes the ‘Recovery and Resilience Facility’. The scope of the instrument covers a wide range of policy areas, including areas related to cohesion, the dual transition (green and digital), competitiveness, productivity, health and smart innovation. Purpose The objective of the Facility is to promote the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union by (i) improving the resilience and adjustment capacity of Member States, (ii) mitigating the social and economic consequences of the crisis, and (iii) supporting the green and digital transitions towards a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. It shall thus contribute to restoring the growth potential of Member States' economies in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis, encourage job creation and foster sustainable growth. To this end, the Facility shall provide Member States with direct financial support to reach milestones and targets for reforms and investments. Recovery and resilience plans To benefit from the Facility, Member States shall prepare recovery and resilience plans setting out their reform and investment programmes for the next four years, i.e. until 2024. These plans shall include reforms and public investment projects to be implemented through a coherent package. The plans shall be consistent with the challenges and priorities identified in (i) the European Semester framework, (ii) the National Reform Programmes, (iii) the National Energy and Climate Plans, (iv) the Just Transition Plans and (v) the Partnership Agreements and Operational Programmes adopted under EU funds. Member States shall submit their plans to the Commission by 30 April each year at the latest, but they may submit a first draft together with their draft national budget in October. The plans may form an annex to the relevant national reform programme. The Facility shall: - identify reforms and investments to address the challenges identified in the context of the European Semester and explain, inter alia, how they enhance the growth potential and economic and social resilience of the Member State concerned and contribute to greater cohesion; - include measures relevant to the green and digital transitions; - set out estimated total costs and appropriate milestones, targets and an indicative timetable for the implementation of the reforms and of the investments. Provided that the evaluation criteria are satisfactorily met, the Commission shall adopt a decision fixing the financial contribution to be received by the Member State (grant and, where appropriate, loan), as well as the milestones and targets. For the purposes of informing the preparation and the implementation of the recovery and resilience plans by Member States, the Council may discuss in the context of the European Semester the state of recovery, resilience and adjustment capacity in the Union on the basis of the Commission’s strategic and analytical information available. The recovery and resilience plans adopted by the Commission shall be communicated to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission shall also report annually to both institutions on the progress made in the implementation of the plans by Member States and on expenditure under the Facility. Budgetary implications The financial envelope for the implementation of the facility shall be EUR 602 905 000 000 (in current prices). The envelope shall be financed from the borrowing operations of the Union. The bulk of the funding shall be provided in the form of grants, with possible supplements through loans. The total amount of grants available shall amount to EUR 334.950 million, while a further EUR 267.955 million shall be available in the form of loans. As far as grants are concerned, a maximum amount per Member State shall be determined on the basis of a predefined allocation key taking into account population, GDP per capita and unemployment. Member States may also apply for a loan for the implementation of their public reforms and investments. The maximum volume of loans for each Member State shall not exceed 4.7% of its gross national income. Given the temporary nature of the financing scheme of the Facility in relation to Member States’ economic recovery, the availability period of these resources is limited to 31 December 2024 for both the non-repayable financial support and for the loan support. As regards the non-repayable financial support, for at least 60 % of the total resources the necessary legal commitments should be entered into by 31 December 2022."

Following the addition of the United Kingdom on that list, the imports of seeds from the United Kingdom into the Union, as well as the maintenance of the respective varities in that country, should be allowed."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: while investment conditions in Europe have improved since the launch of the Juncker plan in 2014, thanks to a more favourable economic situation and government interventions such as the European Strategic Investment Fund (EFSI), there is still a significant investment gap in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic is a major shock to the world and EU economies. The contraction of EU GDP in 2020 - forecast at around 7.5% - is expected to be much deeper than during the 2009 financial crisis. For the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027, the Commission therefore considers it necessary to propose a reinforced EU investment programme to provide crucial support to businesses and to ensure a strong focus of private investors on the Union's medium and long-term priorities, including the Green Deal for Europe and digital transitions, as well as increased resilience. This is why the Commission is withdrawing its May 2018 proposal for the InvestEU programme and submitting a new proposal that takes full account of the partial agreement reached in April 2019 between the Parliament and the Council. This new proposal (i) increases the amount of the initially proposed financial envelope (ii) amends the scope of the proposal to reflect on the post-pandemic needs of the European economy. It builds on the lessons learned from the EFSI evaluations and previous financial instruments (Connecting Europe Facility, Horizon 2020, COSME, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme etc.). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to create the InvestEU programme for the multi-annual financial framework 2021-2027 in order to bring together under a single structure all financing from the EU budget in the form of loans and guarantees. The InvestEU programme shall be based on the following elements: The InvestEU Fund The InvestEU Fund shall mobilise public and private investment through a EU budget guarantee of EUR 75 153 850 000 (in current prices) which aims to support the investment projects of implementing partners. The Commission proposes that the guarantee be provisioned at 45%, which means that EUR 33 800 000 000 from the EU budget shall be set aside in case calls are made on the guarantee. The European Investment Bank (EIB) Group shall remain a privileged implementing partner for the Invest EU. It shall implement 75% of the EU guarantee. National development banks or institutions may also become implementing partners. Five policy windows The InvestEU Fund shall operate through 5 policy windows, each of which is aimed at addressing market failures or investment shortfalls within their specific scope: 1. sustainable infrastructure; 2. research, innovation and digitisation; 3. SMEs; 4. social investment and skills; 5. strategic European investments. In addition to increasing the resources of the sustainable infrastructure window, the Commission proposes to broaden the scope of the programme by adding a fifth strand - strategic European investment - with a view to meeting the future needs of the European economy and promoting and ensuring the strategic autonomy of the Union in key sectors. This window shall be endowed with an amount of up to EUR 31 153 850 000. This new window shall support final recipients established in a Member State and carrying out an activity of strategic importance to the Union, in particular with a view to green and digital transitions and increased resilience in areas such as: - provision of critical health care, manufacturing and stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and medical supplies, strengthening the capacity to respond to health crises; - critical infrastructure (e.g. energy, transport, environment, health, 5G, Internet of Things); - key enabling, transformative, green and digital technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence, block chains, renewable energy technologies, biomedicine). The InvestEU Advisory Hub The advisory hub would provide technical support and assistance in the preparation, development, structuring and implementation of projects, including capacity-building. The EIB Group would play a central role in the implementation of advisory support under the Hub. A financial envelope of EUR 724 733 000 (in current prices) is foreseen for the InvestEU Advisory Hub. The InvestEU Portal The InvestEU Portal shall be established to provide for an easily accessible and user-friendly project database to promote visibility of investment projects searching for financing with enhanced focus on the provision of a possible pipeline of investment projects, compatible with Union law and policies. Governance An investment committee of independent experts shall remain responsible for approving individual requests. The Commission performs a policy check on proposed financing or investment operations to verify that they are compliant with EU law before a proposal is submitted to the Investment Committee. Budgetary implications For the period 2021-2027, the budgetary framework (commitments at current prices) foreseen for the InvestEU programme amounts to EUR 33 524 733 000. The overall provisioning will amount to EUR 33 800 million, of which EUR 1 billion will be covered by revenues, repayments and recoveries generated by existing financial instruments and the EFSI."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an effective control system is essential to ensure that EU fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner, which in turn ensures the long-term viability of the EU fisheries sector and protects the livelihoods of EU fishermen. The measures establishing a Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) for ensuring compliance with rules of the CFP are provided for in four different legal acts: 1) the Fisheries Control Regulation; 2) the Regulation establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA); 3) the Regulation establishing a system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU Regulation); and 4) the Regulation on the sustainable management of the external fishing fleets (SMEF). With the exception of the SMEF regulation, which was recently revised, the current Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) was designed prior to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and as such it is not fully coherent with it. In addition, the system reflects control strategies, methodologies and challenges of more than 10 years ago, and it is not equipped to effectively address current and future needs in terms of fisheries data and fleet control, to match the constant evolution of fishing practices and techniques and to take advantage of modern and more cost-effective control technologies and data exchange systems. The current system also does not reflect new and modern Union policies recently adopted, such as the plastic strategy, the digital single market strategy, and the international ocean governance. Several discussions and exchanges of view have taken place in the Council, in the Parliament, in the Administrative Board of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with Member States and with stakeholders since the publication of all these documents. Those discussions confirmed that there is unanimous agreement among the European Institutions and among direct stakeholders that the Fisheries Control System is not effective and efficient and that, as such, it is not entirely fit for purpose to sustain the achievements of the CFP objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option selected is targeted changes to the fisheries control system (in particular regulations on fisheries control, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the European Fisheries Control Agency). Positive environmental impacts of the preferred option would encompass: reduction of overfishing, elimination of discards at sea, healthier fish stocks and proper control of marine protected areas. Main socio-economic benefits include: increased wages and competitiveness of fishing industry, especially for the small fleet; promotion of job creation (especially in ICT); improved compliance with the CFP and equal treatment of fishers. CONTENT: the specific objectives of the proposed revision of the fisheries control regime are to: bridge the gaps with the CFP and with other EU policies; simplify the legislative framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burden; improve availability, reliability and completeness of fisheries data and information, in particular of catch data, and allow exchange and sharing of information; remove obstacles that hinder the development of a culture of compliance and the equitable treatment of operators within and across Member States. The proposal contains, inter alia, the following measures: clarification of the inspection process , inspectors' duties, and masters' and operators' duties during inspections. Digitisation of inspection reports through the mandatory use of an Electronic Inspection Report System which will allow a better use and exchange of data between relevant authorities and Member States; a new list of infringements of the CFP rules, which should be qualified as serious by nature, new detailed and exhaustive list of criteria to qualify as serious certain other infringements of the CFP rules; a more reliable and complete fisheries data system providing for the full digitisation of transhipment and landing declarations, applicable to all EU fishing vessels (including those less than 12 metres in length), an electronic traceability system for all vessels, new weighing procedures for fishery products and strengthened rules for recording recreational catches; better traceability of EU and imported fishery and aquaculture products : traceability information is clarified so that it allows linking a specific lot of fishery products to a particular landing by an EU fishing vessel. Information is recorded electronically so that controls in the supply chain within the internal market are more effective and efficient; the use of remote electronic monitoring tools , in particular CCTVs, for the control of the landing obligation. Certain vessels with active fishing gears shall be fitted with a device that monitors and records engine power; improving the reporting of lost fishing gear through the use of (electronic) logbooks for all categories of vessels, the deletion of the current derogation for vessels under 12 metres to take on board the equipment necessary to recover lost gear and laying down conditions to establish EU provisions for the marking and control of fishing gear for recreational fisheries; the revision of the mandate of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to fully align its objectives with the Common Fisheries Policy and extend its inspection powers."

Parliament gave its consent to the draft Council regulation. The Regulation laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources (IMSOR) is part of the legislative package presented by the Commission in May 2018. The IMSOR as submitted in 2018 included provisions of a general and technical nature that are applicable to all categories of own resources and that would benefit from a better involvement of the European Parliament in the legislative procedure. The Council made substantial changes on the Commission proposal. The provisions to be taken up in the IMSOR are listed in Article 10 of the Own Resources Decision as adopted by the Council December 2020. In particular, Article 10 no longer includes any provisions pertaining to new own resources based on the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) because these categories of own resources were not taken up in the Council Decision of December 2020. Moreover, the Council did not retain in the IMSOR any provisions related to the determination of the ‘applicable call rates’. These are now to be determined entirely in the own resources decision itself. The draft Council Regulation as referred to the European Parliament contains provisions on the definition and calculation of the annual balance (usually a surplus) as well as control, supervision and reporting requirements for national authorities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. To ensure a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement, the Council adopted, on 13 October 2020, Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Member States have launched or plan to launch initiatives to issue vaccination certificates. However, for these to be used effectively in a cross-border context when citizens exercise their free movement rights, such certificates need to be fully interoperable, secure and verifiable. A commonly agreed approach is required among Member States on the content, format, principles and technical standards of such certificates. In their declaration adopted following the informal video conferences on 25-26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for further work on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission is working with Member States in the e-Health network, a voluntary network of national e-Health authorities, to prepare for the interoperability of these certificates. Work is also underway to develop a common harmonised data set for COVID-19 test result certificates. CONTENT: based on the technical work done so far, the proposed Regulation establishes the digital green certificate, which is a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital green certificate The interoperable digital green certificate should allow for the issuance, cross-border verification and acceptance of any of the following certificates: (i) vaccination certificates, (ii) certificates for screening tests (NAAT/RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) and (iii) certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Member States should issue the certificates in a digital and/or paper-based format. Certificates issued by Member States should contain an interoperable barcode to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The certificates should be available free of charge and in the official language(s) of the issuing Member State as well as in English. Trust framework The Commission and the Member States should establish a digital trust framework infrastructure allowing for the secure issuance and verification of certificates and ensuring, as far as possible, interoperability with internationally established technology systems. The proposal also provides for the acceptance of secure and verifiable certificates issued by third countries to EU citizens and their family members according to an international standard that is interoperable with the trust framework established by the Regulation and that will contain the necessary personal data, following an implementing decision by the Commission. Issuance, content and acceptance of certificates The proposal provides details on the issuance, content and acceptance of the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certificate of recovery. The certificates would include a limited set of essential information such as name, date of birth, date of issue, relevant information on the vaccine administered/tested/recovery and a unique certificate identifier. The digital green certificate would be valid in all EU Member States and open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The possession of a ‘digital green certificate’, in particular a vaccination certificate, should not be a precondition for the exercise of free movement. In particular, the proposed Regulation cannot be interpreted as establishing an obligation or right to be vaccinated. Notification The proposal establishes a notification procedure to ensure that the other Member States and the Commission are informed of the restrictions on the right to free movement made necessary by the pandemic. Data protection The certificates should contain only such personal data as is necessary. Given that the personal data includes sensitive medical data, a very high level of data protection should be ensured and data minimisation principles should be preserved. In particular, the ‘Digital Green Certificate’ framework should not require the setting up and maintenance of a database at EU level but should allow for the decentralised verification of digitally signed interoperable certificates. Temporary measure The proposal foresees that the measures should be suspended once the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third-country nationals who are legally resident or staying in a Member State can move freely within the territory of the other Member States, provided they fulfil certain conditions. However, in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. Following the Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the technical work carried out in the Health Security Committee and the e-Health network, the Commission has put forward (in parallel with this proposal) a proposal for a Digital Green Certificate Regulation to establish an EU-wide framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The framework set out in the proposal for a Regulation on a digital green certificate applies to Union citizens or their family members who may be a third country national. This proposal has the objective of ensuring that the same framework applies to other third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing on the territory of an EU Member State and who are entitled to travel to another Member State in accordance with Union law. CONTENT: the proposal aims to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates of COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery. In concrete terms, the interoperable green digital certificate will prove that a person has been vaccinated against, tested negative for or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available free of charge, either electronically or paper format, and will include a QR code to ensure its security and authenticity. Member States should apply the rules set out in the future Regulation on a digital green certificate to third-country nationals who do not fall within the scope of that Regulation but who are legally resident or staying in their territory and are authorised to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. This proposal establishes neither an obligation nor a right to vaccination. Vaccination strategies are a national competence of the Member States. The proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The digital green certificate would thus be open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."

As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas. The aim is to maintain the full existing volume of each tariff quota in the future, but to divide it between two separate customs territories: the EU-27 and the UK. The principle behind the applied methodology is based on trade flows to the EU-27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. The negotiations with Norway resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 7-8 July 2020."

The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. The EU published its Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan in 2003. The plan aims to combat illegal logging around the world. By entering Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with timber producing third countries, the EU opens for imports of legally sourced timber and timber products to enter the Single Market. These agreements are binding trade agreements. They also contribute to better regulation and governance of the forest sector in the exporting country. Honduras was the first Latin American country to initiate and successfully conclude negotiations for a VPA with the EU. These negotiations started in 2013 and were completed in 2018. Honduras is also the first VPA partner that has included indigenous peoples as a separate interest group at the negotiating table. For the EU, this agreement is in line with its objectives under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the Aichi Targets of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030. Within these frameworks, it is committed to, inter alia, encouraging sustainable forest management, combating deforestation and forest degradation and promoting sustainable development. The Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the EU and Honduras: - establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the timber legality assurance system for the FLEGT licensing scheme; - sets out the framework for monitoring compliance and for independent evaluation of the system; - includes a clear commitment by Honduras to develop legislation to ensure that timber imported in Honduras has been legally harvested in compliance with the applicable legislation in the country of harvest; - establishes a mechanism for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Honduras on the FLEGT licensing scheme, via a Joint Implementation Committee; - establishes principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards, accountability and transparency, and mechanisms for complaints on, monitoring of and reporting on implementation of the Agreement. The Agreement makes provision for import controls at the EU’s borders, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 on the FLEGT licensing scheme and Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008 laying down detailed measures for implementing it."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 30 January 2020, following the approval of the European Parliament, the Council adopted Decision (EU) 2020/135 on the conclusion of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The withdrawal agreement entered into force on 1 February 2020 and provides for a transitional period during which Union law applies to the United Kingdom and on its territory in accordance with the agreement. This period will end on 31 December 2020. On 25 February 2020, the Council adopted Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/266 authorising the opening of negotiations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on a new partnership agreement. The Commission was appointed as the Union's negotiator. On 24 December 2020, negotiations were concluded and the Parties agreed on the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and on the Agreement on security procedures for the exchange of classified information and its protection. CONTENT: the draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Security of Information Agreement fully respect the Treaties and preserve the integrity and the autonomy of the Union legal order. These agreements will not require the EU to amend its rules, regulations or standards in any regulated area. They promote the values, objectives, and interests of the Union, and ensure the consistency, effectiveness and continuity of its policies and actions. The envisaged partnership is based on the recognition of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, as well as the fight against climate change and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Failure to comply with any of these essential elements shall entitle the Parties to terminate or suspend the application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement or any supplementary agreement, in whole or in part. The Parties also affirm their willingness to ensure a high level of protection of personal data. The draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement consists of three main pillars: Comprehensive and balanced free trade agreement The draft agreement: - covers not just trade in goods and services, but also a broad range of other areas in the EU's interest, such as investment, competition, State aid, tax transparency, air and road transport, energy and sustainability, fisheries, data protection, and social security coordination; - provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin; - ensures a strong level playing field: all imports from the UK should comply with EU rules and regulations (e.g. technical rules and product standards, sanitary and phytosanitary rules, food and safety regulations, health and safety standards, environmental and consumer protection rules); - establishes a new framework for the joint management of fish stocks in their respective waters; - ensures a number of rights of EU citizens and UK nationals. This concerns EU citizens working in, travelling or moving to the UK and to UK nationals working in, travelling or moving to the EU after 1st January 2021; - enables the UK's continued participation in a number of flagship EU programmes for the period 2021-2027 (subject to a financial contribution by the UK to the EU budget), such as Horizon Europe. A new partnership for security The draft agreement establishes a framework for law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It recognises the need for close cooperation between national law enforcement and judicial authorities and EU agencies and bodies, in particular as regards the fight against and prosecution of cross-border crime and terrorism. It respects the status of the United Kingdom as a non-member of the EU outside the Schengen area. Police and judicial cooperation is based on guarantees of respect for democracy and the rule of law, and effective protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, including those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. There are specific provisions on the suspension of cooperation in the event of serious and systemic failures in the implementation of any of these safeguards, as well as a specific dispute settlement mechanism. A horizontal agreement on governance The governance provisions clarify how the Trade and Cooperation Agreement should be implemented and monitored. The Agreement provides for the possibility for the Parties to take swift, autonomous and operational measures to protect their interests, in particular in the areas of the level playing field (i.e. rebalancing measures, remedial measures) and fisheries (i.e. compensatory measures, remedial measures), as well as, more generally, in cases of serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties of a sectorial or regional nature. The Partnership Council, composed of representatives of the Union and the United Kingdom at ministerial level, should monitor the implementation of the agreement. Security for the exchange of information The draft supplementary agreement on security procedures for the exchange of classified information and its protection sets out rules and modalities for the exchange of classified and unclassified sensitive information. It guarantees the secure treatment of sensitive information, based on the principle of the originator’s consent prior to the release of the information exchanged."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to limit the spread of the virus, Member States have adopted various measures, some of which have had an impact on travel to and within the territory of the Member States, such as the requirement to undergo quarantine or self-containment or to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to and/or after arrival. To ensure a well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to the adoption of restrictions on freedom of movement, the Council adopted, on 13 October 2020, Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Member States have launched or plan to launch initiatives to issue vaccination certificates. However, for these to be used effectively in a cross-border context when citizens exercise their free movement rights, such certificates need to be fully interoperable, secure and verifiable. A commonly agreed approach is required among Member States on the content, format, principles and technical standards of such certificates. In their declaration adopted following the informal video conferences on 25-26 February 2021, the members of the European Council called for further work on a common approach to vaccination certificates. The Commission is working with Member States in the e-Health network, a voluntary network of national e-Health authorities, to prepare for the interoperability of these certificates. Work is also underway to develop a common harmonised data set for COVID-19 test result certificates. CONTENT: based on the technical work done so far, the proposed Regulation establishes the digital green certificate, which is a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Digital green certificate The interoperable digital green certificate should allow for the issuance, cross-border verification and acceptance of any of the following certificates: (i) vaccination certificates, (ii) certificates for screening tests (NAAT/RT-PCR or rapid antigen test) and (iii) certificates for persons who have recovered from COVID-19. Member States should issue the certificates in a digital and/or paper-based format. Certificates issued by Member States should contain an interoperable barcode to verify the authenticity, validity and integrity of the certificate. The certificates should be available free of charge and in the official language(s) of the issuing Member State as well as in English. Trust framework The Commission and the Member States should establish a digital trust framework infrastructure allowing for the secure issuance and verification of certificates and ensuring, as far as possible, interoperability with internationally established technology systems. The proposal also provides for the acceptance of secure and verifiable certificates issued by third countries to EU citizens and their family members according to an international standard that is interoperable with the trust framework established by the Regulation and that will contain the necessary personal data, following an implementing decision by the Commission. Issuance, content and acceptance of certificates The proposal provides details on the issuance, content and acceptance of the vaccination certificate, the test certificate and the certificate of recovery. The certificates would include a limited set of essential information such as name, date of birth, date of issue, relevant information on the vaccine administered/tested/recovery and a unique certificate identifier. The digital green certificate would be valid in all EU Member States and open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The possession of a ‘digital green certificate’, in particular a vaccination certificate, should not be a precondition for the exercise of free movement. In particular, the proposed Regulation cannot be interpreted as establishing an obligation or right to be vaccinated. Notification The proposal establishes a notification procedure to ensure that the other Member States and the Commission are informed of the restrictions on the right to free movement made necessary by the pandemic. Data protection The certificates should contain only such personal data as is necessary. Given that the personal data includes sensitive medical data, a very high level of data protection should be ensured and data minimisation principles should be preserved. In particular, the ‘Digital Green Certificate’ framework should not require the setting up and maintenance of a database at EU level but should allow for the decentralised verification of digitally signed interoperable certificates. Temporary measure The proposal foresees that the measures should be suspended once the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the end of the COVID-19 international health emergency."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third-country nationals who are legally resident or staying in a Member State can move freely within the territory of the other Member States, provided they fulfil certain conditions.

Following the Council Recommendation (EU) 2020/1475 on a coordinated approach to the restriction of free movement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the technical work carried out in the Health Security Committee and the e-Health network, the Commission has put forward (in parallel with this proposal) a proposal for a Digital Green Certificate Regulation to establish an EU-wide framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable health certificates to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This proposal has the objective of ensuring that the same framework applies to other third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing on the territory of an EU Member State and who are entitled to travel to another Member State in accordance with Union law. CONTENT: the proposal aims to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates of COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery. In concrete terms, the interoperable green digital certificate will prove that a person has been vaccinated against, tested negative for or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available free of charge, either electronically or paper format, and will include a QR code to ensure its security and authenticity. Member States should apply the rules set out in the future Regulation on a digital green certificate to third-country nationals who do not fall within the scope of that Regulation but who are legally resident or staying in their territory and are authorised to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. This proposal establishes neither an obligation nor a right to vaccination. Vaccination strategies are a national competence of the Member States. The proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The digital green certificate would thus be open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."

This proposal has the objective of ensuring that the same framework applies to other third-country nationals who are legally staying or legally residing on the territory of an EU Member State and who are entitled to travel to another Member State in accordance with Union law. CONTENT: the proposal aims to facilitate the movement of third-country nationals within the EU during the COVID-19 pandemic by establishing a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates of COVID-19 vaccination, testing and recovery. In concrete terms, the interoperable green digital certificate will prove that a person has been vaccinated against, tested negative for or recovered from COVID-19. It will be available free of charge, either electronically or paper format, and will include a QR code to ensure its security and authenticity. Member States should apply the rules set out in the future Regulation on a digital green certificate to third-country nationals who do not fall within the scope of that Regulation but who are legally resident or staying in their territory and are authorised to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. This proposal establishes neither an obligation nor a right to vaccination. Vaccination strategies are a national competence of the Member States. The proposed Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The digital green certificate would thus be open to Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation providing for the continuation of the Pericles programme in the post-2020 multiannual financial framework. Article 139 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures governing the use of the euro referred to in Article 133 thereof shall not apply to the Member States with derogation. However, the exchange of information and staff and the assistance and training measures implemented under the Pericles programme should be uniform throughout the Union. The Commission recalled the significant role of non-participating Member States under the current extension of the Pericles 2020 programme. The National bank of Croatia, for instance, organised a series of conferences under the title ‘Balkan network for euro protection’ gathering experts from South East Europe to reinforce the protection of the euro against counterfeiting in this area, known for its distribution and production of euro counterfeits. The Commission therefore considered it necessary to take the necessary measures to ensure the same level of protection for the euro in the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the Regulation establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles IV) to the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. Entities from those Member States shall be considered eligible for funding when they are competent authorities within the meaning of the programme."

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The basis of this approach is that the existing volume of each TRQ would be fully maintained in the future but split across two separate customs territories: the EU27 and the UK. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period for all WTO TRQs. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch GATT Article XXVIII negotiations with the WTO Members concerned with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO tariff quota concessions. The negotiations with Cuba resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 3 July 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway was negotiated by the Commission, as authorised by the Council on 21 December 2016. This Agreement is based on the Air Transport Agreement (ATA) between the EU and the United States, which was signed on 25 and 30 April 2007. The EU-US ATA is the most important air transport agreement in the world, providing more than 75 million seats per year, and as such a cornerstone of the EU’s external aviation policy. The ATA between the EU and the US foresees an open wet-lease regime between the parties. The negotiating directives set out the general objective of negotiating a Wet Lease Agreement with the aim of providing precision to the relevant provisions of the ATA and abolishing time limitations for wet lease arrangements affecting the EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to authorise, on behalf of the Union, the conclusion of the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland, and the Kingdom of Norway. The Wet Lease Agreement will resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the application of the wet lease provisions of the ATA, and as such contribute to the well-functioning of the transatlantic aviation relationship The Agreement confirms the establishment of clear and non-restrictive wet lease arrangements involving the airlines of the Parties, thereby providing more precision to the respective provisions of the ATA. The Wet Lease Agreement not only resolves the current dispute on the application of the relevant provisions of the ATA, it also provides clarity and legal certainty for future arrangements affecting EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers."

Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Aarhus Regulation) established provisions to apply the provisions of the Convention to EU institutions and bodies.

In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament reaffirmed that it is essential to ensure that EU citizens have genuine access to justice and documents as enshrined in the Aarhus Convention.

In concrete terms, the amending proposal: - extends the current possibilities for NGOs to request administrative review: whereas administrative review can currently only be requested for acts of 'individual scope' (which directly concern a person), in future NGOs may also request review of any non-legislative administrative act of 'general scope'; however, the proposal excludes provisions of such acts for which EU law explicitly requires implementing measures at EU or national level; - amends the references to environmental law by providing that, in future, any administrative act which contravenes EU environmental law may be subject to review, irrespective of its policy objectives; however, the proposal does not envisage granting standing for individuals; - extends the deadlines for the internal review procedure to allow for an appropriate quality of submissions, including a two-week extension for NGOs and a four-week extension for EU institutions. Budgetary implications The report and the external study on the functioning of access to justice in environmental matters accompanying the proposal assessed the impact of the different options on the internal resources of the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits for gaseous and particulate pollutants and EU type-approval procedures for various categories of engines for non-road mobile machinery. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Regulation (EU) 2020/1040 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 was adopted. The aim of this Regulation was to postpone certain deadlines that manufacturers could no longer meet without sustaining serious economic damage due to the unexpected disruptions in the supply chain. This concerned machinery that use so-called ‘transition engines’ in the power range <56kW and >130kW, and whose production had to be completed by 30 June 2020 and placing on the market by 31 December 2020. Under the amended Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, manufacturers were provided with an additional 12 months to produce and place on the market the machinery fitted with those engines. However, due to the continued supply chain and production disruptions caused by the COVID-19 second and third waves, manufacturers will not be able to meet the 2021 deadlines applicable to the machinery fitted with transition engines in the power range between 56kW and 130kW, and above 300kW without sustaining serious economic damage. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to postpone the deadlines to avoid that transition engines can no longer be fitted in the machinery in time and are then scrapped. CONTENT: in view of the current situation and to ensure legal certainty and to avoid possible market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for the construction and placing on the market of machinery equipped with certain transition engines. The extension of the relevant periods should be 6 months for the production of machinery equipped with these engines and 9 months for the placing on the market."

On 11 February 2021, the Conference of Presidents took the decision to authorise the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs to split the Commission proposal into two parts and to draw up two separate legislative reports on this basis. As a reminder, Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 of the European Parliament and of the Council established the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) for third-country nationals exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa when crossing external borders. It laid down the conditions and procedures for issuing or refusing a travel authorisation under that system. ETIAS enables consideration of whether the presence of those third-country nationals in the territory of the Member States would pose a security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk. In order to enable the processing of application files by the ETIAS Central System, the proposed amending regulation defines the modalities of interoperability between the ETIAS information system, other EU information systems and Europol data, as well as the conditions for the consultation of data stored in other EU information systems and Europol data should be implemented in the ETIAS automated processing for the purpose of identifying hits. Accordingly, this regulation amends Regulations (EU) 2019/816 and (EU) 2019/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council in order to connect the ETIAS Central System to the other EU information systems and to Europol data and to specify the data that will be sent to and from those EU information systems and Europol data. The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the proposal as follows: Subject matter of Regulation (EU) 2019/816 The amendments introduced clarify that Regulation (EU) 2019/816 establishes the conditions under which data contained in the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN) may be used by the ETIAS Central Unit in order to allow for a thorough assessment of the security risks posed by applicants before their arrival at external border crossing points. Entry of data in the ECRIS-TCN For each convicted third-country national, the central authority of the convicting Member State is required to create a data file in the Central System. This file should contain a flag indicating that the third-country national concerned has been convicted in the past 25 years of a terrorist offence or in the previous 15 years of any other criminal offence listed in the Annex to Regulation (EU) 2018/1240, where those criminal offences are punishable under national law by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a maximum period of at least three years, and in those cases the code of the convicting Member State(s). Flags and the code of the convicting Member State(s) should be accessible and searchable only by the Visa Information System (VIS) and the ETIAS system for verification purposes. Retention period of stored data The flags should be erased automatically upon the expiry of the retention period referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article or at the latest, 25 years after the creation of the flag, as far as convictions related to terrorist offences are concerned, and 15 years after the creation of the flag, as far as convictions related to other serious criminal offences are concerned Each ECRIS-TCN data processing operation in the Common Identity Records (CIR) and ETIAS should be recorded."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community, which has been amended several times and quite substantially. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bringing them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the following: Charges for cross-border payments in euro According to the proposal, charges levied by a payment service provider on a payment service user in respect of cross-border payments in euro shall be the same as the charges levied by that payment service provider for corresponding national payments of the same value in the national currency of the Member State in which the payment service provider of the payment service user is located. In order to facilitate the functioning of the Internal Market, the proposal lays down the principle that payment service providers shall align the charges they levy for cross-border payments in euro with the charges they levy for comparable national payments made in the national currency of the Member State in which they are established, including where the euro is not the national currency of that Member State. Transparency obligations The proposal sets out transparency requirements relating to currency conversion practices. It therefore provides that consumers shall be fully informed of the amount of exchange charges before making a cross-border payment (for example, when using their card abroad, be it a cash withdrawal from an ATM or to pay by card at the point of sale). To allow comparability, currency conversion charges for all card payments shall be expressed in the same way, namely as percentage mark-ups over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). These mark-ups shall be communicated to the payer prior to the initiation of the payment transaction. In order to facilitate the automation of payments, banks shall, where appropriate: (i) communicate to the user the user's International Payment Account Number Identifier (IBAN) and the bank's Business Identifier Code (BIC); (ii) indicate on the statement of accounts or in an annex to the statements, the user's IBAN and the bank's BIC. Compliance with obligations The proposal obliges Member States to provide for complaint procedures for alleged infringements of this Regulation, as well as effective out-of-court redress procedures for the settlement of disputes. Penalties may be imposed for infringements."

The legislative procedure to adopt the Statute of the European ombudsman is of special constitutional and institutional nature. On the one hand, Parliament has an authentic right of legislative initiative, the so-called direct right of initiative. On the other hand, consent of the Council is required and the Commission must give its opinion. Given the approval of the Council and the European Commission’s favourable opinion, Parliament adopted the regulation laying down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties. In concrete terms, the proposed regulation: - sets out the conditions under which a complaint can be made to the Ombudsman; - provides for procedures to be followed when the Ombudsman's enquiries reveal maladministration; - allow the Ombudsman, without prejudice to his or her primary duty, which is to handle complaints, to conduct own-initiative inquiries whenever he or she finds grounds, and in particular in repeated, systemic or particularly serious instances of maladministration; - provides for the possibility for the Ombudsman to conduct an enquiry to identify maladministration in the context of raising alerts. The Ombudsman should have access to all elements required for the performance of his or her duties. To that end, the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should provide the Ombudsman with any information that he or she requests for the purposes of an inquiry. The Ombudsman and his or her staff should be obliged to treat in confidence any information which they have acquired in the course of their duties, without prejudice to the Ombudsman's obligation to inform the authorities of the Member States of facts which might relate to criminal offences and have come to his or her attention in the course of an inquiry. The Ombudsman should also be able to inform the Union institution, body, office or agency concerned of the facts that call into question the conduct of a member of their staff. Where necessary for the effective performance of his or her duties, the Ombudsman should be given the possibility to cooperate and exchange information with the authorities of the Member States, in compliance with the applicable national and Union law, and with other Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, in particular those responsible for the defence and protection of fundamental rights. The draft regulation stipulates that the Ombudsman should be appointed by the European Parliament at the beginning of the parliamentary term and for the duration thereof, chosen from among persons who are citizens of the Union and who offer all requisite guarantees of independence and competence. General conditions should also be laid down inter alia concerning the cessation of the Ombudsman's duties, the replacement of the Ombudsman, incompatibilities, the remuneration of the Ombudsman and the privileges and immunities of the Ombudsman. The seat of the Ombudsman should be that of the European Parliament."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2017/2397 lays down transitional measures concerning the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued before 18 January 2022 (the day following the expiry of the period for the transposition of the Directive). In general, the documents concerned remain valid on the EU inland waterways for which they were valid before that date, for a maximum of 10 years. However, apart from the Rhine navigation licences referred to in Directive 96/50/EC, those transitional measures do not apply to the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries that are currently recognised by Member States under their national requirements established before the entry into force of the Directive or their international agreements. Consequently, from 17 January 2022, third country documents will be recognised in the EU only once the Commission has adopted an implementing act under the Directive granting recognition in the EU to the documents issued by that third country. Given that the procedure for recognition of third country documents is based on the assessment of the certification systems in the requesting third country, it is unlikely that the recognition procedure will be completed before 17 January 2022. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to introduce transitional provisions applicable to third country documents recognised in certain Member States before 18 January 2022, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the system of recognition of third country documents provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and to avoid any disruption of the labour market in the inland waterway transport sector. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States to continue to recognise third country documents based on their national requirements established before the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 (16 January 2018). The recognition should be limited to inland waterways situated in the territory of the Member State concerned and should not apply beyond 17 January 2032. The scope of this transitional measure could only cover documents issued by a third country before the cut-off date (18 January 2023). The proposed amendment clarifies that certificates of qualification issued by a third country in exchange for the certificates covered by the transitional arrangements should be valid on all inland EU waterways, provided that the third country concerned has obtained recognition in accordance with Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and that the requirements for the exchange applied by that third country have been found to be identical to those laid down in the Directive with regard to the Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 provides that the Union budget should continue to support fisheries and maritime affairs policies. Europe's maritime sector employs over 5 million jobs generating almost EUR 500 billion a year, with a potential to create many more jobs. The output of the global ocean economy is estimated at EUR 1.3 trillion and this could more than double by 2030. Fisheries are vital to the livelihood and cultural heritage of many coastal communities in the EU and an essential part of their cultural heritage. Along with aquaculture, it also contributes to food security and nutrition. EU support is a key tool for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of the sea's biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans, notably in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the European maritime and fisheries fund (EMFF) for the period 2021-2027. Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council shall be repealed. The new Fund shall support the environmental, economic, social and employment objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), promote the implementation of the Union's maritime policy and support the Union's international commitments in the field of ocean governance. The fund's support shall be based on four priorities: 1. Fostering sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources : support from the EMFF shall aim to achieve and maintain sustainable fishing based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and to minimise the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem with particular attention to small-scale fishermen. That support shall include innovation and investments in low-impact, climate resilient and low-carbon fishing practices and techniques. Support for fleet adaptation remains sometimes necessary with regard to certain fleet segments and sea basins. Such support should be tightly targeted to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and aimed to achieve balance between the fishing capacity and the available fishing opportunities. 2. Contributing to food security in the Union through competitive and sustainable aquaculture and markets : the EMFF may support the promotion and the sustainable development of aquaculture, including freshwater aquaculture, for the farming of aquatic animals and plants for the production of food and other raw material. Public health actions, aquaculture stock insurance schemes and animal health and welfare actions shall also be eligible. 3. Enabling the growth of a sustainable blue economy and fostering prosperous coastal communities : the fund shall support community-led local development under shared management to stimulate economic diversification in a local context through the development of coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture and a sustainable blue economy. It shall also support the collection, management and use of data to improve knowledge of the state of the marine environment. 4. Strengthening international ocean governance and enabling safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans : the EU plays a leading role in particular in preventing, deterring and eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, improving the international framework for ocean governance, reducing pressures on oceans and seas, creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy and strengthening international ocean research and data. The EMFF shall support these international commitments and objectives under direct management. The EMFF shall also contribute to achieving the Union's environmental objectives in the light of the Commission's proposal to increase the total share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25%. Simplification : under the proposal, the EMFF beyond 2020 shall evolve towards a simplified architecture. Its effectiveness shall be improved by (i) allowing Member States to target support based on their strategic priorities; (ii) better targeting of support for the CFP; and (iii) better alignment with other EU funds since the rules applicable to all structural and investment funds are laid down in a Common Provisions Regulation. In concrete terms, the EMFF shall co-finance projects alongside national funding streams with each Member State receiving a share of the total budget. Member States would prepare their national operational programmes indicating how they intend to spend the funds. Once these programmes have been approved by the Commission, the national authorities would decide which projects they wish to finance. Proposed budget : the proposed overall budget for the EMFF amounts, in current prices, to EUR 6.14 billion, of which (i) EUR 5.31 billion allocated to support under shared management by the Member States through EMFF programmes based on national strategies and (ii) EUR 829 million to direct management. Concerning shared management, after having deducted the value of the UK programme (EUR 243 million), Member States would retain, in nominal terms, 96.5% of their 2014-2020 allocation. In order to ensure stability in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, the definition of national allocations will be based on the 2014-2020 shares."

Parliament gave its consent to the draft Council decision. The Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) is an EU funding programme that finances research projects in the coal and steel sectors. The RFCS has its own legal bases standing outside the Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission proposal foresees amendments to the current Decision 2003/76/EC. It aims to allow for the sale of part of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation for the period 2021-2027 in order to provide an annual allocation to the RFCS of EUR 111 million to finance research in the coal and steel sectors, namely: - EUR 40 billion to fund collaborative research in these sectors and; - EUR 71 billion to fund research into breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism. The proposal does not create any new liabilities to be charged to the General Budget under the current multiannual financial framework (MFF). With the exception of some carry-over due to payment requests still to be satisfied within the annual allocation, the assets will stabilise after 2027 and will not be further reduced. In other words, based on the proposal the assets left intact after 2027 should still be intact in 2050, bar the (positive or negative) effect of the ECSC portfolio performance."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the report on the ‘European Environment - State and Outlook 2020’, presented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on 4 December 2019, identified the unprecedented scale and urgency of the environmental, climate and sustainability challenges facing Europe today. These challenges require immediate and concerted action and urgent systemic solutions. The European Commission has responded to these challenges by adopting the ‘European Green Deal’, which aims to make the EU the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Following the debate on the communication ‘A clean planet for all’, in March 2020 the EU presented its long-term strategy under the Paris agreement on climate change, committing the EU to becoming a climate-neutral economy by 2050. The Commission has proposed enshrining this target in EU climate law. In response to the coronavirus crisis, the ‘Next Generation EU recovery plan’ proposed by the European Commission on 27 May 2020 and endorsed by the Extraordinary European Council of July 2020 underlines the importance of the European Green Deal. As a follow-up to the Seventh Environment Action Programme (7th EAP) which shall expire on 31 December 2020, the Commission is presenting a proposal for an 8th EAP, with a long-term vision and priority environmental objectives to support the EU's common commitment to achieve a green recovery. CONTENT: the proposal for a decision establishes a general action programme in the field of the environment for the period up to 31 December 2030 to accelerate the Union's transition towards a climate-neutral, clean, resource-efficient and circular economy in a fair and inclusive manner. The 8th EAP shall support the environment and climate action objectives of the European Green Deal in line with the long-term objective to ‘live well, within the planetary boundaries’ by 2050, which is already established in the 7th EAP. It shall contribute to achieving the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Priority objectives The proposed 8th EAP sets thematic priority objectives in the areas of climate neutrality, adaptation to climate change, protection and restoration of biodiversity, aiming at zero pollution and reducing the pressures of production and consumption on the environment. It also sets out the conditions for achieving the long-term objectives and priority thematic objectives for all actors involved. Monitoring framework One of the key actions of the 8th EAP, announced by the European Green Deal, is a new monitoring framework to measure the progress made by the EU and its Member States in implementing the programme's priority objectives. The 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide the environment and climate input to the EU’s overall efforts to measure progress towards sustainability and shall inform policy makers and stakeholders if the Union and the Member States are on track to achieving a systemic transformation. The process to develop an 8th EAP monitoring framework shall provide an opportunity to explore the potential of the ongoing workstream on the planetary boundaries (e.g. freshwater use, land use change, ocean acidification) and on the Union consumption footprint, including deforestation and forest degradation in third countries. Key indicators The 8th EAP monitoring framework should comprise a limited number of key indicators for high-level communication, which tell a coherent story about the state of the environment, the main pressures and the effectiveness of our response. On the basis of a consultation process with the other EU institutions, Member States and stakeholders, the Commission intends to present a set of key indicators for the 8th EAP by the end of 2021. Budgetary implications This proposal has been developed in line with the Commission proposal for the EU Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. It introduces the need for additional resources in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and in the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in supporting the new monitoring, measuring and reporting framework of this Programme. The estimated impact on operational expenditure for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 23.379 million for the EEA and EUR 2.369 million for ECHA. It is expected that Heading 3 of the MFF ‘Natural Resources and Environment’ shall maintain neutrality and shall not be impacted by this proposal. The resources needed for the EEA and ECHA shall be deducted from the LIFE budget according to a split of 2/3 of the costs for DG Environment and 1/3 of the costs of DG Climate Action for the EEA, while the resources needed for ECHA shall be fully covered by DG Environment."

It introduces the need for additional resources in the European Environment Agency (EEA) and in the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in supporting the new monitoring, measuring and reporting framework of this Programme. The estimated impact on operational expenditure for the period 2021-2027 is estimated at EUR 23.379 million for the EEA and EUR 2.369 million for ECHA. It is expected that Heading 3 of the MFF ‘Natural Resources and Environment’ shall maintain neutrality and shall not be impacted by this proposal. The resources needed for the EEA and ECHA shall be deducted from the LIFE budget according to a split of 2/3 of the costs for DG Environment and 1/3 of the costs of DG Climate Action for the EEA, while the resources needed for ECHA shall be fully covered by DG Environment."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current health security framework, established by Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, provides a limited legal framework for EU level coordination, based essentially on a) an early warning system (EWRS) and the exchange of information and cooperation within the HSC. Early lessons learnt have shown that the current system has not allowed an optimal response at EU level to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structures and mechanisms under the Decision, while key in facilitating the exchange of information on the evolution of the pandemic and in supporting the adoption of national measures, could do little to trigger a timely common EU level response, co-ordinate the crucial aspects of risk communication, or ensure solidarity among Member States. The revision of the health security framework proposes a stronger and more comprehensive legal basis for the EU to prepare and respond to health crises. In addition, the proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to enhance the roles of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). CONTENT: the overarching aim of the proposed regulation is to provide a strengthened framework for health crisis preparedness and response at EU level by addressing the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it would: set out a comprehensive legislative framework to govern action at EU level on preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, and early warning and responses; and enhance the EU’s guidance in the adoption of common measures at EU level to face a future cross-border health threat. The proposal aims to provide EU added value through the development of an EU health crisis and pandemic preparedness plan, complemented by: national plans and transparent reporting of capacities; strengthened, integrated surveillance systems at EU level supported by improved data collection tools and artificial intelligence, environmental surveillance, to detect early signals of a possible threat; enhanced risk assessment for health threats; increased power to enforce a coordinated response at EU level through the Health Security Committee; and an improved mechanism for recognition of and response to public health emergencies. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications are related mainly to the following objectives: preparedness plans established at EU and national level accompanied by reporting and auditing; training programmes for specialists; digitalised, integrated surveillance system at EU level, better detection of early signals for accurate risk assessment and response; establishment of new EU networks of laboratories; reinforcement of risk assessments for chemical, environmental and climate threats; and established structure and processes for the recognition of emergency at EU level."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Special Partnership between the EU and Cabo Verde was approved by the Council of the European Union on 19 November 2007. One of its objectives is to increase mobility and people-to-people contacts between citizens of the Union and Cabo Verde, as well as to strengthen cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration. On 1 December 2014, the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union entered into force. After almost 5 years of implementation of these Agreements and in light of the supervened changes of both the EU and Cabo Verde’s domestic legislation related to visas, namely the revision of the EU’s Visa Code 3 and Cabo Verde decision to exempt EU citizens from the visa requirement for stays up to 30 days, the Joint Committee set up by the existing agreement explored the need to amend certain rules thereby established, with a view to adapt it to the changed circumstances. On that basis, the Commission presented on 13 September 2019, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate an Agreement amending the existing Visa Facilitation Agreement with the Republic of Cabo Verde. The Council having given its authorisation, the chief negotiators reached an agreement in principle on the draft text of the agreement, initialled on 24 July 2020 through an exchange of e-mails. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cabo Verde amending the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas to the citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union. The purpose of the agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement provides for the following: - the reduction of the visa fee for processing applications to 75% of the amount to be charged in accordance with the applicable domestic (i.e. EUR 60 for Cabo Verdean citizens); for children of at least 12 years of age (but under 18 years of age), the fee is further reduced by 50% compared to the generally applicable amount (i.e. EUR 30 for Cabo Verdean citizens); - simplification of the documents required to justify the purpose of the journey for certain categories of applicants, e.g. business people; spouses, children and parents of Union citizens or Cabo Verdean citizens legally residing in the EU; schoolchildren, students; participants in scientific, cultural, sporting or religious events, journalists and persons travelling for medical reasons; - the modification of the rules on the issuing of multiple-entry visas focusing on the previous lawful use of the visa during a given reference period rather than on the purpose of travel of the applicants; - the exemption from the visa requirement for short stays for holders of a valid EU laissez-passer; - the possibility for the parties to suspend the agreement in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate; - the amendment of the general clause of the agreement to ensure that: (i) the facilitation granted to Cabo Verdean citizens would be granted to EU citizens if the visa requirement for stays of up to 30 days re-imposed for their visit to Cabo Verde; (ii) at least the same facilitation are granted to EU citizens applying for a Cabo Verde visa for stays exceeding 30 days but not exceeding 90 days; - the amendment of the Joint Declaration on cooperation on travel documents to include a reference to Cabo Verde’s internal legislation introducing biometric travel documents."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2016/680 (data protection law enforcement Directive) required the Commission to review, by 6 May 2019 at the latest, other legal acts adopted by the EU which regulate the processing of personal data by competent authorities for law enforcement purposes, in order to assess the need to bring them into line with the Directive and to make, if appropriate, the necessary proposals to amend those acts to ensure a consistent approach to the protection of personal data under the Directive. The Commission set out the results of its review in a Communication of 24 June 2020 which identifies ten legal acts that should be aligned with the Directive and sets out a timetable for doing so. The list includes Council Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA on joint investigation teams. The Commission has indicated that it will present targeted amendments to this Decision in the last quarter of 2020; this is the purpose of this proposal. CONTENT: in the interests of consistency and effective protection of personal data, the Commission proposes that the processing of personal data carried out under Framework Decision 2002/465/JHA should comply with the rules set out in Directive (EU) 2016/680. In particular, the proposal for a Directive amends the Framework Decision by aligning the cases of use of personal data collected by joint investigation teams with the purpose limitation principle as regulated by the Data Protection Directive in the field of law enforcement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called “Open Skies” cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (the “horizontal authorisation”). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. CONTENT: in accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ”horizontal authorisation”, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the Republic of Korea that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of Korea. The objective of the Agreement is to bring bilateral air services agreements between 22 Member States and the Republic of Korea in line with Union law: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. - Article 4 safeguards the right of Member States under EU law to impose, on a non-discriminatory basis, taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel supplied in its territory for use in an aircraft of a designated air carrier of the Republic of Korea that operates between a point in the territory of that Member State and another point in the territory of that Member State or in the territory of another Member State. - Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union. With this proposal for a Decision, the Council is invited to approve on behalf of the Union the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Korea on certain aspects of air services."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the aim of the new agreement and protocol will enable 12 EU vessels to make use of fishing opportunities in Greenland’s waters for eight species: cod, pelagic redfish, demersal redfish, Greenland halibut, northern prawn, grenadier, capelin and Atlantic mackerel. The agreement will be valid for four years renewable for a further two. Members considered that the new agreement and protocol needed to be negotiated to bring them closer into line with fishing opportunities and scientific advice, to increase flexibility regarding catches, to introduce a lower by-catch quota and establish a six-year validity period for the protocol. In general, both the agreement and the protocol will contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular to reinforce monitoring, control and surveillance. The agreement provides for financial compensation from the EU of EUR 16 521 754, of which EUR 2 931 000 is earmarked for support for and the development of Greenland’s fisheries sector. It was stressed in the explanatory statement that the negotiations on the agreement and protocol thereto were held in parallel with the negotiations on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which delayed the conclusion of an agreement. It was also stressed that Brexit has destabilised relations with all North Atlantic countries and therefore particular attention needs to be paid to this state of affairs."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU faces a security landscape in flux, with evolving and increasingly complex security threats. Criminals and terrorists exploit the advantages that the digital transformation and new technologies bring about, including the inter-connectivity and blurring of the boundaries between the physical and digital world. The COVID-19 crisis has added to this, as criminals have quickly seized opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities. These threats spread across borders and manifest themselves in poly-criminal organised crime groups that engage in a wide range of criminal activities. As action at national level alone does not suffice to address these transnational security challenges, therefore the Commission proposes to enhance Europol’s mandate in order to give further support to Member States’ law enforcement authorities. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: this proposal aims to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ law enforcement services and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy. Specific provisions of the new mandate The new mandate should: - ensure effective cooperation between Europol and private parties: terrorists often abuse the services provided by private companies to recruit volunteers, to carry out terrorist attacks and to disseminate their propaganda. The revised mandate would allow private parties to refer such information directly to Europol. The Agency would be able to receive personal data directly from private parties and analyse it to identify all Member States concerned; request personal data from private parties (via the Member State where it is located); and act as a channel for Member States' requests to private parties, in compliance with data protection requirements; - enable Europol to exchange personal data with private parties related to crisis response: the proposal sets out rules for Europol to support Member States in preventing the large scale dissemination, via online platforms, of terrorist content related to on-going or recent real-world events depicting harm to life or physical integrity. Europol would be able to exchange personal data with private parties, including hashes, IP addresses or URLs related to such content; - allow Europol to analyse large datasets (‘big data') to support criminal investigations, considering that the processing of large data sets is an integral part of police work in today's digital world; - improve Europol's cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, including through analytical support to the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and information exchange, and with the European Anti-Fraud Office; - reinforce Europol's role in developing new technologies for law enforcement, helping to equip national law enforcement authorities with modern technologies to counter serious crime and terrorism; - strengthen Europol's data protection framework, accountability and democratic oversight, including by introducing new reporting obligations for Europol to the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group in charge of monitoring its activities. Budgetary implications The proposal would have an impact on the budget and staff needs of Europol. It is estimated that an additional budget of around EUR 180 million and around 160 additional posts would be needed for the overall MFF period to ensure that Europol has the necessary resources to enforce its revised mandate. This increase in staff and budget would give Europol the means to fulfil its strengthened mandate. It would provide the European Counter Terrorism Centre with adequate resources and to enable its EU Internet Referral Unit to monitor and refer all types of terrorist content to online platforms with a 24/7 availability. The revision of Europol's mandate also opens the possibility for Member States to contribute directly to Europol's budget, where necessary and required by existing or new tasks."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: given the increasingly global nature of serious crime and terrorism brought about by growing mobility, the information that third countries and international organisations obtain about criminals and terrorists is increasingly relevant for the EU‘s security. Such information should contribute to the comprehensive efforts to ensure internal security in the European Union. Some of this information is only shared with Europol. While Europol holds valuable information received from external partners on serious criminals and terrorists, it cannot issue alerts in SIS. Member States are also not always able to issue alerts in SIS on the basis of such information. In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on serious crime and terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters – where the monitoring of their movement is crucial – it is necessary to ensure Europol is able to make this information available directly and in real-time to front-line officers in Member States. Europol should therefore be authorised to enter alerts in SIS, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. To that end, the Commission proposes that a specific category of alert should be created in SIS, to be issued exclusively by Europol, in order to inform end-users carrying out a search in SIS that the person concerned is suspected of being involved in a criminal offence in respect of which Europol is competent, and in order for Europol to obtain confirmation that the person who is subject to the alert has been located. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: the present proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol. In particular, it widens the scope of application of the current SIS by introducing a new alert category for Europol. Specific provisions The proposal seeks to: - enable Europol to issue ‘information alerts’ on suspects and criminals as a new alert category in SIS, for exclusive use by Europol in specific and well-defined cases and circumstances. This is an important paradigm change for SIS, as until now, only Member States could enter, update and delete data in SIS and Europol had ‘read-only’ access covering all alert categories. Europol would be able to issue alerts on the basis of its analysis of third-country sourced information or information from international organisations, within the scope of crimes falling under Europol’s mandate and only on third-country nationals who are not beneficiaries of free movement rights. The purpose of the new alert category is that in case of a ‘hit’, the alert would inform the frontline officer that Europol holds information on the person; - set out detailed provisions on the procedural requirements that Europol is required to fulfil prior to entering an alert in SIS; - align the obligations and requirements of Europol when entering alerts in SIS with alert issuing Member States. These requirements concern: categories of data, proportionality, minimum data content for an alert to be entered, entering biometric data, general data processing rules, quality of the data in SIS as well as rules on distinguishing between persons with similar characteristics, misused identity and links. The frontline officer would be required to report immediately the occurrence of the ‘hit’ to the national SIRENE Bureau, which would in turn contact Europol. The frontline officer would only report that the person who is subject of an alert was located and would indicate the place, time and reason for the check carried out; - define the review period for alerts entered by Europol as well as the alert deletion rules which are specific to this type of alert. As a general rule, an alert should be kept only for the time that is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact, estimated at EUR 1 820 000 for the period 2021-2022, reflects the changes required for establishing this new alert category in Central SIS by eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the management and development of Central SIS. The expenses related to the development of the national systems connected to Central SIS are to be covered by the resources available to the Member States under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 for the development and maintenance of SIS. The proposal would also require Europol to set up a technical interface for entering, updating and deleting data in Central SIS."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current health security framework, established by Decision 1082/2013/EU on serious cross-border threats to health, provides a limited legal framework for EU level coordination, based essentially on a) an early warning system (EWRS) and the exchange of information and cooperation within the HSC. Early lessons learnt have shown that the current system has not allowed an optimal response at EU level to the COVID-19 pandemic. Structures and mechanisms under the Decision, while key in facilitating the exchange of information on the evolution of the pandemic and in supporting the adoption of national measures, could do little to trigger a timely common EU level response, co-ordinate the crucial aspects of risk communication, or ensure solidarity among Member States. The revision of the health security framework proposes a stronger and more comprehensive legal basis for the EU to prepare and respond to health crises. In addition, the proposal is part of a package of closely associated measures that aim to enhance the roles of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). CONTENT: the overarching aim of the proposed regulation is to provide a strengthened framework for health crisis preparedness and response at EU level by addressing the weaknesses exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, it would: set out a comprehensive legislative framework to govern action at EU level on preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, and early warning and responses; and enhance the EU’s guidance in the adoption of common measures at EU level to face a future cross-border health threat. The proposal aims to provide EU added value through the development of an EU health crisis and pandemic preparedness plan, complemented by: national plans and transparent reporting of capacities; strengthened, integrated surveillance systems at EU level supported by improved data collection tools and artificial intelligence, environmental surveillance, to detect early signals of a possible threat; enhanced risk assessment for health threats; increased power to enforce a coordinated response at EU level through the Health Security Committee; and an improved mechanism for recognition of and response to public health emergencies. Budgetary implications The financial impact of this proposal on the EU budget should be part of the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. The budgetary implications are related mainly to the following objectives: preparedness plans established at EU and national level accompanied by reporting and auditing; training programmes for specialists; digitalised, integrated surveillance system at EU level, better detection of early signals for accurate risk assessment and response; establishment of new EU networks of laboratories; reinforcement of risk assessments for chemical, environmental and climate threats; and established structure and processes for the recognition of emergency at EU level."

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to allocate the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff-rate quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows in the EU-27 and the UK over a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members, including Australia, with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. Australia has negotiating rights for 14 tariff quotas and consultation rights for 6 tariff quotas. Negotiations with Australia resulted in an agreement that was initialled on 18 December 2020 in Geneva."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 is an important instrument for judicial cooperation in civil matters at EU level. It contains a comprehensive set of rules directly applicable to cross-border insolvency proceedings which are referred to in Annex A and to types of insolvency practitioners referred to in Annex B. These two annexes list exhaustively, respectively, the insolvency proceedings and the insolvency practitioners provided for in the laws of the Member States and to which the Regulation applies. It is therefore important that these annexes are regularly updated to take account of the current legal situation in the Member States. In October 2020, the Netherlands notified the Commission of recent changes to its national insolvency legislation, introducing a new preventive insolvency regime and new categories of insolvency practitioners. Notifications were subsequently received from Italy, Lithuania, Cyprus and Poland in December 2020. The Commission has analysed the notifications from these Member States carefully to ensure that they meet the requirements of the Regulation.

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/1091 on integrated farm statistics requires Member States to carry out integrated farm surveys in 2020, 2023 and 2026. The Regulation contains a provision on the establishment of the budget for the collection of data for the surveys to be carried out in 2023 and 2026. It establishes the financial envelope for the entire duration of the relevant multiannual financial framework (MFF). In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1091, the amount of the Union contribution to integrated farm statistics under the MFF 2021-2027 should be fixed by the European Parliament and the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, once the MFF 2021-2027 has entered into force. The proposal is part of the strategy for agricultural statistics for 2020 and beyond, a major programme to modernise EU agricultural statistics produced by the European Commission in close cooperation with the Member States. It aims to ensure the quality and comparability of European agricultural statistics collected and compiled according to the same principles in all Member States. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the financing of integrated statistics on agricultural holdings for the period 2021-2027. It establishes a budget of EUR 40 million for the period 2021-2027 (of which EUR 36.4 million is for grants to national statistical institutes and other national authorities). The amount proposed for 2021-2027 should finance the farm structure surveys conducted in 2023 and 2026 only, including the costs related to the management, maintenance and development of the databases used by the Commission to process the data supplied by Member States. The EU's financial contribution for the grants should be provided by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 enables retail investors to better understand and compare packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and make better-informed investment decisions. To meet its objectives, Regulation requires PRIIPs manufacturers to comply with a uniform set of product disclosure requirements and provide retail investors with a key information document (KID) on each PRIIP they offer. Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a KID. This arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 supplements Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by laying down regulatory technical standards with regard to the presentation, content and standard format of the key information document. The Commission adopted Commission Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 to make it easier for management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS. However, the date of application of Delegated Regulation has been set on 1 July 2022 to give those management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and thus for the obligation to draw up a key information document. This proposal is accompanied by a proposal amending Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the use of key information documents by management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and implement the other proposed measure (which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653). Under this proposal, Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 would apply to management companies, investment companies and persons advising on or selling units of UCITS and non-UCITS on the same date as the amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653, i.e. from 1 July 2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Directive 2009/65/EC, each undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) must provide ‘key investor information’ to help investors understand the essential characteristics of the UCITS and make informed investment decisions. Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a key information document. The arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. The Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and to implement the other proposed measure [which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653] from 1 July 2022. As things stand, as of 1 July 2022 retail investors in UCITS would receive both a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and key investor information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC. It is desirable to avoid a situation where retail investors receive two different pre-contractual disclosure documents in respect of the same UCITS. The proposed measures are necessary to reduce the consequences of parallel application of Directive 2009/65/EC and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. CONTENT: this proposal inserts a new article in Directive 2009/65/EC which lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner that, where a key information document is drawn up, provided, revised and translated for a UCITS pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, it should be considered as satisfying the requirements applicable to key investor information for the purposes of that Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: adequate minimum wages are a fundamental component of the European model of social market economy. When set at adequate levels, minimum wages protect the income of disadvantaged workers, help ensure a decent living, and limit the fall in income during bad times. During economic recessions, such as the COVID-19 crisis, the role of minimum wages in protecting low-wage workers is essential to support a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. Principle 6 of the Pillar on ‘Wages’ calls for adequate minimum wages as well as for transparent and predictable wage setting to be put in place, according to national practices and respecting the autonomy of the social partners. Minimum wage protection can be provided by collective agreements (as is the case in six Member States) or by statutory minimum wages set by law (as is the case in 21 Member States). However, many workers are currently not protected by adequate minimum wages in the EU. In the majority of Member States with national statutory minimum wages, minimum wages are too low vis-à-vis other wages or to provide a decent living, even if they have increased in recent years. National statutory minimum wages are lower than 60% of the gross median wage and/or 50% of the gross average wage in almost all Member States. In 2018, the statutory minimum wage did not provide sufficient income for a single minimum-wage earner to reach the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in nine Member States. In this context, the proposed directive aims to ensure that EU workers are protected by adequate minimum wages allowing for a decent living wherever they work. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the quantitative analysis carried out on a scenario based on a hypothetical increase of minimum wages to 60% of the gross median wage shows that it would improve the adequacy of minimum wages in about half of the Member States. Between 10 and 20 million workers would benefit from these improvements. In several countries, improvements in minimum wage protection would result in a reduction of in-work poverty and wage inequality by over 10% and a reduction in the gender pay gap by about 5% or more. CONTENT: the proposed directive establishes minimum requirements at EU level to ensure both that minimum wages are set at an adequate level and that workers can have access to the protection offered by minimum wages, either in the form of a statutory minimum wage or in the form of wages set by collective agreements. The proposal respects Member States’ competence to set higher standards, without prejudice to the role that Member States may entrust to social partners, in accordance with national traditions and in full respect of social partners’ contractual freedom. The proposed Directive: - would apply to workers with an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by law, collective agreements or practice in each Member State, including workers in atypical forms of employment ; - would oblige Member States to take measures to promote the capacity of the social partners to engage in collective bargaining on wages to encourage wage bargaining. In the case of countries where there is a legal minimum wage, the proposal: - requires Member States to provide for national criteria for setting and updating statutory minimum wages that are defined in a stable and clear manner, regular and timely updates and the establishment of consultative bodies; - calls on the Member States, in consultation with the social partners to: (i) limit the use of variations in minimum wages and their application over time and their extent and (ii) provide for the protection of statutory minimum wages against unjustified or disproportionate deductions; - requires effective and timely participation of the social partners in the setting and updating of statutory minimum wages, including through participation in consultative bodies; - Requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that workers have effective access to the protection offered by statutory minimum wages (e.g. strengthening the system of controls and field inspections, informing workers about applicable statutory minimum wages). With a view to monitoring the implementation of this Directive, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council its assessment of developments in the adequacy and coverage of minimum wages on the basis of the information provided by Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/746 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices establishes a new regulatory framework for in vitro diagnostic medical devices, such as HIV tests, pregnancy tests or SARS-CoV-2 tests. The new Regulation will replace the current Directive 98/79/EC on in vitro diagnostic medical devices from 26 May 2022 and introduce substantial changes in the sector. One of the main changes concerns the involvement of independent conformity assessment bodies (‘notified bodies’). Currently, only a relatively small number of high-risk devices (about 8% of all in vitro diagnostics on the market) is subject to notified body control under Directive 98/79/EC. Under the Regulation, around 80% of in vitro diagnostic medical devices will be under the control of notified bodies, the vast majority of them for the first time. The COVID-19 public health crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that demand substantial additional resources, as well as increased availability of vitally important in vitro diagnostic medical devices, that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of Regulation (EU) 2017/746. Data on market readiness collected by the European Commission show that Member States, health institutions, notified bodies and economic operators will not be in a position to comply with the new rules within the timeframe foreseen. In vitro diagnostic medical devices are essential for the health and safety of Union citizens and SARS-CoV-2 tests, in particular, are vital for the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the transitional arrangements to allow for a gradual implementation of the Regulation in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these devices on the Union market. The European Parliament, in a cross-party letter of 11 May 2021 signed by several political groups, called on the Commission to present a legislative proposal to smooth the transition to the new regulatory framework and to ensure the availability of in vitro diagnostic medical devices on the EU market. CONTENT: in order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid potential market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend the existing transitional period for devices covered by a certificate issued under Directive 98/79/EC and to introduce tailored transitional periods for devices that are to be subject to conformity assessment involving notified bodies for the first time under Regulation (EU) 2017/746. The length of the transitional period should depend on the risk class of the device concerned: - for high-risk devices such as HIV or hepatitis tests (class D) and certain influenza tests (class C), the transitional period ends on 26 May 2025 and 26 May 2026, and - for low-risk devices such as Class B and A sterile devices, 26 May 2027. The Commission proposes to also introduce a transitional period for the requirements for devices manufactured and used within the same health institution (‘in-house devices’). This will give health institutions extra time to comply with the new requirements and ensure that in-house tests, which are often essential –especially for rare diseases, can continue to be developed in clinical laboratories."

Data on market readiness collected by the European Commission show that Member States, health institutions, notified bodies and economic operators will not be in a position to comply with the new rules within the timeframe foreseen. In vitro diagnostic medical devices are essential for the health and safety of Union citizens and SARS-CoV-2 tests, in particular, are vital for the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the transitional arrangements to allow for a gradual implementation of the Regulation in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of these devices on the Union market. The European Parliament, in a cross-party letter of 11 May 2021 signed by several political groups, called on the Commission to present a legislative proposal to smooth the transition to the new regulatory framework and to ensure the availability of in vitro diagnostic medical devices on the EU market. CONTENT: in order to ensure legal certainty and to avoid potential market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend the existing transitional period for devices covered by a certificate issued under Directive 98/79/EC and to introduce tailored transitional periods for devices that are to be subject to conformity assessment involving notified bodies for the first time under Regulation (EU) 2017/746. The length of the transitional period should depend on the risk class of the device concerned: - for high-risk devices such as HIV or hepatitis tests (class D) and certain influenza tests (class C), the transitional period ends on 26 May 2025 and 26 May 2026, and - for low-risk devices such as Class B and A sterile devices, 26 May 2027. The Commission proposes to also introduce a transitional period for the requirements for devices manufactured and used within the same health institution (‘in-house devices’). This will give health institutions extra time to comply with the new requirements and ensure that in-house tests, which are often essential –especially for rare diseases, can continue to be developed in clinical laboratories."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the Union and the UK notified the other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that their current market access level will be maintained but apportioned respectively between the Union and the United Kingdom. The methodology for this apportionment, as well as the new EU-27 volumes, are laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Paraguay has a tariff rate quota of 1 000 tonnes for high quality bovine meat (order number 094455), which is not included in the EU’s WTO schedule. This tariff rate quotas was erroneously included in the apportionment exercise and thus reduced to 711 tonnes on the EU-27 side without any corresponding volume being opened on the UK side. This means Paraguay’s market access has been reduced from 1 000 tonnes to 711 tonnes with application as of 1 January 2021. It is therefore appropriate to restore this tariff quota to its original volume. This initiative is in line with the EU’s ongoing actions to ensure that the consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU are dealt with in an orderly manner. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 in order to restore the correct volume (1000 tonnes) of tariff quota No 094455 for EU-27. The row relating to order number 094455 (High quality meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen from Paraguay) would thus be deleted from the Annex, Part A of Regulation (EU) 2019/216."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement represented a significant change in transatlantic aviation relations, providing broad new commercial freedoms for airlines and a comprehensive framework for regulatory cooperation with the United States on a wide range of issues. The 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement created substantial benefits for airlines, airports and air transport users in Europe. However, the EU was seeking additional investment and market access opportunities. Therefore, Article 21 of the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement established a non-exhaustive list of 'items of priority interest' for the second stage negotiations, including additional investment and market access opportunities, as well as environmental issues. After eight rounds of second stage negotiations, agreement was reached on 25 March 2010 on a draft Protocol to Amend the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement. The Protocol aims at: launching a process towards additional foreign investment opportunities in the airline industry, further opening market access, including further access by EU airlines to US Government-financed air transportation, and further strengthening the regulatory cooperation in all fields of aviation policy, particularly on addressing the environmental impact of aviation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Protocol further increases the benefits for consumers, airlines, labour, and communities in the Union: (1) in a study carried out for the Commission, the economic benefits of a fully Open Aviation Area between the EU and the United States have been estimated at several billion Euros per year; (2) another study estimates that further regulatory convergence in the field of air transport could significantly reduce costs for the industry. The same study concluded that the second stage negotiations have the potential to change the structure of the market in the EU and in the US, increasing profitability in the airline industry; (3) the inclusion of an article on the social dimension ensures that the further market opening will be accompanied by high labour standards and that labour-related rights will not be undermined by the new opportunities created by the Protocol; (4) lastly, the Protocol includes firm commitments from both Parties to limit or reduce the impact of international aviation on the environment. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2) and (5), as well Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons: (i) an amendment of an international treaty at Union level can only be done at Union level; (ii) the objectives of the Protocol can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. CONTENT: the Protocol amends the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement with the following provisions: a legal obligation to reciprocally recognise the regulatory determinations of the other Party with regard to airline fitness and citizenship; an enhanced cooperation to limit the impact of international aviation on the environment. The cooperation on addressing the environmental impacts of international aviation will include the areas of research and development, air traffic management innovation, coordination in international fora; an explicit recognition of the importance of the social dimension and the benefits of high labour standards as well as an enhanced cooperation on the social effects of the agreement; a strengthened role of the Joint Committee, enabling it to address incompatible regulatory approaches, allow for reciprocal recognition of decision-making, and promote cooperation across a number of additional fields, including air traffic management, facilitation, safety and cooperation with other countries; a process towards further market access and investment opportunities. Both sides commit to continuing to remove market access barriers. The Joint Committee will regularly review progress in that respect. Both sides will establish a process of cooperation in the Joint Committee towards the shared goal of removing market access barriers; further access of EU airlines to air transport funded by the US Government that is restricted currently to US airlines (""Fly America""). EU airlines will be able to sell air transportation to contractors of the US Government on any route, with exception of transport financed by the US Department of Defence. The Protocol is accompanied by a Memorandum of Consultations that includes additional new elements, in order to further enhance the existing cooperation in the areas of aviation security, competition policy, and the joint efforts to address the environmental impact of international aviation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Gabon and the European Community was signed on 4 June 2007 and entered into force on 11 June 2007 for a period of six years. The agreement is renewable by tacit agreement and is still in force. A previous three-year protocol implementing the JPA entered into force on 24 July 2013 and expired on 23 July 2016. In 2015, the Commission carried out an ex-post evaluation of the 2013-2016 JPA protocol, as well as an ex-ante evaluation of a possible renewal of the protocol. The evaluation concluded that the EU fishing sector has a strong interest in operating in Gabon and that a renewal of the protocol would be in the interest of both parties. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Gabon with a view to concluding, on behalf of the EU, a new protocol for the implementation of the FPA (2021-2026). Following these negotiations, a protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 10 February 2021. The new protocol covers a period of five years from the date of its signature by both parties. The negotiation of a new protocol for the implementation of the sustainable fisheries partnership agreement with Gabon is part of the Union's external action towards the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and takes particular account of the Union's objectives regarding respect for democratic principles and human rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve the protocol for the implementation (2021-2026) of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Gabonese Republic and the European Community. Objectives The conclusion of the implementing protocol will allow the strategic partnership in the field of fisheries between the European Union and Gabon to be continued and strengthened. The conclusion of the protocol will create fishing opportunities for EU vessels in the Gabonese fishing zone. The agreement and the protocol will also contribute to: - better management and conservation of fisheries resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the global plan for fisheries, the monitoring of and fight against illegal fishing, and support for the artisanal fisheries sector; - Gabon's sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and Gabon's fisheries economy by promoting growth in fisheries-related economic activities and the establishment of decent working conditions. Fishing opportunities The new protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 27 purse seine tuna vessels; - 6 pole-and-line tuna vessels; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the limits set by Gabonese legislation; - 4 trawlers targeting demersal fish and crustaceans to be authorised according to the results of exploratory campaigns. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution amounts to EUR 2 600 000, based on: (a) an annual amount of EUR 1 600 000 for access to fisheries resources in the Gabonese fishing zone, equivalent to a reference tonnage for highly migratory species of 32 000 tonnes per year; (b) support for the development of Gabon's sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 1 000 000 per year. This support is in line with the objectives of the strategic plan for fisheries in Gabon. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations will be established during the annual budget procedure."

The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, exercising its prerogatives as an association committee in accordance with Rule 50 of the Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, was also consulted for an opinion on the report. The committee recommended that Parliament’s position adopted in first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows: A sustainable industry policy strategy in the Union : the committee stressed the need to exclude unfair tenders comprising goods and/or services originating outside the Union. At the same time, reciprocity and fair conditions for the market access of Union industries should be ensured. Keep the principle of uniformity of the Common Commercial Policy (CCP): to prevent distortion of the internal market, and ensure efficient leverage through the CCP, Members stated that that Member States or their contracting authorities may restrict the access of third country goods and services to their tendering procedures only by measures provided for in the Regulation or by relevant Union law, and only after an investigation by the Commission has revealed the absence of substantial reciprocity by the third country concerned. Scope: the Regulation shall apply to the award of contracts and to the award of concessions for services provided for governmental purposes. It is proposed to exclude from the scope of the Regulation developing countries considered to be vulnerable due to a lack of diversification and insufficient integration within the international trading system as well as countries and potential GSP+ beneficiary countries. Rules of origin : the determination of the origin of a service should be made in line with the principles of the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The provisions determining the rules of origin of services should prevent the circumvention of restrictions on access to the Union public procurement market through the establishment of ""letterbox"" companies. Procedure : Members wanted to ensure that the term 'calendar days' is consistently used throughout the proposal instead of 'days', 'calendar days' and 'working days'. They also shortened the length of the procedures throughout the proposal to provide faster protection, and made amendments intended to avoid an endless consultation procedure with third countries. Public contracts : in the performance of public contracts economic operators must comply with applicable obligations in the fields of environmental, social and labour law established by Union law, national law, collective agreements or by the international environmental, social and labour law provisions. A ‘lack of substantial reciprocity’ shall be presumed, where the non-observance of international labour law provisions listed in the Directive on public procurement. Assess impact and review the instrument : the report proposes incorporating a review clause, which obliges the Commission to look into the impact of the regulation, after it has come into force and being applied for a few years. Accordingly, when the Commission submits its second report, it shall also submit a legislative proposal for an amended Regulation or set out the reasons why, in its view, no changes are necessary. For the same reason, the report suggests limiting the application of any restrictive measures taken through an implementing act to up to 5 years so as to avoid these measures turning into a permanent closure of the market."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: digital services cover a wide range of daily activities including online intermediation services, such as online marketplaces, online social networking services, online search engines, operating systems or software application stores. They increase consumer choice, improve efficiency and competitiveness of industry and can enhance civil participation in society. However, whereas over 10 000 online platforms operate in Europe’s digital economy, most of which are SMEs, a small number of large online platforms capture the biggest share of the overall value generated. These large platforms increasingly act as gateways or gatekeepers between business users and end users and enjoy an entrenched and durable position. The proposed Digital Markets Act aims at preventing gatekeepers from imposing unfair conditions on businesses and consumers and at ensuring the openness of important digital services. Common rules across the single market are needed to foster innovation, growth and competitiveness, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, small and medium-sized enterprises and start-ups who will have a single, clear framework at EU level. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the aim of the proposed regulation is to lay down harmonised rules ensuring contestable and fair markets in the digital sector across the EU where gatekeepers are present. It should apply to core platform services provided or offered by gatekeepers to business users established in the EU or end users established or located in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment or residence of the gatekeepers and irrespective of the law otherwise applicable to the provision of service. Its main objectives are: - to address market failures to ensure contestable and competitive digital markets for increased innovation and consumer choice; - to address gatekeepers’ unfair conduct; - to enhance coherence and legal certainty to preserve the internal market. Specific provisions of the proposal The proposal: - should only apply to large companies that would be designated as ‘gatekeepers’. For this purpose, it contains the provisions concerning the designation of gatekeepers. More specifically, it establishes the conditions under which providers of core platform services should be designated as gatekeepers either based on the quantitative criteria (through a presumption subject to counter-demonstration) or following a case-by-case assessment during a market investigation; - sets out the practices of gatekeepers that limit contestability and that are unfair; - provides rules for carrying out market investigations: (i) designation of a gatekeeper; (ii) investigation of systematic non-compliance and (iii) investigation of new core platform services and new practices; - contains the provisions concerning the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation. These include the Commission's ability to request information, to conduct interviews and make statements and on-site inspections, to adopt interim measures and to make voluntary measures binding on the gate-keepers. In case of non-compliance, the Commission can issue non-compliance decisions, as well as impose fines and periodic penalty payments for breaches of the Regulation. Budgetary implications The total financial resources necessary for the implementation of the proposal in the 2021-2027 period should amount to EUR 81.090 million, including EUR 50.640 million of administrative costs and EUR 30.450 million entirely covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme. The financing should support inter alia activities such as carrying out the designation of providers of core platform services, carrying out market investigations and performing any other investigative actions, enforcement actions and monitoring activities."

Its main objectives are: - to address market failures to ensure contestable and competitive digital markets for increased innovation and consumer choice; - to address gatekeepers’ unfair conduct; - to enhance coherence and legal certainty to preserve the internal market. Specific provisions of the proposal The proposal: - should only apply to large companies that would be designated as ‘gatekeepers’. For this purpose, it contains the provisions concerning the designation of gatekeepers. More specifically, it establishes the conditions under which providers of core platform services should be designated as gatekeepers either based on the quantitative criteria (through a presumption subject to counter-demonstration) or following a case-by-case assessment during a market investigation; - sets out the practices of gatekeepers that limit contestability and that are unfair; - provides rules for carrying out market investigations: (i) designation of a gatekeeper; (ii) investigation of systematic non-compliance and (iii) investigation of new core platform services and new practices; - contains the provisions concerning the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation. These include the Commission's ability to request information, to conduct interviews and make statements and on-site inspections, to adopt interim measures and to make voluntary measures binding on the gate-keepers. In case of non-compliance, the Commission can issue non-compliance decisions, as well as impose fines and periodic penalty payments for breaches of the Regulation. Budgetary implications The total financial resources necessary for the implementation of the proposal in the 2021-2027 period should amount to EUR 81.090 million, including EUR 50.640 million of administrative costs and EUR 30.450 million entirely covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme. The financing should support inter alia activities such as carrying out the designation of providers of core platform services, carrying out market investigations and performing any other investigative actions, enforcement actions and monitoring activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: information society services and especially intermediary services have become an important part of the EU’s economy and daily life of Union citizens. Twenty years after the adoption of the existing legal framework applicable to such services laid down in e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC, new and innovative business models and services, such as online social networks and marketplaces, have allowed business users and consumers to impart and access information and engage in transactions in novel ways. A majority of EU citizens now use those services on a daily basis. However, the digital transformation and increased use of those services has also resulted in new risks and challenges, both for individual users and for society as a whole. The proposed Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act encompass a single set of new rules applicable across the whole EU. They will create a safer and more open digital space, with European values at its centre. CONTENT: the main objective of this proposal is to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular in relation to the provision of cross-border digital services (more specifically, intermediary services). It aims to ensure harmonised conditions for innovative cross-border services to develop in the EU, by addressing and preventing the emergence of obstacles to such economic activity resulting from differences in the way national laws develop, taking into account that several Member States have legislated or intend to legislate on issues such as the removal of illegal content online, diligence, notice and action procedures and transparency. The proposed regulation lays down harmonised rules on the provision of intermediary services in the internal market. In particular, it establishes: - a framework for the conditional exemption from liability of providers of intermediary services; - rules on specific due diligence obligations tailored to certain specific categories of providers of intermediary services; - rules on the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, including as regards the cooperation of and coordination between the competent authorities. This proposal should apply to intermediary services provided to recipients of the service that have their place of establishment or residence in the Union, irrespective of the place of establishment of the providers of those services. Specific provisions The proposal lays down: - measures to counter illegal goods, services or content online, such as a mechanism for users to flag such content and for platforms to cooperate with ‘trusted flaggers’; - new obligations on traceability of business users in online marketplaces, to help identify sellers of illegal goods; - effective safeguards for users, including the possibility to challenge platforms’ content moderation decisions; - transparency measures for online platforms on a variety of issues, including on the algorithms used for recommendations; - obligations for very large platforms to prevent the misuse of their systems by taking risk-based action and by independent audits of their risk management systems; - access for researchers to key data of the largest platforms, in order to understand how online risks evolve; - oversight structures to address the complexity of the online space: EU countries will have the primary role, supported by a new European Board for Digital Services; for very large platforms, enhanced supervision and enforcement by the Commission. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact of the proposal should be covered by the allocations foreseen in the multiannual financial framework 2021-2027 under the financial envelopes of the Single Market Programme and the Digital Europe Programme."

BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp drop in rail traffic, because of a significant fall in demand. This has had a serious impact on railway undertakings. Those circumstances are beyond the control of railway undertakings that have continuously faced considerable liquidity problems, major losses and in some cases are risking insolvency. In order to counteract the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and support railway undertakings, Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 of the European Parliament and of the Council enabled Member States to authorise infrastructure managers to reduce, waive or defer charges for accessing rail infrastructure.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Ukraine relations continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine, providing for a deep and comprehensive free trade area, entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has been carrying out an ambitious reform programme aimed at stabilising its economy and improving the living conditions of its population. The fight against corruption as well as constitutional, electoral and judicial reforms are among the main priorities. The implementation of these reforms has been supported by five consecutive macro-financial assistance programmes, under which Ukraine has received loans totalling EUR 5 billion over the period 2014-2021. In order to allow for greater policy flexibility in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement with Ukraine in June 2020 for an amount equivalent to USD 5 billion. The Ukrainian economy has been affected by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the persistent security threats on the country's border with Russia. Inflation accelerated and reached 10% by the end of 2021. The worsening geopolitical tensions on Ukraine's border with Russia have had a profound impact on confidence, particularly among foreign investors. According to the latest IMF projections, the lack of access to capital markets is expected to widen the country's funding gap by at least USD 2.5 billion in 2022 and significantly increase risks to the country's macroeconomic outlook. It is against this background of increased geopolitical uncertainty, which prevents Ukraine from accessing international capital markets and affects its economic situation, that the Commission is presenting a proposal to provide Ukraine with new MFA in the form of loans to foster stability in the country. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the EU makes available to Ukraine macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 1.2 billion with a view to facilitating macroeconomic stabilisation and the implementation of a comprehensive reform programme. The planned emergency MFA, put forward to provide swift support in a situation of acute crisis and to strengthen the resilience of the country, will have a duration of 12 months and include two disbursements: - the release of the first tranche, subject to the political precondition and a satisfactory implementation of the IMF programme, would occur swiftly after the approval of this proposal, upon entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on specific structural policy measures, agreed between the European Commission on behalf of the EU and Ukraine; - the disbursement of the second tranche would be linked to the continuous satisfactory implementation of both an IMF programme and the policy measures agreed in the MoU. The MoU underpinning this emergency macro-financial assistance operation is likely to focus on a limited number of feasible, short-term policy actions in the most urgent priority areas, such as strengthening economic resilience and stability, governance and rule of law, and energy. The implementation of the proposed operation is expected to go hand-in-hand with the support under budgetary operations financed by the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The announced additional allocation of EUR 120 million in NDICI grants will be important to further strengthen Ukraine’s state-building and resilience efforts. A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems and promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, decent employment creation and fiscal consolidation. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service. In order for the European Parliament and the Council to follow the implementation of this decision, the Commission will have to inform them regularly on developments related to the assistance. Budgetary implications The proposed macro-financial assistance operation in favour of Ukraine would be disbursed in two equal instalments, to be disbursed over 12 months. These funds will be borrowed on the capital market and then lent to Ukraine. The loan will benefit from the external action guarantee. The required provisioning (corresponding to 9% of the loan amount) will be provided under the Neighbourhood, Development Cooperation and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 108 million."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the draft Council decision. The Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the North Pacific Ocean was signed on 24 February 2012 and entered into force on 19 July 2015. Its aim is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the Convention Area while protecting the North Pacific marine ecosystems in which those resources occur. By acceding to the Convention, the Union intends to give the Member States and Union vessels concerned access to the fishery resources in the Convention area. Accession to the North Pacific Ocean Convention creates new opportunities for EU vessels. It would promote consistency in the EU's approach to conservation across the world’s oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources globally. With a view to reaching its objectives, the Convention provides for the following actions to be taken: - promoting the optimum utilization and ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources; - adopting measures, based on the best scientific information available, to ensure that fisheries resources are maintained at or restored to levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield; - adopting and implementing measures in accordance with the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries, and in accordance with the relevant rules of international law; - assessing the impacts of fishing activities on species belonging to the same ecosystem or dependent upon or associated with the target stocks and adopting, where necessary, conservation and management measures for such species; - protecting biodiversity in the marine environment; - preventing or eliminating overfishing and excess fishing capacity; - ensuring that complete and accurate data concerning fishing activities are collected and shared in a timely and appropriate manner; - ensuring that any expansion of fishing effort, development of new or exploratory fisheries, or change in the gear used for existing fisheries, does not proceed without prior assessment of the impacts of those fishing activities on the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources; - ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures and that sanctions applicable in respect of violations are adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance, to discourage violations wherever they occur and to deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities; - minimising pollution and waste originating from fishing vessels, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, and impacts on other species and marine ecosystems."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a shift from the use of fossil fuels in vehicles to electromobility is one of the prerequisites for reaching the climate neutrality goal in 2050. Batteries are thus an important source of energy and one of the key enablers for sustainable development, green mobility, clean energy and climate neutrality. The current regulatory framework, with Directive 2006/66/EC on batteries, only covers the end-of-life stage of batteries. There are currently no legal provisions in the EU that cover other aspects of the production and use phases of batteries, such as electrochemical performance and durability, GHG emissions, or responsible sourcing. According to estimates from the World Economic Forum, there is a need to scale up global battery production by a factor of 19 to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The Commission is therefore proposing to modernise EU legislation on batteries, implementing its first initiative among the measures announced in the new action plan for the circular economy. In addition to the Commission’s work, both the Council and the Parliament have called for action to support the transition to electro-mobility, carbon-neutral energy storage, and a sustainable battery value chain. CONTENT: this proposal introduces gradual requirements to minimise the carbon footprint throughout the life cycle of batteries. Its objective is three-fold: 1) to strengthen the functioning of the internal market (including products, processes, battery waste and recycled materials) by ensuring a level playing field through a common set of rules; 2) to promote a circular economy; and 3) reduce environmental and social impacts throughout all the stages of the battery life cycle Minimum sustainability requirements In order to encourage the production and placing on the EU market of high quality and efficient batteries, the proposed Regulation establishes requirements on sustainability, safety and labelling to allow the placing on the market and putting into service of batteries, as well as requirements for the collection, treatment and recycling of waste batteries. The Regulation would apply to all types of batteries, i.e. portable batteries, automotive batteries, electric vehicle batteries and industrial batteries. The proposal also sets out requirements to ensure the proper functioning of the market for secondary raw materials while preventing and reducing the environmental impacts of the production and use of batteries, as well as their treatment (including recycling) at the end of the battery's life. Carbon footprint of electric vehicle batteries and rechargeable industrial batteries The proposal provides for the following: - as of 1 July 2024, only industrial rechargeable batteries and electric vehicle batteries for which a carbon footprint statement has been drawn up could be placed on the market; - as of 1 January 2026, batteries should be classified into carbon footprint performance classes; - as of 1 July 2027, batteries should comply with maximum life-cycle carbon footprint thresholds; - as of 1 January 2030, industrial and electric-vehicle batteries with internal storage should contain the following minimum share of recovered cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel from waste of the cobalt, lead, lithium or nickel present in active materials in those batteries: 12% cobalt; 85% lead, 4% lithium and 4% nickel; - as of 1 January 2035, the minimum share of recovered cobalt, lithium or nickel should increase to 20% cobalt, 10% lithium and 12% nickel. For lead the minimum share shall stay at 85%. Increasing the resilience of the EU battery supply chain by closing the materials loop To close the loop and keep recovered materials used in batteries in the European economy for as long as possible, the Commission proposes to set new requirements and targets for the recycled content and the collection, treatment and recycling of batteries at the end of their life cycle. The proposal sets collection rates for waste portable batteries to be achieved by Member States, excluding currently waste batteries from light means of transport. The collection rates should gradually increase so to ensure that by end 2025 65% of waste portable batteries are collected and by end 2030 70% of such batteries are collected. The proposal also contains requirements for re-purposing and remanufacturing operations to give a second life to industrial and electric vehicle batteries. Persons carrying out the repurposing or remanufacturing of batteries should ensure that the examination, performance testing, packing and shipment of batteries and their components is carried out following adequate quality control and safety instructions. Battery passports By 1 January 2026 at the latest, a ‘passport’ should be created for batteries, with a view to enabling economic operators to collect and re-use information and data on each battery placed on the market more efficiently and to make better informed choices in their planning activities. Budgetary implications The proposal requires human and financial resources for the purchase of data and services. Some of the staff requirements are expected to be met under the existing allocations of the Commission, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Russia’s recent military aggression against Ukraine and the ongoing armed conflict has fundamentally changed the security situation in Europe. As a result of the aggression, the European Union, and its eastern regions in particular, is facing a substantial inflow of persons. Secondly, the COVID-19 pandemic has lasted longer than could have been expected in 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the pandemic persist in all Member States, requiring prolonged public support for recovery in the most affected territories and economic sectors. This has put considerable pressure on Member States' budgets. While the flexibility and additional resources provided for the period 2014-2020 have helped Member States in their crisis response and recovery efforts, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus, notably the Omicron variant, as well as the general tightening of restrictions in the last quarter of 2021, have continued to have serious negative effects on Member States’ economies and societies and hampered a normal implementation of cohesion policy programmes and of programmes supported by the FEAD. The recent military aggression by Russia and the resulting migration flows have exacerbated these effects and risk further undermining economic recovery. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. CONTENT: the proposal aims to: - facilitate the use of cohesion policy and FEAD resources by Member States and regions to support measures to address migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by Russia; and - allow for a derogation from the normal co-financing rules currently applicable in order to allow for the necessary flexibility to mobilise existing investment resources to address the direct and indirect effects stemming from the unprecedented public health crisis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 in order to: - ensure that Member States and regions may continue to benefit from a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2021-2022 and this by way of notification to the Commission; - introduce arrangements for the budgetary execution of additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate to take account of annual ceilings for payments; - introduce additional flexibility between ERDF and ESF specifically for operations addressing the migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by Russia and introduce simplified reporting arrangements on participants with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 February 2022 (date of the start of the military aggression); - introduce flexibility for Member States to amend programmes supported by the FEAD and this by way of notification to the Commission and also with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 February 2022. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments and does not imply changes to the overall payment needs over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the previous uptake of the 100% co-financing rate in the 2020-2021 accounting year, the level of payment applications submitted in the second half of 2021, and the latest Member State payment forecasts for 2022, the budgetary impact of the application of the 100% co-financing rate for the 2021-2022 accounting year is estimated to represent a frontloading of payment needs of EUR 9 billion to 2022 and EUR 1 billion to 2023, compensated by a corresponding reduction of EUR 10 billion in 2024. However, in order to be able to comply with the payment ceilings in years 2022 and 2023, it is proposed to cap the total additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate at EUR 5 billion in 2022 and EUR 1 billion in 2023. The additional amounts will only be paid after all the payment applications are received for the accounting year 2021-2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has led to a massive influx of displaced persons from Ukraine into several Member States. This places renewed pressure on the financial resources of Member States to deal with urgent migration, border management and security needs. Taking into account the nature and dimension of the crisis, these unforeseen needs will persist beyond 2022. This invasion has given rise to increased needs in areas, such as migration and border management, directly covered by the Home Affairs Funds (2014-2020). The Commission considers it necessary to widen the scope of use of Home Affairs Funds as much as possible, by extending the period of eligibility and by unblocking access to unspent earmarked resources, thus avoiding the loss of unused funding following decommitment. This overall flexibility is necessary to ensure a comprehensive approach to migration management, based on mutual trust, solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States and EU institutions. CONTENT: the proposal aims to support Member States to address the consequences of the war in Ukraine, by facilitating access to unspent financial resources for the 2014-2020 programming period under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund insofar as it concerns the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, 2 as well as the Internal Security Fund insofar as it concerns the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. Specifically, the proposal aims to: - extend the implementation period of the Home Affairs Funds 2014-2020 by one year. This extension will enable Member States to urgently utilise remaining funds to help address the increased pressure on their border and migration management systems arising from the invasion in Ukraine; - unlock access to unspent earmarked resources under the AMIF 2014-2020 to enable Member States to better address the increased pressure on their asylum and migration management systems stemming from the invasion of Ukraine. This access will be provided by amending Regulation (EU) 516/2014 establishing the AMIF and laying down provisions for its use; - enable the use of External Assigned Revenue under the AMIF 2021-2027. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 aims to give Member States and other public or private donors the possibility, under the 2021-2027 programming period, to make additional financial contributions to asylum and migration management in the form of external assigned revenue. This external assigned revenue will constitute a dedicated contribution from Member States and other public or private donors to finance specific items of expenditure under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for 2021-2027."

Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As of 11 March 2022, over 310 000 refugees had entered the Republic of Moldova from Ukraine following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In just the first two weeks of the war, more than two million refugees – around 4% of Ukraine’s population – mainly fled westward from the encroaching Russian forces. Moldovan border management authorities are thus now facing the twin challenges of regulating the influx and subsequent outflow of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees, including monitoring the smuggling of weapons. Furthermore, some 12% of the territory of the country is not under the control of Moldovan authorities, including a large portion of Moldova’s border with Ukraine. On 14 March 2022, the Council adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Moldova as regards actions by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the territory of Moldova. On 17 March 2021, on the basis of a written procedure, delegations confirmed their agreement on the proposal for a Council Decision on the signature of the Status Agreement with Moldova. The Agreement was signed the same day, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The aim of the agreement is to allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to deploy border management teams from the permanent contingent to Moldova. The agreement regulates all aspects necessary for the deployment of the Border Management Teams from the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps in the Republic of Moldova, where the members of the teams may exercise executive powers. A status agreement will allow Frontex to assist Moldova in border management, by deploying teams capable of assisting the Moldovan authorities in tasks such as registration and border checks."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the Republic of Moldova have developed a close political and economic relationship over the years. The last Association Agenda for 2017-2019 has been extended over the period of one year (due to the pandemic last year), whilst a new document is under preparation, covering the 2021-2027 period. Moldova's economic ties with the EU are also well developed. The EU continues to be Moldova’s largest trading partner, accounting for 52% of its total trade in 2020. Moldova’s economy has been affected significantly by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the protracted political stalemate in the country after the Presidential elections in November 2020, as well as the recent energy crisis. The situation contributed to Moldova’s sizable financing gap, deteriorating external position, and growing fiscal needs. Following the election in July 2021, the new Moldovan government has demonstrated a strong commitment to further reforms, with an ambitious programme ‘Moldova in good times 2021-2025’, focusing on key policy areas including, among others, justice sector reforms, fight against corruption, good governance and the rule of law. With the renewed reform-commitment and strong political will, the authorities have significantly accelerated on reform implementation, which has also allowed Moldova to successfully complete the COVID-19 macro-financial assistance operation. In view of a worsening economic situation and outlook, Moldova requested a complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in November 2021. The proposed MFA would help Moldova cover part of its residual external financing needs, which are estimated at USD 480 million, in the context of the new IMF programme over the period of 2021-2025. Given that Moldova is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. CONTENT: the Union will provide macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 150 million available to Moldova, with a view to supporting Moldova's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. Of that maximum amount, up to EUR 120 million will be provided in the form of loans and up to EUR 30 million in the form of grants. The loans will have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Moreover, the assistance will contribute to covering Moldova's balance of payments needs as identified in the IMF programme. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in three instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2022; - the second instalment could be disbursed in early 2023; - the third tranche could follow later that year or in the first half of 2024, provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. It should be noted that a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance will be that Moldova respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. They Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments relating to MFA. Budgetary implications The financial programming of the EUR 150 million assistance over the 2022-2024 period allows for a grant component of EUR 30 million to be financed from the available budget on budget line 14 20 03 01 ‘Macro-financial assistance (MFA) – grants’'. For the loan component of EUR 120 million, the required provisioning at a rate of 9% of the External Action Guarantee will be programmed under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 10.8 million (budget line 14 02 01 70 ‘NDICI – Provisioning of the Common Provisioning Fund’)."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition . With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Brazil were successfully finalised on 31 October 2017 by the initialling of the agreements amending the two Agreements between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports, and for holders of ordinary passports. Both parties have agreed to adopt the new definition of 'short-stay', among other technical details, but all amendments are insignificant from the traveller's point of view. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports . The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay : the Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Brazil when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). An amendment has been made clarifying that a suspension of the visa waiver shall actually be lifted if the reasons that led to the suspension disappear. On this point, the amendment aligns the wording of the agreement with Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports with that of all other visa waiver agreements signed by the Union in 2015 and 2016. Entry into force : the Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the 6th month following the date on which the last Contracting Party notifies the other that the ratification procedures have been completed. To ensure legal certainty and enable travellers to comprehend the law and to comply with it, a sufficiently long transitional period is necessary. Once ratification of the Agreement has been completed, the six-month period will allow travellers to complete short stays that are still entirely calculated under the old definition, before entry into force of the new short-stay definition and its 180-day backward-looking reference period. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports remain unaffected by the Agreement, including the territorial scope. Territorial application : the provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. The Union has no power to amend visa waiver agreements that would bind the four countries that are associated with the implementation of the Schengen acquis, including the common visa policy. In order to ensure a harmonised approach and implementation of the provisions on the duration of authorised stay in the Schengen area, a joint declaration is included in the Agreement, stating the desirability for Brazil, on the one hand, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, on the other, to accordingly modify their existing bilateral visa waiver agreements."

PURPOSE: to set up a European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 2 and 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union enshrine the right to equality between women and men as one of the core values and tasks of the Union. The European pillar of social rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, includes among its principles equal treatment of women and men and the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Despite Directive 2006/54/EC, supplemented in 2014 by a Commission Recommendation on pay transparency, the effective implementation of the principle of equal pay remains problematic in practice in the EU. The gender pay gap in the EU remains at around 14%. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences on female workers make it even more urgent to address this issue. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for more action at EU level to improve the implementation of equal pay provisions. The Council has called on both the Member States and the Commission to act. Following the evaluation of the existing framework on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025 announced binding measures on pay transparency. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to address the persistent inadequacy in the application of the fundamental right to equal pay and to ensure that this right is respected throughout the EU, by setting standards for pay transparency to enable workers to assert their right to equal pay. Member States could provide for a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive. Same work and work of equal value The proposal requires Member States to establish tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of work in line with a set of objective criteria which include educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of the tasks involved. The availability of clear criteria at national level will help workers to establish a valid comparator and assess whether they are treated less favourably than the comparator performing the same work or work of equal value. Pay transparency The proposal: - requires employers to provide, prior to the job interview, information on the initial pay level or a corresponding range (based on objective and gender-neutral criteria) to be paid to the future worker in relation to a specific position or job. Employers would not have the right to ask applicants about their pay history in their former employment relationship; - requires employers to make available to workers a description of the gender-neutral criteria used to define their pay and career progression; - gives workers the right to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and on average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work or work of equal value; - requires employers with at least 250 workers to make publicly accessible certain information, such as the pay gap between female and male workers in their organisation. On the basis of the information provided, employees and their representatives would have the right to ask the employer for clarification of this information; - obliges the employers concerned to carry out a pay assessment in cooperation with employee representatives where the pay information indicates a gender pay gap of at least 5%, which the employer cannot justify on the basis of objective and gender-neutral factors. Better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination With regard to redress and enforcement, the proposal: - requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to enforce the rights and obligations under the Directive; - introduces the right for equality bodies and workers’ representatives or other legal entities to act on behalf or in support of a worker, and for them to bring collective claims to court; - obliges Member States to ensure that any worker who is a victim of sex discrimination in pay can obtain full compensation for the harm caused; - increases the burden of proof on the employer: the employer, not the worker, should prove the absence of discrimination in relation to pay; - provides that the limitation period for bringing a claim under the proposed Directive should be at least three years; - requires Member States to establish specific penalties for infringements of the equal pay rule, including minimum fines."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: all sectors of the economy need to contribute to achieving those emission reductions. Therefore, the ambition of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), established by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, should be adjusted to be in line with the economy-wide net greenhouse gas emissions reduction commitment for 2030. In order to address the structural imbalance between supply and demand of allowances in the market, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 of the European Parliament and of the Council established a market stability reserve (MSR) in 2018, which has been operational since 2019. The reserve functions by triggering adjustments to the annual volumes of allowances to be auctioned. In order to preserve a maximum degree of predictability, Decision (EU) 2015/1814 established clear rules for placing and releasing allowances in the reserve. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. As part of this package, this proposal aims to increase the environmental contribution of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). As the MSR Decision currently stands, the 24 % intake rate of the MSR and the minimum amount to be placed in the reserve of 200 million allowances will expire in 2023. As from 2024, the intake rate would become 12 %. 12 % intake rate would not be enough to ensure that the objectives of the MSR in terms of reducing the surplus and ensuring market resilience would still be fulfilled. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission seeks to ensure that the current parameters of the MSR (intake rate of 24 % and minimum amount to be placed in the reserve of 200 million allowances) are maintained beyond 2023 and until the end of Phase IV of the EU ETS on 31 December 2030 to ensure market predictability. The MSR intake rate would revert to 12 % after 2030. Monitoring and reporting The Commission will continue to monitor and evaluate the functioning of the EU ETS, including the MSR, in its annual Carbon Market Report. The initiative builds on the process based on integrated national energy and climate plans and the robust transparency framework for greenhouse gas emissions and other climate information. The Commission will use the information submitted and reported by Member States under the Governance Regulation as a basis for its regular assessment of progress. This includes information on greenhouse gas emissions, policies and measures, projections and adaptation."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out in the third countries listed in its Annex I on certain seed-producing crops are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, seed of certain cereal species produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022. On 29 January 2016, Bolivia submitted a request to the Commission to consider seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia as offering the same assurances as regards identity, health and quality as seed produced in the EU on the basis of official controls carried out by the competent authorities of that country. Following this request, the Commission assessed the relevant Bolivian legislation and carried out an audit of the Bolivian seed production and certification system. The Commission identified shortcomings and made recommendations to Bolivia. As Bolivia addressed these shortcomings by 30 November 2018, the Commission recognised that the Bolivian system in place offered the same assurance as the EU system. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to grant equivalence in respect of field inspections of seed producing crops of sorghum, maize and sunflower carried out in Bolivia and in respect of seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia and officially certified by its authorities. As Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022, it is proposed to extend by 7 years (until 31 December 2029) the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision, in order to avoid any risk of disruption of seed imports into the Union. The proposal will stimulate seed trade between Bolivia and the EU. Granting the EU equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU. It could also make it more attractive for EU-based companies to invest in the agricultural development of Bolivia given that the EU would become an export market."

The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive incorporates into EU law the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), (STCW Convention), which was the subject of a major revision at a Conference of the Parties to the STCW Convention held in Manila in 2010. Further amendments to the Convention were adopted in 2015 and 2016. As all Member States are Parties to the STCW Convention, the harmonisation of EU regulations on the training and certification of seafarers with the STCW Convention aims to ensure consistent implementation of their international commitments. Specifically, the proposal: - sets out the training rules and standards of competence to be met by candidate seafarers in order to obtain or revalidate a certificate enabling them to perform the duties for which the certificate of competency or proficiency is issued. Training for seafarers should cover proper theoretical and practical training so as to ensure that seafarers are qualified to meet security and safety standards and are able to respond to hazards and emergencies; - obliges Member States to adopt and enforce specific measures to prevent and penalise fraudulent practices related to certificates of competency or certificates of proficiency; - lays down criteria for the inspection of maritime training establishments, training programmes and courses; - contains provisions on minimum rest periods for watchkeeping personnel to improve maritime safety and the prevention of pollution at sea; - provides for measures to ensure communication between crew members of ships sailing in EU waters; - establishes common criteria for the recognition by the Member States of seafarers’ certificates issued by third countries, based on the training and certification requirements as agreed in the framework of the STCW Convention; - improves the effectiveness of the centralised mechanism for the recognition of seafarers’ certificates from third countries and enhances legal clarity with regard to the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by Member States. The proposal provides that a reassessment of third countries which provide a low number of seafarers to ships flying the flags of Member States should be performed at intervals of ten years."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: pursuant to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, which is an integral part of the UK Withdrawal Agreement, medicines placed on the market in Northern Ireland must be covered by a valid marketing authorisation issued by the Commission (EU-wide authorisations) or the United Kingdom (UK) in respect of Northern Ireland. These national authorisations should be in compliance with the obligations of the EU acquis for medicinal products. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021) for maintaining batch testing and manufacturing / logistics in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to ensure undisrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it still proves very difficult for certain operators currently based in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to adapt and move relevant regulatory compliance functions (namely, the marketing authorisation holder, quality control (batch) testing, the qualified persons responsible for batch testing pharmacovigilance) to Northern Ireland or the EU in respect of nationally authorised products, as required by the Protocol. Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down rules concerning medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products intended to be placed on the market in the Member States. In order to avoid shortages of medicinal products and to ensure a high level of public health protection, these Directives need to be amended to provide for derogations for medicinal products supplied to Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland from parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal provides for derogations from Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to ensure the long-term continuity of supply of generic and innovative medicines to Northern Ireland from the UK and to address the remaining supply problems in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. The proposal exceptionally allows the following: - the marketing authorisation holder and the manufacturing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - batch checks may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch controls and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland or Malta will be able to purchase and obtain medicinal products from a third country (parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing authorisation and without the need to repeat batch checks; This proposal allows exceptionally that: - a marketing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the manufacturing authorisation holder may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the batch testing may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch testing and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland, or Malta may purchase and obtain medicines from a third country (parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing import authorisation and without re-testing the products; - the competent authorities of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland may temporarily authorise the supply to patients in Northern Ireland of a medicinal product provided that (i) the medicinal product concerned has obtained a marketing authorisation issued by the competent authority of the United Kingdom for parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; and (ii) the medicinal product concerned is made available to patients or end-users only within the territory of Northern Ireland and is not made available in any Member State; - the UK should comply with EU legislation on the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products for human use when issuing marketing authorisations for Northern Ireland. Malta, Cyprus and Ireland will have certain derogations for a period of three years (until 31 December 2024). In these three countries, during this period, importers of medicinal products from the UK will not be required to hold manufacturing authorisations, nor will such medicinal products be required to undergo batch testing if such testing has already been carried out in the UK. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 as regards a derogation from certain obligations concerning investigational medicinal products made available in the United Kingdom with respect to Northern Ireland as well as in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for investigational medicinal products intended to be used in clinical trials in the Union. According to the Regulation, read in conjunction with the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol to the UK Withdrawal Agreement, the importation of investigational medicinal products from third countries into the Union or Northern Ireland is subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021), including for import requirements for investigational medicinal products, in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it is still proving very difficult for some operators currently based in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland to adapt as required by the Protocol. An interruption in the supply of investigational medicinal products would present a potential risk to the safety and well-being of participants in ongoing clinical trials and would hamper the establishment of new clinical trials in these Member States and Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to provide for exemptions for medicinal products distributed in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta that are used as investigational medicinal products in clinical trials in those countries. Specifically, the proposal provides that the importation of investigational medicinal products from other parts of the United Kingdom into Northern Ireland and, until 31 December 2024, into Cyprus, Ireland and Malta is not subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation, provided that the following conditions are met: - the investigational medicinal products have undergone certification of batch release either in the Union or in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to verify compliance with the requirements set out in Article 63(1); - the investigational medicinal products are only made available to clinical trial participants in the Member State into which the investigational medicinal products are imported or, if imported into Northern Ireland, are only made available to clinical trial participants in Northern Ireland. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to introduce exemptions from certain obligations relating to medicinal products for human use available in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland, as well as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the recent military aggression by Russia against Ukraine, the European Union and in particular its eastern regions are facing a massive influx of people. This poses an additional challenge for public budgets at a time when Member States’ economies are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and risks undermining the preparation of a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. Member States are already able to finance a broad range of investments to address migratory challenges under their operational programmes with support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), including from the additional resources made available as Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). The Commission has already taken steps to assist Member States in this regard, through its ‘Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe’ (CARE) initiative of 8 March 2022. Notwithstanding the room for manoeuvre offered by the CARE package, Member States face additional immediate budgetary pressures arising from the management of mass arrivals of people fleeing Ukraine. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. The Commission therefore considers it necessary, as a temporary and exceptional measure, to increase the amount of pre-financing paid under REACT-EU for all Member States. BACKGROUND: this proposal provides for exceptional and targeted changes to the 2014-2020 legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds and for the Fund for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in response to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the subsequent impact on the European Union and several of its eastern regions in particular. It is proposed to amend Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 223/2014 in order to provide for an increased percentage of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is necessary to respond to this unprecedented situation. In addition to the initial pre-financing, the Commission will pay 4% of the REACT-EU resources allocated to programmes for the year 2021 as additional initial pre-financing in 2022. For programmes in Member States which have had a level of arrivals of persons from Ukraine greater than 1% of their national population between 24 February 2022 and 23 March 2022, that percentage shall be increased to 34%. In order to monitor the use of this additional pre-financing, the final reports on the implementation of ERDF and ESF programmes benefiting from such pre-financing should include information on how the additional amounts received have been used to address the migration challenges linked to Russia's military aggression and have contributed to the recovery of the economy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal only concerns REACT-EU, which is financed by the European Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU. The additional initial pre-financing payments in 2022 will be financed from external assigned revenues. All amounts will be available as external assigned revenues, within the meaning of the Financial Regulation stemming from the Next GenerationEU borrowing operations. The amount paid as additional initial pre-financing will be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the operational programme is closed, such that the total amount of payments made under REACT-EU will remain unchanged with this proposal. Similarly, the total commitment appropriations under REACT-EU will not be modified."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is faced with potential threats to the security of gas supply, mainly linked to its dependence for primary energy from third countries. The escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine since February 2022 has led to unprecedented price increases. These price increases are likely to fundamentally change the incentives to fill storage facilities in the Union. In the current geopolitical context, further supply disruptions of gas can no longer be excluded. This could severely harm citizens and the economy of the Union, as the Union is still to a significant extent dependent on external gas supplies which can be affected by the conflict. It is therefore crucial that the EU acts in a coordinated manner to avoid potential risks resulting from a possible gas supply interruption. CONTENT: this proposal amends two existing regulations, Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and Regulation (EU) 715/2009 on conditions for access to natural gas transmission networks. It builds on the existing framework for gas security of supply and internal gas market rules, adding further measures needed to ensure security of supply of natural gas in the Union in the context of the severe energy crisis caused by recent changes of the geopolitical situation. The proposal aims notably at ensuring that storage capacities in the Union, which are crucial to ensure security of supply, do not remain unused, to ensure that storages can be shared across the Union, in a spirit of solidarity. Mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities The proposal seeks to ensure that a mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities will reinforce the security of supply ahead of the winter 2022/2023 and for the following winter periods. A new provision will require the Member States to ensure that the storage infrastructures in its territory are, in principle, filled up to at least 90% of their capacity at Member State level by 1 November each year, with intermediary targets for each Member State in February, May, July, and September. For 2022, the filling target is set at 80% of the capacity of all storage facilities located on the territory of the respective Member States. The Commission is mandated to ensure that the filling targets are met in case intermediate targets are missed. Certification of storage system operators A new mandatory certification of all storage system operators will avoid potential risks resulting from outside influence over critical storage infrastructure, meaning that non-certified operators will have to give up ownership or control of EU gas storage facilities. In addition, for a gas storage facility to close down its operations it would need to have an authorisation from the national regulator. Burden sharing mechanism The proposal introduced a burden sharing mechanism, as although not all Member States have storage facilities in their territories, all will benefit from having a guaranteed high filling level, in terms of the insurance value against security of supply risks and price dampening effects in winter. New filling obligations Competent authorities will continuously monitor the filling of the underground storage facilities in order to ensure that their national filling trajectories are met. This new provision also reinforces the role of the Gas Coordination Group, giving it an explicit mandate to monitor Member States' performance in the area of gas security of supply, and to develop best practices on that basis. Tariff rebate In order to incentivise the refilling of EU gas storage facilities, the Commission is proposing a 100% discount on capacity-based transmission tariffs at entry and exit points of storage facilities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (POPs Regulation) implements the Union's commitments under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, approved by Council Decision 2006/507/EC, and the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants, approved by Council Decision 2004/259/EC. All POP substances are recognised to have adverse, generally long-term effects upon living organisms . They persist for a very long time in the environment and in our bodies and can be transported unchanged to almost any remote point of the globe, far away from where they were produced or used. Management of POP waste, including its recycling where this is possible, should be carried out in an environmentally sound manner, with minimal impact on human health and the environment. It should also minimise the extent to which toxic substances are released into the environment, and thus contribute to the zero-pollution ambition by reducing their environmental and health impact. CONTENT: the proposal aims to implement, for the substances within its scope, the EU’s international obligations under the Stockholm Convention and, more specifically, those derived from the POPs Regulation. The proposed update brings Annexes IV and V of the Regulation into line with the Stockholm Convention and Annex I of the POPs Regulation by aligning them with the substances listed therein and by introducing concentration limits for these substances. Taking into account the amendments made to the Stockholm Convention on 15 May 2015 and in order to ensure that waste containing these substances is managed in accordance with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention, the Commission proposes to amend Annexes IV and V of Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 by including pentachlorophenol, dicofol and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts and PFOA-related compounds in the Annexes and indicating their corresponding concentration limits. It is also proposed to amend the concentration limits set out in Annex IV for the following substances to adapt their limit values to scientific and technical progress: tetrabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether, heptabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromocyclododecane, alkanes C10-C13, chloro (short-chain chlorinated paraffins), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF). Lastly, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dioxin-like PCBs) should be included in the existing group entry for Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) in Annexes IV and V of the POP Regulation. The proposal is consistent with the objective of ensuring an optimal balance with the Green Deal for Europe's ambitions to achieve toxic-free material cycles, increasing recycling and circularity and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a strong, open and competitive single market allows both European and foreign companies to compete on the basis of merit, provided that a level playing field in the market is guaranteed. In recent years, there have been cases where foreign subsidies have been found to have distorting effects on the EU's internal market, creating an uneven playing field. These foreign subsidies can take different forms, such as zero interest loans, unlimited state guarantees, tax exemptions or reductions for foreign investment or trade, or dedicated State funding. EU rules on competition, public procurement and trade defence instruments play an important role in ensuring a level playing field for companies operating in the single market. However, none of these tools apply to foreign subsidies that give their beneficiaries an unfair advantage when acquiring EU companies, participating in public procurement in the EU or doing other business in the EU. There are currently no specific EU rules to address the distorting effects that foreign subsidies can have on the internal market. It is therefore necessary to complement the existing EU instruments with a new instrument to effectively combat distortions in the internal market caused by foreign subsidies and to ensure a level playing field The legislative proposal aims to fill a regulatory gap in the Single Market. It is in line with the new Industrial Strategy for Europe presented by the Commission in March 2020 and follows the adoption of the White Paper on foreign subsidies in June 2020. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes rules and procedures for investigating foreign subsidies that distort the internal market and for remedying the distortions they cause. Such distortions may affect all economic activities, in particular in the case of mergers and public procurement procedures. Under the proposed Regulation, the Commission will have the power to investigate financial contributions granted by public authorities of a non-EU country which benefit companies engaging in an economic activity in the EU and redress their distortive effects, as relevant. In this context, the Regulation proposes the introduction of three tools: - Component 1: a notification-based tool to investigate concentrations involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the EU turnover of the company to be acquired (or of at least one of the merging parties) is EUR 500 million or more and the foreign financial contribution is at least EUR 50 million; - Component 2: a notification-based tool to investigate bids in public procurements involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the estimated value of the procurement is EUR 250 million or more; and - Component 3: a tool to investigate all other market situations and smaller concentrations and public procurement procedures, which the Commission can start on its own initiative (ex-officio) and may request ad-hoc notifications. Ex officio examination of subsidies . The proposal provides that the Commission could, on its own initiative, examine information from any source concerning alleged distortive foreign subsidies, either as a preliminary examination or as a full investigation. It would be able to conduct on-site inspections in the EU and elsewhere. The Commission should take into account the positive effects of the foreign subsidy on the development of the subsidised economic activity in question. It should balance these positive effects against the negative effects of a foreign subsidy in terms of distortion in the internal market. If the negative effects outweigh the positive effects, the Commission could impose remedial measures or accept undertakings from the companies concerned to remedy the distortions. The proposal foresees a range of structural or behavioural remedies, such as divestment of certain assets or prohibition of a certain market behaviour. The Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments for procedural infringements, such as the supply of incorrect or incomplete information in an investigation, and for non-compliance with a Commission decision imposing redressive, interim measures or commitments. Concentration and bids in public procurement As regards mergers and public procurement, the proposal involves a system of ex ante notification of the largest and potentially most distortive case. It sets out the conditions under which a foreign subsidy is considered to distort the internal market. The Commission would have the power, upon notification, to examine information on foreign financial contributions in the context of a proposed merger. Companies should not be allowed to implement the concentration before the conclusion of the Commission's review. The proposal specifies when a concentration should be suspended and sets out the relevant time limits. The proposed Regulation provides that if an undertaking fails to comply with the obligation to notify a subsidised concentration or a financial contribution in the context of public procurement contracts meeting the thresholds, the Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments. Fines and periodic penalty payments could also be imposed in the case of notifications containing incorrect information or in the case of failure to notify. In case of notified transactions, the Commission should also have the power to prohibit the subsidised acquisition or the award of the public procurement contract to the subsidised bidder. Budgetary impact The total administrative expenditure for the implementation of the proposal in 2021-2027 will thus amount to EUR 90.340 million, part of which will be financed from the single market programme."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2021/953, the epidemiological situation with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved considerably. On the one hand, by 31 January 2022, more than 80% of the adult population in the Union had completed their primary vaccination cycle, and more than 50% have received a booster dose, despite significant differences between Member States. Increasing vaccine uptake remains a crucial objective in the fight against the pandemic, given the protection against hospitalisation and severe disease afforded by vaccination, and thus plays an important role in ensuring that restrictions to the free movement of persons can be lifted. After a peak in Omicron cases, a high proportion of the population is expected to enjoy, at least for a certain period, protection from COVID-19 either due to vaccination or prior infection, or both. However, it is not possible to predict the impact of a possible increase in infections in the second half of 2022. In addition, the possibility of a worsening of the pandemic situation because of the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern cannot be ruled out. In view of the above, it cannot be excluded that Member States continue to require Union citizens exercising their right to free movement to present proof of COVID-19 vaccination, test or recovery beyond 30 June 2022, that is, the date when Regulation (EU) 2021/953 is currently set to expire. It is important to ensure that Union citizens and their family members are not deprived of the possibility to make use of their EU Digital COVID Certificates, which are an effective, secure and privacy-preserving way of proving one’s COVID-19 status, in the event that certain restrictions to free movement based on public health are still in place after 30 June 2022. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission is proposing to extend, by 12 months (until 30 June 2023), the application of Regulation (EU) 2021/953, which lays down a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable COVID-19 vaccination, test and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) for the purpose of facilitating the holders’ exercise of their right to free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic. This should allow EU citizens and their family members exercising their right to free movement to continue demonstrating that they fulfil public health requirements imposed, in compliance with EU law, by the Member State of destination. In addition to the extension of the EU Digital COVID Certificate Regulation until June 2023, the Commission also proposes some limited amendments to Regulation (EU) 2021/953 such as: - a broadening of the definition of SARS-CoV-2 tests that rely on the detection of viral proteins (antigens) to include antigenic assays performed in a laboratory setting and not only rapid antigen tests that give results in less than 30 minutes; - an explicit clarification that vaccination certificates are to contain the number of doses administered to the holder, regardless of the Member State in which they have been administered, to make sure that the overall number actually administered is accurately reflected; - a clarification that EU Digital COVID Certificates may also be issued to persons participating in clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, and that such certificates may be accepted by other Member States in order to waive restrictions to free movement; - an extension by 12 months of the period of application set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/953, as well as of the power to adopt delegated acts with a view to adapting the information included in the vaccination certificate. The proposal notes that the domestic use of EU Digital COVID Certificates remains a matter for Member States to decide. The EU legislation on the EU Digital COVID Certificate neither prescribes nor prohibits the domestic use of EU Digital COVID Certificate (such as for access to events or restaurants). At the same time, where a Member State establishes a system of COVID-19 certificate for domestic purposes, it should continue to ensure that the EU Digital COVID Certificate is also fully accepted for those purposes. Beyond that, the Commission also encourages Member States to align their domestic validity periods with the validity period set at EU level for the purpose of travel."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: under the Schengen acquis, third country nationals lawfully residing in the Union and third country nationals who have legally entered the territory of a Member State may move freely within the territories of all other Member States during a period of 90 days in any 180-day period. On 14 June 2021, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EU) 2021/953 establishing the EU Digital COVID Certificate. That Regulation sets out a common framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable certificates for COVID-19 vaccination, test or recovery certificates to facilitate free movement of EU citizens and their family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regulation (EU) 2021/953 is accompanied by Regulation (EU) 2021/954 of the European Parliament and of the Council, which extends the EU Digital COVID Certificate framework to third-country nationals who are legally staying or residing in a Member State’s territory and who are entitled to travel to other Member States in accordance with Union law. Regulations (EU) 2021/953 and (EU) 2021/954 are due to expire on 30 June 2022. Nevertheless, the pandemic is still on-going and the recent outbreak of the ‘Omicron’ variant of concern continues to negatively impact travel within the Union. Consequently, the EU Digital COVID Certificate remains relevant and it is necessary to allow for its continued use. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission is proposing to extend, by 12 months (until 30 June 2023), the application of Regulation (EU) 2021/954, which lays down a framework for the issuance, verification and acceptance of interoperable COVID-19 vaccination, test and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) to certain categories of third country nationals lawfully residing or staying in the Union. The proposed Regulation should not be understood as facilitating or encouraging the adoption of travel restrictions in response to the pandemic. In addition, any need for verification of certificates established by Regulation (EU) 2021/953 should not be considered to justify the temporary reintroduction of controls at internal borders. This proposal complements the proposal to extend the period of application of Regulation (EU) 2021/953 on a framework for the issue, verification and acceptance of interoperable covid-19 vaccination, testing and recovery certificates (EU Digital COVID Certificate) in order to facilitate free movement during the COVID-19 pandemic."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products entered into force on 28 January 2022. Holders of marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products authorised under Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use, are not in a position to comply with the requirements set out in Articles 10 to 16 of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 with effect from 28 January 2022. Therefore, it is necessary to take urgent measures to address the concerns raised by Member States' competent authorities and stakeholders about the practical application of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 in order to remove any legal uncertainty and to avoid possible disruptions in the supply of veterinary medicines. CONTENT: the proposal provides for transitional rules in the proposal allow marketing authorisation holders to continue to place veterinary medicinal products complying with the packaging and labelling requirements of Directive 2001/82/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 on the market until 29 January 2027, even if they do not comply with the relevant requirements of Regulation 2019/6."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression by Russia against Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has seriously weakened Ukraine's ability to trade with the rest of the world, also due to the destruction of production capacities and the unavailability of many means of transport because of the closure of access to the Black Sea. In order to mitigate the negative economic impact of the aggression, the development of closer economic relations between the EU and Ukraine must be accelerated in order to provide rapid support to the Ukrainian authorities and people in these exceptional circumstances. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to stimulate trade flows and to grant concessions in the form of trade liberalisation measures for all products, in line with the acceleration of the elimination of customs duties on trade between the EU and Ukraine. CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces trade liberalisation measures in the form of the following three measures, which should apply for one year: - temporary suspension of all outstanding tariffs under Title IV of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine establishing a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA). This concerns three categories of products: (i) industrial products subject to duty phase out by the end of 2022; (ii) fruits and vegetables subject to the entry-price system; (iii) agricultural products and processed agricultural products subject to tariff-rate quotas; - temporary non-collection of anti-dumping duties on imports originating in Ukraine as of the date of entry into force of this Regulation; and - temporary suspension of the application of the common rules for imports (safeguard) with respect of imports originating in Ukraine. The trade-liberalising measures provided for under the present proposal for a Regulation are taken in observance of the commitment in Article 2 of the Association Agreement which enshrines as an essential element of the Agreement the promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence. These measures would be conditional upon respect for the same basic principles set out in Article 2, including those providing that the respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law constitute essential elements of that Agreement. Normal safeguard procedures would apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: based on an estimation according to the level of imports from Ukraine in 2021, the EU will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to less than EUR 31 million annually. The loss of anti-dumping duties is estimated at EUR 34.6 million. This figure is very likely to be significantly lower as the level of imports from Ukraine has been affected by the conflict. Therefore, the impact on the EU’s own resources will be very limited."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: on 24 February 2022, Russia launched a military aggression against Ukraine. There are reasonable grounds to believe that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been and are being committed in Ukraine. Given the seriousness of the situation, the EU should urgently take all necessary measures to ensure that those who committed these crimes in Ukraine are held accountable. As the European Union's platform for judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Eurojust provides support to national authorities investigating and prosecuting serious crime within its competence. Among others, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are crimes that fall within the competence of Eurojust. National authorities are currently collecting evidence of international crimes allegedly committed in Ukraine. Due to the ongoing hostilities, the evidence cannot be safely stored in Ukraine, which requires that a back-up/storage location be urgently found by the Union. Therefore, in order to coordinate the ongoing efforts of Member States to collect evidence, there is a need for the rapid establishment of a central storage system, where evidence collected by EU agencies and bodies as well as national and international authorities or third parties such as civil society organisations can be stored. In order to carry out its tasks, Eurojust has set up a Case Management System, which contains non-personal data and personal data as referred to in Annex II of the Eurojust Regulation. Recent events related to the Russian aggression against Ukraine have demonstrated the urgent need to go beyond the existing Eurojust case management system. Indeed, the current data processing architecture within Eurojust does not allow Eurojust to collect, store and analyse evidence on major international crimes, including those suspected to be committed in Ukraine. CONTENT: the proposal aims to improve Eurojust's ability to achieve its objectives as set out in the Eurojust Regulation by establishing an updated technical solution within Eurojust to assist Member States' authorities in dealing with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. To this end, the proposal aims to enable Eurojust to collect, store, analyse and exchange evidence relating to major international crimes by setting up an automated data management and storage facility outside the case management system. This information and evidence (physical and electronic) could be used both for criminal cases before national courts and for prosecutions by the International Criminal Court or any other court or mechanism established for this purpose. However, the proposal does not aim to introduce any obligation on national authorities to share such information and evidence. In view of the sensitive nature of the personal data involved, their processing, including collection, preservation, analysis and exchange, must comply with the highest standards of data protection and cyber security. The proposal also aims to extend the categories of data that Eurojust can legally process to videos and audio recordings as well as satellite images and any relevant photographs. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal would have an impact on Eurojust’s budget and its staff needs. It is estimated that further EUR 15.705 million would be needed for the period 2022-2027 to allow Eurojust to perform the tasks provided for by this proposal. This includes the costs for the setting up and management of the automated data management and storage facility (approximately EUR 500 000 per year) and for the necessary human resources to handle it."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite navigation systems and related applications between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United States of America, of the other part, was signed in 2004. It entered into force on 12 December 2011 for an initial period of ten years and expires on 12 December 2021. Both Parties have confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for a further period of five years, without any amendment to the Agreement. The Galileo and GPS systems are under further development and evolving. Continued cooperation between the two systems is necessary for a number of reasons, including to ensure compatibility and interoperability. Moreover, the United States is a privileged satellite navigation partner of the Union. It is in the interest of the EU to renew this Agreement in order to continue to further engage in satellite navigation cooperation with the U.S. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal for a further period of five years of the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS satellite navigation systems and related applications between the United States of America, on the one hand, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other. The Agreement’s objective is to provide a framework for cooperation between the Parties in the promotion, provision and use of civil GPS and Galileo navigation and timing signals and services, value-added services, augmentations, and global navigation and timing goods. Moreover, the Parties intend to work together, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, as provided herein, to promote and facilitate the use of these signals, services, and equipment for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific uses, consistent with and in furtherance of mutual security interests. It should be noted that this proposed renewal of the Agreement (i) does not foresee conferring Galileo ownership or decision-making rights to the U.S; (ii) does not give the U.S. the right to participate in the EU GNSS-related Programme Committees or Working Groups; (iii) does not allow the U.S. to participate in Galileo PRS (Public Regulated Service) relevant fora, working groups or discussions."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Mauritania and the European Community entered into force on 8 August 2008 for a period of six years. The agreement is renewable by tacit agreement and is therefore still in force. A previous four-year protocol for the implementation of the FPA (2015-2019) was extended twice, each time for a period of one year. It expires on 15 November 2021. In 2018, the Commission carried out an ex-post evaluation of the 2015-2019 FPA Protocol, as well as an ex-ante evaluation of a possible renewal of the FPA Protocol. The evaluation concluded that the EU fishing sector has a strong interest in operating in Gabon and that a renewal of the protocol would be in the interest of both parties. In addition, the renewal of the protocol would contribute to strengthening monitoring, control and surveillance, as well as improving the governance of fisheries activities in the region. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Mauritania with a view to concluding, on behalf of the European Union, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Implementing Protocol. Following these negotiations, an agreement and a protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 28 July 2021. The new Agreement covers a period of six years from the date of provisional application, that being the date on which it is signed by both parties. The new Implementing Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of provisional application and contains a clause providing for a review during its second year of application. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to authorise the conclusion of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania and the Protocol implementing that Agreement. Objectives The conclusion of the Agreement and its implementing Protocol will make it possible to continue and strengthen the strategic partnership in the fisheries sector between the European Union and Mauritania. The Agreement and the Protocol will also contribute to: - better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial (sectoral) support for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the fisheries comprehensive plan, the monitoring and combating of illegal fishing and support for the small-scale fisheries sector; - the sustainable exploitation by Mauritania of its marine resources, as well as Mauritania's fisheries economy, by promoting the growth of fisheries-related economic activities and the establishment of decent working conditions. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for the same fishing opportunities as the current Protocol during the first 2 years of application, except for a marginal adjustment of the reference tonnage for the two types of tuna vessel. Specifically, it covers the following categories: - vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 15 vessels; - black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 4 vessels; - pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - tuna seiners: 14 000 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 29 vessels; - pole-and-line tuna vessels and tuna longliners: 7 000 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - pelagic freezer trawlers: 247 500 tonnes and 19 vessels; - non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from the volume under category 6, if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution For the first 2 years of application of the Protocol, the annual financial contribution for access to Mauritanian waters and fishery resources in those waters is a maximum of EUR 57 500 000. This amount will be reviewed before the third year of application of the Protocol. The financial contribution to support the development of Mauritania’s sectoral fisheries policy is maintained at the overall level of the current Protocol, i.e. EUR 16 500 000 for the entire duration of the Protocol, but is spread over a period of 5 years, taking into account the rate of uptake of the funds and amounts that remain available under the current Protocol."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council established a system for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Union, in order to promote reductions of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient manner (EU ETS). Aviation activities were included in the EU emissions trading system by Directive 2008/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. Considering current and projected emissions from the aviation sector, and in the context of an enhanced climate ambition of the EU for 2030, the climate contribution needs to be significantly strengthened, also with a view to allow for the necessary contribution to the EU climate neutrality by 2050. CONTENT: under this proposal, the Commission introduces amendments to the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) legislation in relation to its application to aviation to ensure that: - aviation contributes to the 2030 emissions reduction target in accordance with the European Green Deal; - the EU ETS is amended as appropriate in respect of the ICAO’s Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation; and - allocation of emission allowances in respect of aviation is revised to increase auctioning. The proposal makes amendments to Directive 2003/87/EC in order to: - consolidate the total quantity of allowances for aviation at the level of allocation/auctioning for intra-European flights and departing flights from EEA airports to Switzerland and the UK. The allocation for year 2024 will be based on the total allocation to active aircraft operators in 2023. The total number of aviation allowances in the ETS will be capped at current levels and be reduced annually by 4.2% (linear reduction factor). The number of free allowances allocated to aircraft operators will be reduced progressively, with the aim of stopping free allocation to aviation by the end of 2026; - include a time-limited derogation from the EU ETS for emissions from flights between an aerodrome located in an outermost region of a Member State and an aerodrome located in the same Member State; - allows delegated acts to be adopted to supplement this Directive concerning the detailed arrangements for the auctioning by Member States of aviation allowances should include the modalities for the transfer of a share of revenues to the Union budget; - delete the provisions on free allocation rules to aircraft operators are no longer needed after the transition to full auctioning; - allow the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to apply to emissions from EU-based airlines for flights to and from countries outside the EEA, Switzerland and the UK. When emissions from flights outside the EEA reach levels higher than those in 2019, they will have to be offset by corresponding carbon offsets; - provide for EU-based airlines to use appropriate international credits for compliance for flights to or from third countries that are applying CORSIA; - ensure that fights to and from most Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States not implementing CORSIA would be exempt from EU ETS or CORSIA obligations without end date for the exemption. In parallel to these amendments to the EU ETS Directive, a separate proposal is being made to implement Member State notification to EU-based airlines of zero CORSIA offsetting for the year 2021. The separate proposal relates to CORSIA-related aspects that should be in place by November 2022, for notification of zero additional offsetting to take place by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2003/87/EC established an EU emissions trading system (EU ETS). It is aimed at tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a cost-effective and economically efficient way. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy.

This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. As part of this package, this proposal introduces an amendment to aviation rules in the Emissions Trading System of the European Union (EU ETS) to implement Member States’ notification to EU-based airlines of the offsetting for the year 2021 under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). CONTENT: with this proposal decision, the Commission seeks to phase out free emission allowances for aviation and align with the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in a way that is consistent with the EU’s 2030 climate objectives. The EU ETS Directive would thus allow the CORSIA scheme to be applied to emissions from EU-based airlines for flights to and from countries outside the EEA. The objective is to implement this notification in a manner that minimises the administrative burden of national authorities and airline operators, and provides legal certainty as regards CORSIA offsetting by airlines based in Member States. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aviation CO2 emissions in the EU ETS have decreased by 64% in 2020 compared to 2019. Aviation emissions are unlikely to exceed their 2019 levels in 2021. Therefore, the additional compensation for aircraft operators is expected to be zero for the year 2021. However, the proposed decision provides that Member States should implement the CORSIA scheme by notifying aircraft operators based in those Member States of their compensation for the year 2021 by 30 November 2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU put in place a regulatory framework to achieve the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 40% as endorsed by the European Council in 2014, before the entry into force of the Paris Agreement. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding.

CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to National targets and flexibilities The proposal updates the framework under which the Commission will set the new Member States’ annual emission levels in the years 2023–2030 A review will be carried out in 2025 with a view to adjusting the annual emission allocations for the years of 2026 to 2030 in order to ensure that they are neither too lenient nor too stringent. The proposal sets national ESR targets based mainly on GDP per capita, in order to ensure fairness and cost effectiveness in effort distribution, while enabling though its flexibilities a cost-efficient achievement of such targets. Member States can decide to opt-out. This reserve could be triggered only once the requirements of the Climate Law are fulfilled, for the purpose of national compliance with ESR targets by transferring any unused LULUCF credits. They may use a limited a limited amount of credit generated under the LULUCF legislation for compliance in the ESR. The Commission also proposes a new voluntary reserve, the additional reserve, to help Member States reaching their individual targets, allowing them to use non used net removals generated in the period 2026-2030, subject to the condition that the Union 55% emission reduction target is reached in 2030 with a maximum contribution of net removals set at 225 MtCO2Eq, as required by the European Climate Law. Monitoring and reporting The proposal continues the Effort Sharing Regulation with the same monitoring and reporting obligations for Member States and management tasks for the Commission. The Commission will continue to be supported by the European Environment Agency in monitoring Member States’ progress in meeting their obligations under the proposal. Budgetary implications The increase in the ESR targets will require additional measures at national level and Member States will need to revise and implement more stringent climate action strategies. Therefore, there is a need for capacity building support measures to be implemented throughout five years (2023-2027) allowing Member States to adjust to a more demanding framework. The total estimated cost of the support measures is EUR 1 750 000."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the initial regulatory framework for the land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) sector, as laid down in Regulation (EU) 2018/841, was adopted in 2018 and covers CO2 emissions and removals and greenhouse gas emissions of CH4 and N2O resulting from the management of land, forests and biomass during the period from 2021 to 2030. It contributes to the previous Union’s emission reduction target of at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, by ensuring that the sum of total emissions does not exceed the sum of total removals generated by the sector after the application of the accounting rules and of the flexibility with the “effort sharing” (or ESR) sector set out by Regulation (EU) 2018/842. The LULUCF Regulation primarily addresses Member States by establishing a minimum level of climate mitigation performance in the LULUCF sector; it does not set any reporting or compliance requirements for individual land managers. Under the current LULUCF rules, the minimum amount of removals that the LULUCF sector should provide at the EU level in 2030 is around -225 MtCO2eq. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution. The ‘Fit for 55’ package, the Next Generation EU and the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027 will help to achieve the twin green and digital transitions that Europe is aiming for. As part of this package, this proposal aims to make the LULUCF Regulation fit for reaching at least 55% net greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2030 compared to 1990, in line with the 2030 Climate Target Plan, as a staging post to achieving climate neutrality by 2050. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to amend the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation to provide stronger incentives for Member States to increase and enhance their natural carbon sinks, in line with EU climate law. The proposed amendment introduces only minor and non-substantive changes to the LULUCF regulatory framework for the first compliance period, i.e. from 2021 to 2025. In contrast, new targets for increased net carbon removals are foreseen for the period 2026-2030. To this end, the proposal: - sets out the overall Union target of net greenhouse gas removals in the LULUCF sector to 310 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2030; - reinforces the obligation for Member States to submit integrated mitigation plans for the land sector and enhances the monitoring, reporting and verification of emissions and removals using digital technologies; - aligns the objectives with related policy initiatives of biodiversity and bioenergy; - determines the Union target of climate neutrality for 2035 in the land sector (which combines the LULUCF sector and the non-CO2 agricultural sector); - commits the Commission to make proposals for national contributions to the 2035 target by 2025. Commitments to climate neutrality in 2035 From 2031 onwards , the LULUCF sector will include the non-CO2 emissions from agriculture sector and the amended Regulation will aim towards the objective to achieve climate neutrality in the Union-wide greenhouse gas emissions and removals in the combined sectors at the latest by 2035; reducing emissions to net zero by that date and generating negative emissions thereafter. The Member States are obliged to contribute to reach the collective target and need to present how they intend to achieve this objective in their updated integrated national energy and climate plans by June 2024. In view of the submitted plans, the Commission will propose, by the end of 2025, individual Member State targets and EU-wide measures for the post-2030 period. From 2036 onwards , the combined sector will need to generate further carbon removals to balance remaining emissions in other sectors, based on a robust carbon removal certification system. This policy framework could start to progressively combine the land sector with other sectors (beyond agriculture) that have exhausted their emissions reduction possibilities, or that have achieved for instance over 90% emission reductions. Thus, an incentive to steadily increase carbon removals in the combined sectors for period up to 2050 would be preserved. Flexibility rules The current LULUCF Regulation already provides Member States with several flexibility and trading options to exclude extreme emissions due to natural disturbances, such as forest fires, or unforeseen variations in harvesting rates. The proposal adapts those flexibility rules for the period from 2026 to 2030 and improves them, with a view to offering higher compensation in duly justified cases."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: transport is the only sector where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been on the rise. The GHG emissions from road transport are no exception. They represent almost 20% of total EU GHG emissions and have significantly increased since 1990. Air quality continues to be impacted by traffic and congestion, leading to increasing number of cities introducing low and zero-emission zones restricting local access for vehicles with internal combustion engines and to certain Member States announcing the phase-out of sales of internal combustion engine cars. The European Green Deal launched a new growth strategy for the EU that aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The ‘European Climate Law’ has made the EU's climate neutrality target by 2050 legally binding. The Commission has presented a complementary and interconnected set of proposals as part of the 2030 Climate and Energy ‘Fit for 55’ package to achieve the greenhouse gas emission reduction target of at least 55% compared to 1990. This ‘Fit for 55’ legislative package is the most comprehensive building block in the efforts to implement the ambitious new 2030 climate target, and all economic sectors and policies will need to make their contribution, including road transport. CONTENT: with this proposal, the Commission aims to contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU to achieve the updated target for 2030 and climate neutrality by 2050 by setting strengthened CO2 emission performance standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. The proposal should ensure that CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles are reduced, provide benefits to consumers in term of air quality and energy savings, and strengthen the technological leadership of the EU automotive value chain. Additional co-benefits are expected to be increased energy efficiency and energy security. A combination of measures is required to tackle rising emissions in road transport to complement emissions trading. Stronger CO2 emissions standards for cars and vans will accelerate the transition to zero-emission mobility. Under the proposal, average emissions of new cars should be reduced by 55% from 2030 and 100% from 2035 compared to 2021 levels. For new vans, the net reduction targets would be 50% and 100% respectively. To ensure that drivers are able to charge or fuel their vehicles at a reliable network across Europe, the revised Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation will require Member States to expand charging capacity in line with zero-emission car sales, and to install charging and fuelling points at regular intervals on major highways: every 60 kilometres for electric charging and every 150 kilometres for hydrogen refuelling. In addition, the proposal: - introduces derogations for certain manufacturers responsible for between 1 000 and 10 000 new passenger cars or between 1 000 and 22 000 new light commercial vehicles in a calendar year to apply for a derogation from the specific emission targets is removed from 2030 onwards. Manufacturers responsible for less than 1 000 new vehicle registrations per calendar year continue to be exempt; - sets out the obligation for the Commission to report on the progress towards zero-emission road mobility and assess the need for possible additional measures to facilitate the transition; - amends the Annexes with a view to: (i) adjusting the formulae for calculating the EU fleet-wide targets for 2030 and setting the formulae for 2035 as well as the annual specific emission targets for each manufacturer and removing the application of the zero- and low-emission vehicle (ZLEV) factor from 2030 onwards and; (ii) adjusting the formulae for determining the slope values required for calculating the annual specific emission targets. This adjustment is made in order to ensure a fair distribution of the reduction burden between manufacturers of lighter light commercial vehicles and those manufacturing heavier vehicles of that category."
