PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union using the procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council for the duration of the multiannual financial framework from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013. It was established to enable the Union to show solidarity towards workers who lost their jobs as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation. After analysing the risks, the European Commission concluded that this proposal was necessary to ensure an effective response from the EGF and to show solidarity with workers made redundant in the Union as a result of a withdrawal from the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement. CONTENT: the proposed contingency Regulation should amend Regulation (EU) No 1309/2013 in order to specify that redundancies resulting from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement fall within the scope of the EGF. Such a withdrawal would represent a major change in the EU's trade relations and the structure of the internal market and would therefore probably have significant repercussions on business models, growth and employment. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union and should apply from the date following that on which the Treaties cease to apply in the United Kingdom. However, it should not apply if a withdrawal agreement concluded with the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 50(2) TEU has entered into force by that date."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: this Council draft is part of the Union preparedness and contingency plan to mitigate the most significant disruptions of a withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without a withdrawal agreement. The United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom are participating in a number of Union programmes or actions on the basis of the United Kingdom’s membership in the Union. The participation takes place on the basis of agreements with the United Kingdom or persons or entities established in the United Kingdom or decisions in favour of the United Kingdom or persons or entities established in the United Kingdom which constitute legal commitments. In case of a withdrawal without a withdrawal agreement, it would be beneficial both for the Union and its Member States and for the United Kingdom, and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom, to provide for the eligibility in 2020 of the United Kingdom and beneficiaries established in the United Kingdom to receive Union funds and for the participation of the United Kingdom in the financing of the budget for 2020. It would also be beneficial if the legal commitments signed and adopted before the date of withdrawal, or in 2019 in application of Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197, could continue to be executed throughout 2020. CONTENT: the draft Council defines the conditions under which the United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom may continue to be eligible in 2020 with regard to agreements signed with them and decisions adopted with regard to them until the date of withdrawal or, where applicable, in 2019 pursuant to the contingency Regulation (Council Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197). The application of the proposed Regulation is subject to the following conditions: - the United Kingdom has confirmed the commitment in writing to the Commission to continue to pay a contribution calculated on the basis of the estimated own resources from the United Kingdom as set out in the draft budget for 2020 and adjusted to take into account the total amount of payment appropriations set out in the adopted budget for 2020; - a first instalment has been paid by the United Kingdom; - the United Kingdom has confirmed the commitment in writing to the Commission to allow audits and controls in full by the Union in compliance with the applicable rules. As long as the conditions for eligibility of the United Kingdom, and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom continue to be fulfilled, their eligibility should be ensured in 2020 for the purposes of conditions set in calls, tenders, contests or any other procedure which may lead to financing from the Union’s budget, with the exception of specific cases relating to security and the loss of the United Kingdom’s status as a member of the European Investment Bank, and to provide Union funding to them. Such Union funding should be limited to eligible expenditure incurred in 2020, except for public procurement contracts signed before the end of 2020 in application of Title VII of the Financial Regulation, which continue to be implemented in accordance with their terms, and except for the United Kingdom agricultural direct payment scheme for the claim year 2020, which should be excluded from eligibility. The draft regulation also provides for: - the continued eligibility of the United Kingdom and persons and entities established in the United Kingdom provided that the United Kingdom continues to pay the contribution for 2020 and, where applicable, for 2019 under Regulation (EU, Euratom) 2019/1197 and that controls and audits can be carried out effectively; - the continuation, in 2020, of the eligibility of actions under which Member States or persons or entities established in Member States receive funds from the Union and which are related to the United Kingdom. As it lays down measures for the implementation and financing of the Union's budget for 2020, the proposed Regulation should only concern eligibility for the 2020 financial year."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to prepare for the possibility that the United Kingdom could withdraw from the Union without an agreement on 30 March 2019, Regulation (EU) 2019/501 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EU) 2019/502 of the European Parliament and of the Council were adopted to ensure basic road freight and road passenger and basic air connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom. Regulation (EU) 2019/501 and Regulation (EU) 2019/502 shall cease to apply on 31 December 2019 and 30 March 2020 respectively. Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. In order to address the impact of the new timeline for the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the Union, the period of application of those Regulations should be extended, taking into account the core principles underlying contingency measures and their originally intended periods of application. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the period of validity of Regulations (EU) 2019/501 and (EU) 2019/502 by seven months, which corresponds to the duration of the extension of the period referred to in Article 50(3) of the TEU. Therefore, it is proposed that Regulation (EU) 2019/501 should cease to apply on 31 July 2020 rather than on 31 December 2019. In addition, in order to ensure that the option provided for in Article 2(3)(d) of Regulation (EU) 2019/501 is available for a meaning period of the same order as that initially provided for, it is necessary to define the period during which cabotage services in the field of road passenger transport may be provided in the border region of Ireland as a six-month period starting from the date of application of that Regulation. This rule should replace the current reference to the date of cessation of application of 30 September 2019. As regards Regulation (EU) 2019/502, the proposal sets 24 October 2020, the end of IATA's 2020 summer season, as the date of cessation of its application. The 12-month period of application initially envisaged would thus be preserved."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom has decided to leave the European Union, invoking the procedure set out in Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU). Following a request from the United Kingdom, the European Council agreed on 11 April 2019 to further extend the deadline provided for in Article 50(3) of the TEU until 31 October 2019. Unless the United Kingdom ratifies the withdrawal agreement by 31 October 2019 or requests a third extension and it is adopted unanimously by the European Council, the United Kingdom will leave the Union without agreement and become a third country on 1 November 2019. The EUSF was created in 2002 to support EU Member States and accession countries in situations of major disasters caused by natural events such as floods, storms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, forest fires or drought. The Fund can be mobilised upon an application from the concerned country if the disaster event has a dimension justifying intervention at European level. While it will be a singular event, its disruptive effects and the burden thereof on public finances, directly imputable to the event of a withdrawal without an agreement, could constitute a major disaster and therefore the activation of the “solidarity principle”, which is the core of the EUSF, would be justified in order to mitigate those effects. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 establishing the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in order to extend its scope to certain types of additional public expenditure caused by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union without agreement. Scope and eligibility Under the amending Regulation, the notion of 'major disasters' would cover natural disasters as well as situations where serious financial burden is inflicted on a Member State as a direct consequence of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement. The Commission proposes to take the financial burden on Member States’ budgets in order to face the additional needs stemming from and directly linked to a withdrawal without an agreement as the reference to determine eligibility. Access to the EUSF would be determined by a minimum level of public expenditure related to the withdrawal without agreement set at 0.3% of GNI or EUR 1.5 billion (whichever is lower), at 2011 prices, half the threshold for natural disasters. It is for the Member State to provide evidence for that expenditure and to demonstrate that it is directly imputable to the withdrawal without agreement. Such assistance may be used, for example, to provide support to businesses affected by the withdrawal without an agreement, including support to State aid measures for those businesses and related interventions; measures to preserve existing employment; and to ensure the functioning of border, customs, sanitary and phytosanitary controls, including additional personnel and infrastructure. VAT shall not constitute eligible expenditure. Procedure The competent national authorities of a Member State could submit to the Commission, by 30 April 2020 at the latest, a single application for a financial contribution from the Fund. The application should include at least all relevant information on the financial burden borne by that Member State. Where the Commission concludes that the conditions for granting a financial contribution from the Fund are met, it should without delay submit to the European Parliament and the Council the necessary proposals to trigger the intervention of the Fund and authorise the corresponding appropriations. When submitting an application for a financial contribution from the Fund to the Commission for serious financial burden caused by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union without an agreement, a Member State may request the payment of an advance. The Commission therefore proposes to raise the level of advance payments for individual disasters of all categories to 25% of the expected EUSF contribution, limited to a maximum of EUR 100 million. It also proposes to increase the total level of appropriations for EUSF advances in the annual budget from EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: in order to maintain the availability of the EUSF for major natural disasters, which is its original purpose, the use of the EUSF for the purpose of the present proposal should be limited to a maximum of 50% of its annual available amount in 2019 and 2020. The maximum annual allocation of the EUSF is EUR 500 million in 2011 prices. In current prices this means EUR 585.8 million for 2019 plus EUR 597.5 million for 2020, i.e. a total of EUR 1 183.3 million. Up to EUR 591.65 million would therefore be available for the purpose of the current proposal."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part, entered into force on 1 September 2017. A new type of poultry cut consists of a traditional breast cap with the humerus bones of the wings attached and can, after minimal transformation in the Union, be marketed in the Union as poultry breast. Unlimited imports of those cuts, of which imports from Ukraine reached 55 500 tons in 2018, therefore risk undermining the conditions under which traditional poultry breast cuts may be imported into the Union under the Association Agreement, in particular the quantitative restrictions in the form of a tariff rate quota. On 20 December 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Ukraine with a view to finding a solution by amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement. Those negotiations were successfully concluded on 19 March 2019. CONTENT: the purpose of the draft Council Decision is to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Union and Ukraine amending the trade preferences for poultry meat and poultry meat preparations provided for by the Association Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community and their Member States, of the one part, and Ukraine, of the other part."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in 2009, the European Union and the United States concluded a Memorandum of Understanding, revised in 2014, which provided an interim solution to a long-standing dispute in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) over imports of US beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. Under the agreement, a 45 000 tonnes quota of non-hormone treated beef was open by the EU to qualifying suppliers. Under WTO rules the quota also had to be made available to non-US suppliers. On 19 October 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations between the EU and the United States on the functioning of the tariff quota. Negotiations with the United States were concluded on 27 February 2019. The signed agreement, subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Agreement between the EU and the United States on the allocation to the United States of a share in the tariff quota for high-quality beef referred to in the Memorandum of Understanding on the importation of beef from animals not treated with certain growth-promoting hormones and increased duties applied by the United States to certain EU products, which was concluded in 2009 and revised in 2014. Under the new agreement, the existing quota will remain unchanged but 35 000 out of the total 45 000-tonne TRQ will be ring-fenced for the United States and phased in over a period of 7 years. The autonomous tariff quotas will continue to cover only products complying with EU's high food safety and health standards. This step is key to resolving a long-standing dispute between the EU and the United States on measures imposed by the EU in 1989 on US exports of beef treated with certain growth-promoting hormones. It also underlines the EU's commitment to a positive transatlantic trade agenda."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Jordan relations are part of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). Jordan signed an Association Agreement with the Union on 24 November 1997, which entered into force on 1 May 2002. In 2010, an Advanced Status partnership was agreed between the EU and Jordan. The Jordanian economy has been particularly affected by the conflict that has been raging in Syria since 2011. This regional unrest has caused a considerable deterioration in external revenues and strained public finances. They have affected tourism and foreign direct investment. Regardless of these conflicts, the supply of natural gas from Egypt has been disrupted for several years. In addition, the Jordanian economy has faced a massive influx of Syrian refugees, which has increased pressure on public finances, public services and infrastructure. Since the beginning of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Union has made available more than EUR 2.1 billion to Jordan under different instruments (including EUR 380 million under the two aforementioned MFA programmes) to help the country preserve economic stability, sustain political and economic reform and address its related humanitarian, development and security needs. In addition, the European Investment Bank has allocated around EUR 486 million in project loans to Jordan. A recent evaluation of the implementation of MFA operations concluded that the first MFA programme was adapted to Jordan's economic challenges and in line with EU priorities. The evaluation also found that the programme had been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities, had contributed to preserving macroeconomic stability and has had a positive social impact. In July 2019, given its still difficult economic situation and prospects, Jordan requested further macro-financial assistance from the Union. In this context, the Commission considers that the continued support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Jordan's international partners, of which the EU remains essential. CONTENT: the European Commission proposes to provide Jordan with additional macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 500 million in three instalments in the form of medium and long-term loans. The EU MFA is an exceptional emergency aid instrument designed to respond to serious balance of payments difficulties in third countries. The objective of the proposed MFA is to help Jordan cover part of its additional external financing needs in 2020-2021, reducing the economy’s short-term balance-of-payment and fiscal vulnerabilities as well as contributing to the debt sustainability. In addition, EU assistance would encourage Jordan to step up its reform efforts through a Memorandum of Understanding, to be agreed with the Jordanian authorities and shall include a package of measures to promote economic adjustment and the implementation of structural reforms. MFA funds shall be made available in the form of low-interest and long-term loans. Disbursements under the proposed programme shall be strictly conditional on the implementation of specific conditions, to be agreed between the EU and Jordan and set out in a Memorandum of Understanding. These conditions should be in line not only with the priorities of the EU-Jordan Partnership, as confirmed at the Brussels III Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region, held from 12 to 14 March 2019, and at the EU-Jordan Association Council on 17 July 2019, but also with the adjustment programmes agreed with the IMF and the World Bank."

BACKGROUND: the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/615/JHA) and the Decision on the implementation of the Prüm Decision (Decision 2008/616/JHA) are intended to improve the exchange of information between the services responsible for the prevention and investigation of criminal offences and to strengthen cross-border police and judicial cooperation between the Member States of the Union. The Prüm Decision contains, inter alia, provisions whereby Member States grant one another, on a mutual basis, access rights to their automated DNA analysis files, automated dactyloscopic identification systems and vehicle registration data. Council Framework Decision 2009/905/JHA on accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities (’the Forensic Decision’) lays down the requirements for the exchange of DNA and fingerprint data, in order to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO/IEC 17025 within any other Member State.

These negotiations were successfully concluded and resulted in the initialling of the agreement on 24 May 2018. The possibility for all the Member States to have access to the national databases of the Swiss Confederation, regarding the DNA, dactyloscopic and vehicle registration data, and the other way around, is undoubtedly of central importance in order to foster and encourage the cross border police cooperation. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Agreement between the European Union and Switzerland for the application of some of the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision. This international agreement between the EU and the Swiss Confederation aims to improve and simplify the automated exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement authorities of the Member States and the associated countries, in order to stimulate international police cooperation. The Agreement lists the provisions of the Prüm Decision, the Prüm Implementing Decision and the Forensic Decision that shall become applicable to the Swiss Confederation after entry into force of the Agreement. The Agreement also sets the provisions for uniform application, dispute settlement, amendments, notifications and declarations.

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to conclusion of the agreement. The ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013) allowed for the consultation of Eurodac by law enforcement authorities for the purpose of prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences. Since 2004, the Agreement between the European Community and the Switzerland concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland also covers the application of the ‘Dublin-related’ parts of Eurodac. This is also the case for Liechtenstein since 2008. However, law enforcement access, which was a new element of the ‘recast’ Eurodac Regulation compared to the original Eurodac regime (Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000) has not been regulated so far by the said Agreement. Therefore, Members called on the European Parliament to give its consent to the extension of the law enforcement provisions of the Regulation (EU) No. 603/2013 to Switzerland and Liechtenstein which would enable the law enforcement authorities of Switzerland and Liechtenstein to request a comparison of fingerprint data against the data entered by other participating States and stored in the Eurodac database when they seek to establish the identity or get further information concerning a person who is suspected of a serious crime or terrorism or concerning a victim."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 12 June 2002, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for Economic Partnership Agreements with the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States. The Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Community, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, which establishes a framework for an Economic Partnership Agreement, was signed in London on 30 July 2009. The Interim Partnership Agreement has been provisionally applied by Papua New Guinea, Fiji and Samoa since 20 December 2009, 28 July 2014 and 31 December 2018, respectively. The Agreement lays down the provisions regarding the accession of other Pacific Island States. In accordance with the Agreement, Solomon Islands submitted to the Council on 4 June 2018 an application for membership and an offer of market access. The Commission examined Solomon Islands' offer and, after modifications, has found it acceptable. Accordingly, the Commission concluded negotiations with Solomon Islands on 23 October 2018. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the Union, of Solomon Islands' accession to the Interim Partnership Agreement between the European Union, of the one part, and the Pacific States, of the other part, subject to the deposit of the Act of Accession by Solomon Islands. The EPA is a development-oriented trade agreement, which offers asymmetric market access to Solomon Islands and allows it to shield sensitive sectors from liberalisation, while providing a large number of safeguards and a clause for infant industry protection. It further contains provisions on the rules of origin that facilitate Solomon Islands' exports into the EU. Over the course of its implementation, the EPA will largely relieve EU exporters of industrial products to Solomon Islands from paying customs duties. Indeed, the EPA covers 90.3% of tariff lines, or 83% of the EU's export volume over 15 years. The Agreement also contains provisions on sustainable development. In accordance with the Agreement, the Union and Solomon Islands are to apply the Agreement on a provisional basis ten days after they have notified each other in writing that the necessary procedures have been completed."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in relation to the financing of the CAP, certain amendments of Regulation (EU) 1306/2013 on the financing, management and monitoring of the common agricultural policy (Horizontal Regulation) are needed to ensure that the financial discipline mechanism that makes it possible to respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation on the multi-annual financial framework can still operate for financial years post 2020. In relation to Direct Payments, Regulation (EU) 2019/288 amended Regulation (EU) No 1307/2013 establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under support schemes within the framework of the common agricultural policy (Direct Payments Regulation) to extend the flexibility between pillars foreseen for calendar years 2015-2019 to calendar year 2020/financial year 2021. This regulation sets up the amounts to transfer from the rural development to direct payments envelope as a percentage of the amount allocated to support financed under the EAFRD in financial year 2021 by Union legislation adopted after the adoption by the Council of the relevant Regulation pursuant to Article 312(2) TFEU. The relevant Union legislation may not be in place by the time the Member States need to notify their decision to transfer. To make it possible to apply the flexibility from rural development to direct payments, it is appropriate to establish the maximum amount that can be transferred based on a fixed amount and not a percentage. CONTENT: this proposal to amend Regulations (EU) No 1306/2013 and (EU) No 1307/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council aims to ensure the continuity of certain elements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a transitional period of one year from 2014-2020 until the rules on CAP strategic plans are applied, in line with the Commission's proposal on support for CAP strategic plans. Update of the reference for determining a financial discipline rate Expenditure under the EAGF within a given financial year shall respect the maximum ceiling set by the Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013. For that purpose, the said Regulation provides for the determination of a financial discipline adjustment rate. However, currently the relevant provisions refer to Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 which only sets the relevant ceilings for the period 2014-2020. To ensure that the ceiling for the financing of market related expenditure and direct payments post 2020 will also be respected, the legal reference of Articles 16 and 26 should be amended to include the regulation to be adopted by the Council for financial year 2021 onwards. Change of the basis for notifying the transfer from rural development to direct payments To ensure continuity in the possibility for Member States to transfer funds between the two pillars, already decided by the colegislators in Regulation (EU) 2019/288, the Commission proposed to replace the percentage of transfer by maximum absolute amounts based on the current maximum percentages. Member States had the possibility to review by 1 August 2019 the percentage of their national ceiling for direct payments, which they want to allocate to Voluntary Coupled Support (VCS), as well as their detailed support decisions (i.e. list of support measures and their envelopes, targeting, etc.). This review, if any, will apply from claim year 2020. In addition, Member States will have to notify only by 31 December 2019 or shortly thereafter their transfers between pillars affecting their national ceiling for direct payments for calendar year 2020. Budgetary implications The amounts included in the transitional proposal are in line with amounts proposed for the CAP under Heading 3 in the proposal covering the Multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. For market-related expenditure financed by the EAGF, allocations under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 will be adjusted to the level which were proposed for the same sectors in the proposal on support for the CAP strategic plans, for financial year 2021. The amendments of Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 ensure that a financial discipline adjustment rate can be determined in financial years 2021 and onwards where the expenditure forecasts for the measures financed under the EAGF net ceiling for a given financial year indicate that the applicable annual ceilings would be exceeded. Thereby, the amendment potentially decreases expenditure under EAGF to the maximum level agreed for the fund in the multiannual financial framework. The amendment of the flexibility provision for calendar year 2020 (financial year 2021) is a technical adjustment to ensure applicability of the provision and does not have any financial implications compared to those intended for the existing provision. The review option for the voluntary coupled support may lead to financial reallocations between measures within the Member States but these will remain within the national ceiling and as such do not require additional financing."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the Protocol. As a reminder, the Eurodac Regulation (recast) (Regulation (EU) No 603/2013) enables law enforcement authorities to consult Eurodac in order to prevent, detect and investigate terrorist offences and other serious criminal offences.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 29 March 2017, the United Kingdom notified the European Council of its intention to withdraw from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community in accordance with Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. On 22 May 2017, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with the United Kingdom with a view to concluding an agreement laying down the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking into account the framework of its future relations with the Union. The agreement was negotiated in the light of the European Council's guidelines and in accordance with the Council's negotiating directives and with the European Parliament's resolutions of 5 April 2017 , 3 October 2017, 13 December 2017 and 14 March 2018. On 14 November 2018, negotiators for the European Commission and the United Kingdom reached agreement on the full withdrawal agreement and on the broad lines of the political declaration on future relations between the EU and the United Kingdom. An agreement on future relations between the Union and the United Kingdom can only be concluded after the United Kingdom has become a third country. However, Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union requires that the framework for future relations with the Union be taken into account in the agreement setting out the arrangements for withdrawal. The withdrawal agreement sets out the terms and conditions for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the EU. It ensures that the withdrawal shall be carried out in an orderly manner, and provides legal certainty once the Treaties and Union law have ceased to apply in the United Kingdom. The withdrawal agreement is necessary to mitigate any negative effects on the European economy and the Union budget, protect the rights of the European citizens living and working in the United Kingdom, as well as safeguard the goal of peace and reconciliation in the island of Ireland. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The Commission's draft text proposal for the withdrawal agreement consists of 185 articles structured in six parts, three protocols and nine annexes. The areas concerned are as follows: Part 1: Common Provisions The agreement sets out the clauses necessary to ensure the correct understanding, operation and interpretation of the withdrawal agreement. The provisions of the withdrawal agreement were clearly to have the same legal effects in the United Kingdom as in the EU and its Member States. The agreement expressly provides for this obligation, which means that both parties must ensure, in their respective legal systems, primacy and direct effect, as well as a consistent interpretation with the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) prior to the end of the transitional period. Part 2: Citizens' Rights The agreement lays down provisions to safeguard the status and rights derived from Union law of EU and UK citizens, and their families, affected by the United Kingdom withdrawal. The basic conditions for residence are and will remain the same as those currently provided for under EU law on free movement. Persons covered by the withdrawal agreement will have the right to take up paid employment or engage in economic activity as self-employed workers. They will also retain all the rights they enjoy as workers under Union law. The withdrawal agreement will also protect the rights of employed or self-employed frontier workers in the countries where they work. As regards the rules on the coordination of social security systems, persons benefiting from the part of the withdrawal agreement devoted to citizens' rights will retain their rights to health care, a pension and other social security benefits. These provisions are intended to ensure a smooth termination of the current arrangements and to ensure an orderly withdrawal (for example, to allow goods placed on the market before the end of the transitional period to reach their destination, to protect existing intellectual property rights, to put an end to ongoing police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, to regulate the use of data and information exchanged before the end of the transitional period). Part 4 - Transition Period The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period until the end of 2020. During this period, the full acquis of the Union will continue to apply to the United Kingdom as if it were a Member State. The United Kingdom will thus continue to be part of the EU's customs union and single market (with the four freedoms) and to participate in the Union's policies. From the date of withdrawal (i.e. including during the transitional period), the United Kingdom will no longer be represented in the Union's institutions and will no longer participate in the Union's decision-making process. During the transition period, the United Kingdom will have to comply with the EU's trade policy and will continue to be bound by the Union's exclusive competence, in particular with regard to the common trade policy. It will not be able to conclude new agreements on its own in areas of exclusive Union competence, unless it is authorised to do so by the Union. The withdrawal agreement provides for the possibility of extending the transition period. This possibility may only be used once, the decision to this effect having to be taken before 1 July 2020. Part 5: Financial Provisions Under the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom will honour its share of the financing of all obligations incurred during its membership of the Union relating to the EU budget (and in particular the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020, including payments made after the end of the transitional period linked to the closure of programmes). Part 6: Institutional Provisions The agreement sets out rules for the consistent interpretation and application of the agreement and establishes a Joint Committee as well as a dispute settlement mechanism. The withdrawal agreement also provides for: - a protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland including the provisions necessary for the so-called “backstop” solution for avoiding a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This will apply unless and until it is superseded, in whole or in part, by any subsequent agreement. The Protocol creates a single EU-UK customs territory. It also provides for a range of measures to ensure a level playing field between the EU and the United Kingdom. In this protocol, the United Kingdom undertakes not to reduce the rights set out in the Good Friday Agreement (Belfast Agreement) of 1998, and to protect North-South cooperation; - a Protocol on Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus , to protect the interests of Cypriots living and working in the Sovereign Base Areas after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union; - a Protocol on Gibraltar , which provides for close cooperation between Spain and the United Kingdom on Gibraltar, as regards the implementation of the provisions of the withdrawal agreement relating to citizens' rights, and which concerns administrative cooperation between the competent authorities in a number of policy areas. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: the only budgetary impact of the withdrawal agreement (EUR 288 million per year over 4 years) stems from the establishment of the Joint Committee which will supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the withdrawal agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 23 April 2007, the Council authorised the Commission to enter into negotiations for a region-to-region Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). On 22 December 2009, the Council agreed on the principle of launching bilateral negotiations with individual ASEAN countries based on the authorisation and negotiating directives of 2007, whilst preserving the strategic objective of a region-to-region agreement. On the basis of the negotiating directives adopted by the Council in 2007, and supplemented in October 2013 to include investment protection, the Commission has negotiated with Vietnam an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and an Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), with a view to creating new opportunities and legal certainty for trade and investment between both partners to develop. Vietnam has become the EU's second biggest trading partner in ASEAN after Singapore and ahead of Malaysia, with trade between the EU and Vietnam worth EUR 47.6 billion in 2017. It is one of the fastest growing countries in ASEAN. According to a study on the economic benefits to be expected from the FTA, EU exports to Vietnam are expected to increase by more than EUR 8 billion by 2035, while exports from Vietnam to the EU are expected to increase by EUR 15 billion. These estimates correspond to an increase, in relative terms, in EU exports to Vietnam of almost 29% and in exports from Vietnam to the EU of almost 18%. The EU's national income could increase by more than EUR 1.9 billion by 2035 as a result of the FTA, while Vietnam's could increase by EUR 6 billion over the same period. CONTENT: the draft Council decision concerns the approval, on behalf of the European Union, of the Free Trade Agreement between the European Union and Vietnam. The Agreement was signed subject to its conclusion at a later date. In line with the objectives set by the negotiating directives, the Commission secured: the comprehensive liberalisation of services and investment markets, including crosscutting rules on licensing and for the mutual recognition of diplomas, and sectorspecific rules designed to ensure a level playing field for EU businesses; new tendering opportunities for EU bidders in Vietnam, who is not a member of the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement; the removal of technical and regulatory trade barriers to trade in goods, such as duplicative testing, in particular by promoting the use of technical and regulatory standards familiar in the EU in the sectors of motor vehicles, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, as well as green technologies; based on international standards, a more trade-facilitative regime for the approval of European food exports to Vietnam; Vietnam’s commitment to reduce or eliminate its tariffs on imports from the EU, and a cheaper access of European businesses and consumers to products originating in Vietnam; a high level protection of intellectual property rights, including with regard to the enforcement of these rights, also at the border, and a TRIPs-plus level of protection of EU GIs; a comprehensive chapter on trade and sustainable development, which aims at ensuring that trade supports labour rights, environmental protection and social development and promotes the sustainable management of forests and fisheries; and a swift dispute resolution mechanisms through either panel arbitration or with the help of a mediator. The EU-Vietnam FTA and IPA include institutional provisions that lay down an implementing bodies’ structure to continuously monitor the implementation, operation and impact of the agreements. It establishes a Trade Committee that has as its main task to supervise and facilitate the implementation and application of the agreement."

Vietnam is a vibrant economy of more than 90 million inhabitants, with the fastest growing middle class in ASEAN, and a young and dynamic workforce. With its high literacy rate and education levels, comparatively low wages, good connectivity and a central location within ASEAN, more and more foreign investors are choosing Vietnam as their hub to service the Mekong region and beyond.

The agreement, signed subject to its conclusion at a later date, must now be approved. The EU-Vietnam IPA will ensure a high level of investment protection, while safeguarding the EU’s and Vietnam’s rights to regulate and pursue legitimate public policy objectives such as the protection of public health, safety and the environment."

As a reminder, the False and Authentic Documents Online system (FADO) was established by Joint Action 98/700/JHA within the General Secretariat of the Council. Over the past years, the Agency has developed expertise in the area of document fraud. The Agency is therefore to take over the administration as well as the operation and technical management of FADO from the General Secretariat of the Council. It shall be ensured that, during the transitional period, FADO remains fully operational until the transfer has been effectively carried out and the existing information has been transferred to the new system. The ownership of the existing data should then be transferred to the Agency. The proposed Regulation aims to repeal Council Joint Action 98/700/JHA. The committee recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission's proposal. The main amendments concern the following: Subject matter The aim of the proposed Regulation is to constitute a new legislative basis for governing FADO. Its purpose is to provide up-to-date information on authentic and false documents and to contribute to the fight against document and identity fraud by sharing information on security features and potential fraud characteristics in authentic and false documents between the competent national authorities, with third parties, such as Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and, where applicable, with third countries, territorial entities, international organisations, other entities subject to international law and private entities, and on authentic documents with the general public. Scope FADO shall contain information on specimen travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licenses and vehicle licenses issued by Member States and falsified versions of such documents in their possession. It may also contain other related official documents that are used when applying for travel, residence or identity documents issued by Member States, and, where applicable, by third countries, territorial entities and international organisations. It should be noted that the proposed Regulation shall not affect the competence of Member States relating to the recognition of passports, travel documents, visas or other identity documents. Categories of documents and data contained in FADO FADO shall include the following: - information, including images, on specimen documents, their security features, on false, forged, counterfeit or pseudo documents and their fraud characteristics; - summary information on forgery techniques; - statistics on detected false documents; - recommendations on effective ways of detecting specific methods of forgery. Member States shall transmit without delay to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (the ‘Agency’) all the data on specimen and fraudulent travel, identity, residence and civil status documents, driving licenses and vehicle licenses in relation to which they are data controller under the applicable Union data protection law. When the Member States become data controller in respect of additional data on such documents and licenses, they shall also transmit them without delay to the Agency. Responsibilities of the Agency The Agency shall: - be responsible for establishing FADO in accordance with this Regulation. It shall ensure the functioning of FADO 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and provide for the its maintenance and updating; - provide the Member States’ competent authorities with near real-time assistance in the detection and identification of falsified documents. FADO’s architecture and access thereto Members proposed that FADO’s architecture shall enable different levels of access rights to FADO. Only document experts from the Member States’ authorities competent in the area of document fraud, such as border police and other law enforcement authorities, shall have access to FADO in an unrestricted manner. Protection and processing of personal data Member States shall ensure that individuals whose personal data are used on specimen and falsified documents are protected in accordance with the relevant applicable rules, including as regards the processing of their personal data in FADO. Personal data shall be limited to what is strictly necessary for the purposes of FADO. FADO should contain personal data in the form of a facial image or alphanumerical data only insofar as they are related to the security features in a specimen document or the method of falsification of a falsified document."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 contains a ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule, whereby air carriers must use at least 80% of their allocated slots within a given scheduling period (summer or winter) in order to keep precedence in respect of the same series of slots within the corresponding scheduling period of the next year (so-called ‘grandfather rights’). Due to the reduced demand for passenger traffic caused by the coronavirus outbreak, air carriers have already started and will continue to cancel flights, which will result in slot usage for the winter 2019-2020 and summer 2020 scheduling periods below the 80 % threshold imposed by the Regulation. According to Eurocontrol, the number of flights fell by 10% in the first two weeks of March 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Given the decreasing demand caused by the crisis, most European air carriers are grounding aircraft. European airports expect a loss of 67 million passengers in the first quarter of 2020. This phenomenon is seriously affecting air transport across the Union. On the basis of the information currently available from Eurocontrol, from air carriers and from airports, it is reasonable to assume that the current situation, characterised by an exceptional fall in demand, will last at least for the months of March, April, May and June 2020. In the absence of any measure neutralising, for the purposes of this calculation, the effects of the current circumstances, it is likely that air carriers will operate many flights with very low load factors in order to protect their grandfather rights, thus exacerbating financial losses and causing an adverse impact on the environment. CONTENT: in order to allow airlines to adapt their capacity in light of the decline in demand caused by the epidemic, and to protect the financial health of airlines and the environment, the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 in order to protect the grandfather rights of air carriers for those slots that have not been used during the period when the aviation market has been most affected by the outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19). The proposed period covers the four-month period between March 2020 and June 2020 for all flights. The proposed amendment would come in form of a rule whereby coordinators shall consider slots allocated for the reference periods in question as having been operated. This rule would mitigate the effects of the current crisis and provide legal certainty to the air carriers for the relevant parts of the scheduling periods. Any slots freed by air carriers as a result could be reallocated by coordinators according to needs. The Commission may extend the period during which the measures are applicable, if necessary by means of delegated acts. The Commission shall base such decisions on the most recent information available, published by Eurocontrol, and on relevant scientific advice. Additionally, given that the severe impact of the outbreak of the SARS CoV-2 virus became apparent first in China and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, it is proposed to protect during a longer overall period the grandfathering rights for slots used for air services to and from those markets. The additional period starts on 23 January 2020, the date on which the first airport in the People’s Republic of China was closed by the authorities."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."

BACKGROUND: this initiative complements the Commission's proposal of 13 March 2020 for specific measures to mobilise investment in Member States' healthcare systems and other sectors of their economies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative), as well as all other measures to address the current unprecedented situation. In view of the deep and worsening negative impact on EU economies and societies, the Commission considers it necessary to grant Member States exceptional additional flexibility to enable them to respond to this crisis by strengthening the possibility to mobilise all unused aid from the Funds. The proposal follows extensive consultations with Member States and the European Parliament in recent weeks and takes into account the more than 200 questions of clarification and advice received from national authorities on their handling of crisis response measures through the Coronavirus Investment Initiative Task Force. CONTENT: the proposal aims to introduce extraordinary flexibility to allow maximum mobilization of all unused aid from the European Structural and Investment Funds. This flexibility would be provided by: - the possibility of temporarily granting, for the implementation of cohesion policy programmes for the financial year 2020-2021, a 100% co-financing rate from the EU budget; - additional transfer possibilities between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Cohesion Fund, as well as between categories of regions; -the introduction of some flexibility in terms of thematic concentration, to allow Member States to redirect resources to the areas most affected by the current crisis; - the relaxation of certain obligations for Member States, where these entail an administrative burden that could delay the implementation of measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic; - the simplification of procedural requirements related to audits and financial instruments; - the possibilities for the support for working capital through financial instruments should be extended to the EAFRD. Lastly, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1301/2013 to allow for ERDF support to be provided for undertakings in difficulties in these specific circumstances, thus ensuring consistency with the approach taken under the Temporary Framework for State Aid Measures to support the economy in the current COVID-19 outbreak and with rules for the granting of de minimis aid.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the crisis caused by the COVID 19 epidemic is increasing the risks for the most vulnerable, in particular the most deprived, and may in particular disrupt the support provided by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The distribution of food and basic material assistance, as well as social inclusion support, is facing increasingly logistical and human resource constraints, notably due to the confinement and urgent need to instate social distancing measures to contain the spread of the virus. Many of the volunteers, who are the backbone of the Fund, can no longer be mobilised, as they often belong to groups at a higher risk of severe illness caused by COVID-19. The Fund's main objective is to support the development of the country's capacity to provide food and basic material assistance. Specific measures must be taken as a matter of urgency in order to protect the most vulnerable from this disease and to ensure that they continue to receive assistance from the FEAD, in particular with regard to the provision of the necessary protective equipment against the disease. This initiative complements the first ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’, a package of measures proposed by the Commission on 13 March 2020 which introduced a number of important changes to provide a more effective response to the current situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in order to address the difficulties encountered by public authorities and partner organisations in implementing the FEAD during the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific measures The proposed measures provide for the following:  eligibility of expenditure incurred from 1 February 2020 for FEAD operations that strengthen the capacity to respond to the coronavirus pandemic; the possibility to give Member States the exceptional possibility to apply for a co-financing rate of 100% for the accounting year 2020-2021; flexibility for Member States (i) to adjust the schemes of support to the current context, including by allowing alternative schemes of delivery through electronic vouchers (lower risk of contamination) and by allowing Member States (ii) to amend certain elements of the operational programme without requiring an adoption by Commission decision; possibility to provide the necessary protective materials and equipment to partner organisations outside the technical assistance budget; flexibility measures which reduce the administrative burden on the authorities in terms of compliance with certain legislative requirements, in particular as regards monitoring and control and audit; specific provisions regarding the eligibility of costs incurred by beneficiaries in case the delivery of food/basic material assistance or social assistance is delayed as well as for suspended and not fully implemented operations. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments set out in the FEAD Regulation. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived remains unchanged. The proposal will facilitate an acceleration of programme implementation and result in a frontloading of payment appropriations. The Commission will carefully monitor the impact of the proposed modification on payment appropriations in 2020 taking into account both the implementation of the budget and revised Member States forecasts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the fishery and aquaculture sector has been particularly hard hit by the market disruption generated by a significant drop in demand following the COVID-19 pandemic. This crisis can consequently have dramatic socio-economic consequences in certain communities where fishing and aquaculture play a key role. Small-scale coastal fisheries represent close to 75% of all active vessels and over 55% of direct employment; they constitute the main economic activity in many coastal areas. On 13 March 2020, the Commission proposed a ‘Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative’ directed at promoting investments by mobilising available cash reserves in the European Structural and Investments Funds, to fight the crisis immediately. However, the fact that fishing and aquaculture activities have been interrupted or significantly reduced makes it difficult to implement the current operational measures and programmes under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) in a normal way. In the absence of effective measures to tackle the crisis, the EMFF is unlikely to be fully implemented by the end of the current programming period. The Commission considers that it should be possible for the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 to support specific measures until 31 December 2020 to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector. CONTENT: the proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 (EMFF Regulation) and Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 (CMO Regulation) in order to introduce specific measures under the EMFF to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the fisheries and aquaculture sector. Specific measures The amendments to the EMFF are intended to allow a more flexible redistribution of financial resources within operational programmes in each Member State and a simplified procedure for amending operational programmes as regards the introduction of new measures. The proposed specific measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the fishery and aquaculture sector comprise: - support to fishermen for the temporary cessation of fishing activities caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to aquaculture farmers for the temporary suspension or the reduction of production caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, - support to producer organisations and associations of producer organisations for the storage of fishery and aquaculture products, in accordance with the Common Market Organisation (CMO). It is proposed that these measures are retroactively eligible as of 1 February 2020 and available until 31 December 2020. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The annual breakdown of commitment appropriations for the EMFF remains unchanged. The available payment appropriations in the 2020 budget for the EMFF can accommodate a shift between Union Priorities within operational programmes. The new measures will in fact to a large extent replace initially planned initiatives, which are now being stopped due to the general decline of economic activity. By consequence, the proposed measures aim to ensure an effective implementation of the 2020 budget and the 2014-2020 allocation for the EMFF."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medical devices. At the same time, it sets high standards of quality and safety for medical devices in order to meet common safety concerns as regards such devices. Regulation (EU) 2017/745 significantly reinforces key elements of the existing regulatory approach in Council Directive 90/385/EEC and Council Directive 93/42/EEC, such as the supervision of notified bodies, conformity assessment procedures, clinical investigations and clinical evaluation, vigilance and market surveillance, whilst introducing provisions ensuring transparency and traceability regarding medical devices, to improve health and safety. The coronavirus pandemic and the resulting public health crisis represent an unprecedented challenge for Member States and a heavy burden for national authorities, health care institutions and economic operators. The coronavirus crisis has created exceptional circumstances that require considerable additional resources and increased availability of vitally important medical devices such as medical gloves, surgical masks or intensive care equipment. None of these measures could reasonably have been anticipated at the time of the adoption of the Medical Devices Regulation. These extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on different areas covered by the Medical Devices Regulation. It is therefore very likely that Member States, health care institutions, economic operators and other stakeholders would not have been able to ensure its proper implementation and application from the date of application initially foreseen on 26 May 2020. CONTENT: for exceptional reasons, in the current context of the coronavirus epidemic, the Commission proposes to defer by one year, to 26 May 2021, the date of application of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2017/745 which should have applied from 26 May 2020. The proposed amendment aims to achieve the objectives of Regulation (EU) 2017/745, namely the establishment of a rigorous, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework for medical devices that ensures a high level of protection of public health and patient safety and the proper functioning of the internal market for these devices. At the same time, it is proposed to defer the date of repeal of Directive 90/385/EEC on active implantable medical devices and Directive 93/42/EEC on medical devices by one year. These postponements would ensure that an operational regulatory framework for medical devices would be in place from 26 May 2020. In addition, the proposed amendment aims to ensure that, in exceptional cases, the Commission may adopt, as soon as possible, EU-wide derogations following national derogations, in order to effectively address potential shortages of vitally important medical devices in the EU. In view of the urgent need to respond immediately to the public health crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed amending Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Regulation. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, which require extraordinary measures to be taken, have put great pressure on the available financial resources within and outside the multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings. In order for the Union to be able to finance an appropriate response to the COVID-19 outbreak and the associated public health and economic crisis, it is necessary to modify the purpose for which the available appropriations under the Global Margin for Commitments can be used, insofar as it refers to growth and employment, in particular youth employment, and to migration and security measures. This draft Regulation is directly linked to financing included in amending budget No 2 to the general budget of the Union for 2020 in the framework of which the Global Margin for Commitments is mobilised to finance measures in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak. It should also be noted that in order to provide urgent financing, it was considered appropriate to provide for a derogation from the eight-week period referred to in Article 4 of Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments in the European Union. This period refers to elapse of time between a draft legislative act being made available to national Parliaments and the date when it is placed on a provisional agenda for the Council for its adoption or for adoption of a position under a legislative procedure. CONTENT: the Council proposes that Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 1311/2013 (MFF Regulation) should therefore be amended to stipulate that the commitment appropriations may be entered in the budget over and above the ceilings of the relevant headings laid down in the MFF where it is necessary to use the resources from the Emergency Aid Reserve, the European Union Solidarity Fund, the Flexibility Instrument, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, the Contingency Margin, the specific flexibility to tackle youth unemployment and strengthen research and the Global Margin for Commitments. Margins left available below the MFF ceilings for commitment appropriations shall constitute a Global Margin for Commitments, to be made available over and above the ceilings established in the MFF for the years 2016 to 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is having a very negative impact on the economic and financial stability of the regions affected by enlargement and the neighbourhood policy. Most, if not all, enlargement and neighbourhood partners are set for a recession this year. Depending on the spread of the virus, as well as of its economic consequences, there is also a clear and imminent risk related to social stability and security, with possible spill-overs within the region and beyond. In these circumstances, the European Commission proposes to use Macro Financial Assistance (MFA) to support ten Neighbourhood countries in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. MFA is one of the instruments available to the EU to respond to external crises. It is used to address balance of payments crisis situations, in tandem with a disbursing International Monetary Fund (IMF) arrangement that is subject to an agreed programme of economic reforms. The proposal is part of the ‘Team Europe’ strategy, which is the targeted response by which the EU intends to support its partners in their fight against the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to make available to partners a total of up to EUR 3 billion in medium and long-term loans to help cover their external financing needs in 2020 and 2021. Breakdown of the AMF Based on a preliminary assessment of financing needs, the amounts of MFA to be made available shall be distributed to the beneficiaries as follows:  Republic of Albania (EUR 180 million); Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUR 250 million); Georgia (EUR 150 million); Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (EUR 200 million); Kosovo (EUR 100 million); Republic of Moldova (EUR 100 million); Montenegro (EUR 60 million); Republic of Northern Macedonia (EUR 160 million); Republic of Tunisia (EUR 600 million); Ukraine (EUR 1.2 billion). The proposed MFA amounts would be made available to the beneficiary countries for 12 months in the form of loans granted on very favourable terms to help them meet their immediate and urgent financing needs. The assistance is planned to be disbursed in two loan instalments. The disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2020. The second instalment could be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in the first half of 2021 provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. Objectives and conditions Combined with IMF support, this financing shall:  contribute to covering the external financing needs of the partner in the context of a significant deterioration of their external accounts brought about by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis; alleviate the partner’s budgetary financing needs; support the fiscal consolidation effort and external stabilisation in the context of the foreseen IMF programme; support structural reforms aimed at improving the overall macroeconomic management, strengthening economic governance and transparency, and improving conditions for sustainable growth. The granting of the EU MFA shall be subject to:  the pre-condition that the partner respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights; satisfactory progress with the IMF programme and the continued drawing by the partner on IMF funds. The Commission shall report yearly to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of this Decision in the preceding year. Furthermore, the fulfilment of the objectives of the assistance shall be assessed not later than two years after the expiry of the availability period of the assistance. Budgetary implications The planned assistance shall be provided in the form of loans and should be financed through a borrowing operation that the Commission shall conduct on behalf of the EU. The budgetary impact of the assistance shall correspond to the provisioning, at a rate of 9%, of the amounts disbursed in the Guarantee Fund for External Actions of the EU. The Commission considers that the budgetary impact of the proposed MFA operations can be accommodated within the Commission’s proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic led to a sharp fall in air traffic due to a significant drop in demand and the adoption by Member States and third countries of direct measures, such as border closures and flight bans, to curb its spread. Figures published by the EU Network Manager at the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (‘Eurocontrol’), indicate a fall in air traffic of around 90% for the European region at the end of March 2020 as compared to March 2019. The aviation sector is of strategic importance to the European Union and makes a vital contribution to the EU’s overall economy and employment. In 2016, for example, the aviation sector supported 9.4 million jobs in the EU and contributed more than EUR 624 billion to the EU's GDP. It also contributes to the success of SMEs and tourism. The liquidity crisis in the aviation sector may lead to insolvencies within a few months if left unaddressed. Given the contribution of aviation to the overall performance of the EU economy and the importance of its overall weight, the Commission considers it essential that the EU takes action to support the EU aviation sector. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to temporarily amend several provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council to allow the Commission and national authorities to more easily address a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to mitigate of the impacts on the aviation sector for the duration of the crisis. These temporary measures include the following: Modification to air carrier licencing rules in case of financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 outbreak Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008, Member States must suspend or revoke the operating licence of any air carrier, which may not to be able to fulfil its actual or potential financial obligations for the next twelve months. Alternatively, the authorities may grant a temporary licence to such airlines. However, experience has shown that it also sends a very negative signal to the market about the ability of an airline to survive, which in turn aggravates its financial problems, in particular in terms of cash flow. Accordingly, the proposal proposes that based on assessments, carried out from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, the competent licensing authority may decide before the end of that period not to suspend or revoke the operating license of the Union carrier provided that safety is not at risk, and that there is a realistic prospect of a satisfactory financial reconstruction within the following 12 months. Simplification of procedures for the imposition of restrictions on traffic rights The proposal provides for a temporary derogation to procedural requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008. The derogation clarifies that a Member State may temporarily keep a justified and proportionate emergency measure in place for a period beyond 14 days – but limited to the duration of public health risks clearly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should be able to refuse, limit or impose conditions on the exercise of traffic rights to deal with problems resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic which could be of extended duration. Such emergency measures taken in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic should respect the principles of proportionality and transparency and should be based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. At the request of any of the Member State(s) involved or on its own initiative, the Commission may suspend this action if it does not meet the requirements of the Regulation or is otherwise contrary to Union law. To this effect, Member States are obliged to inform the Commission about changes in duration and scope of their emergency measures. Improving the efficiency of ground handling contracting during the COVID-19 crisis The proposal allows the managing bodies of airport to prolong contracts of suppliers of ground handling service until 31 December 2021, in derogation of Directive 96/67/EC. It also allows the managing body of an airport to directly choose a ground handling service for a maximum period of six months. The amendments also provide for the possibility for the Commission to extend the periods concerned by means of delegated acts."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 crisis has created extraordinary circumstances that affect normal activity of the competent authorities in the Member States and the work of transport undertakings as regards the administrative formalities to be completed in different transport sectors that could not reasonably have been anticipated at the time of adoption of the relevant measures. Those extraordinary circumstances have a significant impact on various areas covered by Union transport law. In particular, transport operators and other persons concerned may not be able to complete the necessary formalities or procedures to comply with certain provisions of Union law related to the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or authorisations or to complete other steps necessary to maintain their validity. This is the case, for instance, with driving licences, roadworthiness tests for motor vehicles and their trailers, Community licences and driver attestations for the provisions of road haulage services, rail single safety certificates or authorisations, boatmasters’ certificates or port security assessments etc. It is most likely that those certificates, licences, authorisations which, in accordance with Union law, would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 could not be renewed in due time. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt temporary provisions extending the validity of those certificates, licences or authorisations that would expire between 1 March 2020 and 31 August 2020 and ensure that they remain valid during a reasonable period of time during and after the COVID-19 outbreak. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation lays down specific and temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and the postponement of certain periodic checks and training in response to the extraordinary circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak in the area of road, rail and inland waterways transport and maritime security. This proposal concerns specific provisions that affect the application of several Directives and Regulations:  Directive 2003/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council which (lays down the initial qualification and periodic training requirements for professional drivers of trucks and buses with the objective to ensure safety on European roads). Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (provides for the mutual recognition of the driving licences issued by Member States based on a Union model driving licence). Directive 2014/45/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (defines the harmonised minimum requirements for periodic roadworthiness testing). Regulation (EC) No 1071/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council (lays down common rules concerning the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator).

Directive 2004/49/EC and Directive (EU) 2016/798 (regulate safety certification and authorisation in the Union).

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the outbreak of COVID-19 is having a serious impact on maritime transport and on the financial sustainability of operators and is likely to continue to have an impact throughout 2020. Regulation (EU) 2017/352 of the European Parliament and of the Council requires Member States to ensure that port infrastructure charges are levied by a managing body of a port or by a competent authority. There is no exception from this obligation to levy charges, not even in exceptional circumstances. However, in view of the consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is appropriate to allow Member States to provide the managing bodies of a port or the competent authorities with the possibility to waive, suspend, reduce or defer the payment of port infrastructure charges due for the period from 1 March 2020 to 31 December 2020. CONTENT: the Commission therefore proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2017/352 which establishes a framework for the provision of port services and common rules on the financial transparency of ports. It is proposed that the new transitional provision shall provide Member States with the option to allow managing bodies of a port or competent authorities to decide whether to:  waive (condone, i.e. not require the payment at all); or suspend (freeze or put on hold the payment for a certain time period); or reduce (decrease the payment); or defer (require the payment at a later point in time) the payment of the port infrastructure charges. As the duration of the impact on maritime transport of the outbreak of COVID-19 is uncertain and in order to allow for sufficient flexibility for the sector, the new transitional provision shall apply to port infrastructure charges due for the period between 1 March 2020 and 31 December 2020. This new provision also stipulates that the managing body of a port or the competent authority shall ensure that port users and the representatives or associations of port users are informed accordingly. The time limit of two months referred to in Regulation (EU) 2017/352 shall not apply."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council.

Only eight Member States have transposed both Directives in 2019 (BG, FI, FR, GR, IT, NL, RO, SI). In the light of COVID-19 outbreak, most of the remaining 17 Member States have requested a delay to transposition, claiming they will be unable to complete the necessary legislation before 16 June 2020. Since the COVID-19 outbreak struck in the final stage of adoption of the national transposition measures, it is proposed that Member States should be allowed an additional period of three months to complete the transposition process.

CONTENT: therefore, the Commission proposes that Member States should be able to complete the process in an additional period of three months (16 September 2020). A number of implementing acts and delegated acts have been adopted in accordance with Directive (EU) 2016/797 and Directive (EU) 2016/798.

The Agreement has been renewed for additional periods of five years, in 2009 and 2015 respectively. The current Agreement is due to expire on 17 May 2020. The Commission believes that the Agreement provides an important framework for conducting and facilitating cooperation between the EU and India in common priority science and technology areas of mutual benefit. In the past years, under the Horizon 2020 Programme, - a joint call on water resulted in 7 selected projects for a total of EUR 30 million with the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT); - a joint call on new generation vaccines with DBT for a total of EUR 30 million resulted in 3 selected projects; - two innovation initiatives were launched: an incubators network and an innovation platform, resulting on more than 20 innovation partnerships among its participants; - an Implementing Arrangement between the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and the European Commission was signed to facilitate mobility of Indian researchers to European Research Council grantees teams; - two cofunding mechanisms were set up by DBT and the Ministry of Earth Science (MoES) to fund successful Indian participants in more than 50 Horizon 2020 calls. At the meeting of the India-EU Joint Steering Committee established by the Agreement, held in New Delhi on 1 March 2019, both Parties noted their intention to renew the Agreement for a further period of five years without any amendment.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit in May 2009, the EU reaffirmed its political support towards full liberalisation of the visa regime in a secure environment, and towards promoting mobility by concluding visa facilitation and readmission agreements with Eastern Partnership countries. According to the common approach for the development of EU policy on visa facilitation agreed at the level of COREPER by the Member States in December 2005, a visa facilitation agreement would not be concluded without a readmission agreement being in place. On that basis, the Commission presented on 12 November 2010, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate Agreements with the Republic of Belarus on, respectively, the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas, and readmission of persons residing without authorisation. Negotiations with Belarus were officially opened in Brussels on 30 January 2014 and resulted in an agreement initialled on 17 June 2019. In the meantime, Belarus, the European Union and seven participating Member States (Bulgaria, Romania, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Finland and Latvia) signed a joint declaration on a mobility partnership on 13 October 2016. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and Belarus to facilitate the readmission of persons residing without authorisation. The purpose of the Agreement is to establish rapid and effective procedures for the identification and safe and orderly return of persons who do not, or no longer, fulfil the conditions for entry to, presence in, or residence on the territory of Belarus or one of the Member States of the European Union, and to facilitate the transit of such persons in a spirit of co-operation. The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - an opening clause reaffirming that the agreement must be applied in such a way as to ensure respect for human rights and the obligations and responsibilities of the requested and requesting States under the international instruments applicable to them; - readmission obligations on the basis of full reciprocity, applying to nationals as well as third-country nationals and stateless persons; - obligation to readmit nationals also concerning (i) former nationals who have been deprived of their nationality or who have renounced it without obtaining the nationality of another State; (ii) family members (i.e. spouse and unmarried minor children), whatever their nationality, who do not have an independent right of residence in the requesting State; - obligation to readmit third-country nationals and stateless persons subject to certain preconditions. This obligation does not apply to persons who have only carried out airport transit or who have obtained a visa or residence permit from the requested Member State unless, for example, the person does not comply with one of the conditions attached to the visa; - definition of the technical modalities governing the readmission procedure (readmission application, means of evidence, time limits, transfer modalities and modes of transport). Procedural flexibility is provided by the fact that no readmission application will be needed in cases where the person to be readmitted is in possession of a valid travel document; - description of the agreed accelerated procedure for persons apprehended in an area extending up to 30 kilometres beyond the common land border between a Member State and Belarus, as well as on the territory of the international airports of the Member States and Belarus. - necessary rules on costs, data protection and the position of the agreement in relation to other international obligations. In particular, the proposal for a Decision specifies that the Commission, assisted by experts from the Member States, shall represent the Union in the Joint Readmission Committee established by the Agreement. The specific situation of Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is reflected in the preamble, and, regarding Denmark, in a relevant joint declaration."

The Commission considers that the objectives set by the Council in its negotiating directives have been achieved and that the draft agreement is acceptable to the Union. The main elements of the final agreement are as follows: - for all visa applicants, a decision on whether or not to issue a visa must, in principle, be taken within 10 calendar days. This period may be extended to a maximum of 30 calendar days when further examination is required. In urgent cases, it may be reduced to two working days or less; - the amount of fees charged for processing visa applications from citizens of the European Union and Belarus shall be EUR 35. These fees shall apply to all visa applicants. In addition, the following categories of persons shall be exempt from these visa fees: children under 12 years of age, persons with disabilities, close relatives, members of official delegations; - the documents required to justify the purpose of the trip have been simplified for certain categories of applicants (e.g. close relatives, business people, members of official delegations, primary and secondary school pupils, students, persons participating in scientific, cultural and sporting events, journalists, etc.); - simplified conditions are provided for the issue of multiple-entry visas valid from 1 to 5 years to certain categories of persons (e.g. members of governments, parliaments and courts, permanent members of official delegations, spouses and children visiting European Union citizens legally residing in the territory of Belarus, or citizens of the Republic of Belarus legally residing in a Member State, persons participating in official, scientific or cultural exchange programmes or cross-border programmes, international sports events); - citizens of the European Union and citizens of Belarus holding a valid biometric diplomatic passport and holders of a valid EU laissez-passer are exempt from the visa requirement for short stays. However, the final assessment of Belarus’ system of issuance will have to be made by the Commission, in consultation with the Member States, before the conclusion of the Agreement. The importance of the fundamental principles governing the cooperation between the Parties as well as the obligations and responsibilities, including the respect of human rights and democratic principles, stemming from the relevant international instruments to which they are bound, is underlined in a preamble to the Agreement. The Parties may suspend the Agreement in whole or in part for any reason, including grounds for suspension such as breach or abuse of a provision of the Agreement, human rights and democracy considerations."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT Convention) aims, by establishing the ICCAT, to promote cooperation in maintaining the populations of tuna and tuna-like fish in the Atlantic Ocean at levels that permit the maximum sustainable catch for food and other purposes. The Convention entered into force on 21 March 1969. The Union is a party to the Convention, having approved it pursuant to the Council Decision of 9 June 1986. From 2013 to 2018, discussions took place within the ICCAT Commission on the changes that are needed to the Convention. As a result, a Protocol has been drafted to amend to the Convention. The Protocol amending ICCAT, once signed (and provisionally applied from the date of its entry into force for other Contracting Parties, pending its entry into force for the Union), must now be approved. CONTENT: the draft Council Decision seeks approval, on behalf of the Union, of the Protocol to amend the International Convention for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas. The Protocol is consistent with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Common Fisheries Policy, which provides that the Union shall: - ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the long term and are managed in a way that is consistent with the objectives of achieving economic, social and employment benefits, and of contributing to the availability of food supplies; - apply the precautionary approach to fisheries management, and is to aim to ensure that exploitation of living marine biological resources restores and maintains population of harvested species above levels which can produce the maximum sustainable yield; - adopt management and conservation measures based on best available scientific advice, to support the development of scientific knowledge and advice, to gradually eliminate discards and to promote fishing methods that contribute to more selective fishing and the avoidance and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted catches, to fishing with low impact on the marine ecosystem and fishery resources; - apply those objectives and principles in the conduct of its external fisheries relations. In accordance with the Joint Communication by the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European Commission ‘International ocean governance: an agenda for the future of oceans’6 and the Council conclusions on that Joint Communication, promoting measures to support and enhance the effectiveness of RFMOs and, where relevant, improve their governance is a central feature of the Union’s action in these fora. The Protocol meets these objectives."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the two-way carriage of passengers and goods by road between Switzerland and the EU is regulated by the Land Transport Agreement between the EU and Switzerland ('EU Agreement'). Under the EU Agreement, the transport of passengers by coach and bus between two points situated on the territory of the same Contracting Party by carriers established in the territory of the other Contracting Party, known as cabotage, is not authorised. This means that the carriers operating the passenger services which cross the border can only carry passengers across the border or within the territory of the Contracting Party they are established in. Bus and coach operators established in Switzerland may not carry passengers between two points on the German side of the border and operators established in the EU may not carry passengers between two points on the Swiss side of the border. However, Article 20(2) of the EU Agreement specifically allows pre-existing rights under bilateral agreements concluded between individual EU Member States and Switzerland that were in force at the time of conclusion of the EU Agreement to continue to be exercised. The border regions of Germany and Switzerland are closely integrated. Many Germans commute to work in Switzerland and vice versa and there is vibrant cross-border passenger traffic by road. A number of bus and coach services are offered which cross the border and thus connect the border regions of the two countries. By letter dated 11 May 2017, Germany informed the Commission that it would appreciate if the Union was to empower it to amend its bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland of 1953 with a view to authorising cabotage operations during the provision of passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border region between the two countries. Switzerland informed the Commission that it was also interested in amending this agreement to that effect. CONTENT: the proposed Decision seeks to empower Germany to amend its existing bilateral road transport agreement with Switzerland with a view to authorising cabotage operations in the respective border regions of Germany and Switzerland in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between the two countries, provided that there is no discrimination between carriers established in the Union and no distortion of competition. Cabotage operations allow increasing the load factor of the vehicles which increases the economic efficiency of the services. The authorisation of cabotage operations in the context of the provision of international passenger transport services by coach and bus in the border regions between Germany and Switzerland would allow the carriers involved to become more competitive and efficient. In order to ensure that the cabotage operations concerned do not excessively alter the functioning of the internal market for coach and bus services, as established by Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009, their authorisation should be subject to the conditions that there is no discrimination between carriers established within the Union and no distortion of competition. For the same reason, cabotage operations should only be authorised in the border regions of Germany in the course of the provision of coach and bus services between Germany and Switzerland. As border regions of Germany shall be considered the administrative districts of Freiburg and Tübingen in Baden-Württemberg and the administrative district of Swabia in Bavaria. This proposal is based on a request by Germany and concerns only this Member State. A similar request has been received by Italy which is subject to a parallel procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission’s legislative proposals on the common agricultural policy (CAP) beyond 2020 aimed to make the CAP more responsive to current and future challenges such as climate change or generational renewal, while continuing to support farmers in the Union for a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector. Those proposals are closely linked to the multiannual financial framework (MFF) of the Union for the years 2021 to 2027. The legislative procedure was not concluded in time to allow Member States and the Commission to prepare all elements necessary to apply the new legal framework and the CAP Strategic Plans as of 1 January 2021, as initially proposed by the Commission. Therefore, in order to ensure that support can be granted to farmers and other beneficiaries from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in 2021, the Union should continue to grant such support for one more year under the conditions of the existing legal framework, which covers the period 2014 to 2020. CONTENT: this proposal aims at providing certainty and continuity in the granting of support to European farmers and ensuring the continuity of support for rural development in the transitional period for those Member States that have used their 2014-2010 EAFRD allocations by extending the current legal framework until the new CAP becomes applicable. In order to allow Member States to make the necessary adaptations at national level, these changes would need to be adopted by the Council and the European Parliament by mid-2020 Extension of the applicability of the existing regulations The existing legal framework is laid down in particular in Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013, (EU) No 1305/2013, (EU) No 1306/2013, (EU) No 1307/2013, (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In addition, to facilitate the transition from existing support schemes to the new legal framework which covers the period starting on 1 January 2022, rules shall be laid down to regulate how certain support granted on a multiannual basis will be integrated into the new legal framework. In light of the fact that the Union should continue to support rural development in 2021, Member States, that demonstrate the risk to run out of funds and not to be able to undertake new legal commitments in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013, shall have the possibility to extend their rural development programmes or certain of their regional rural development programmes supported by the EAFRD to 31 December 2021 and to finance those extended programmes from the corresponding budget allocation for the year 2021. Transition to the next CAP period The new CAP comes with significant changes. Transitional rules are needed to ensure a smooth transition from the current to the next CAP period, in particular concerning the continuation of multiannual commitments undertaken in the current and previous programming periods. The Single CMO Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 lays down rules for the common organisation of agricultural markets, including aid schemes for specific sectors. It sets out the parameters for intervening on agricultural markets and providing sector-specific support. To ensure coherence, most interventions of the new CAP will be part of one strategic CAP support plan per Member State, including several sectorial interventions that have previously been set out in Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013. Under the current rules, the different sectoral programmes follow different time frames. To ensure coherence, continuity and a smooth transition between the aid schemes under Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 and the sectoral types of interventions under the new CAP it is necessary to set rules regarding the duration of each of these aid schemes with respect to the entry into application of the Member States’ CAP Strategic Plans. For aid schemes in the fruit and vegetables sector and in the olive oil and table olives sector, it is necessary to regulate the continuation and modification of operational programmes and work programmes. Budgetary implications The current Regulations (EU) No 1305/2013 on rural development and (EU) No 1307/2013 on direct payments do not lay down allocations for the transitional period (beyond calendar year 2020). Therefore, the initiative has a budgetary impact in the sense that it adds the allocations for direct payments and rural development for the relevant transitional period to ensure smooth continuity. These allocations are equal to those in the CAP Plan proposal and they are coherent with the Commission’s proposal on the MFF 2021-2027. Where Member States do not decide to prolong their current rural development programmes, the 2021 EAFRD allocations will be transferred to the 2022 – 2025 EAFRD allocations. Similarly, for the transitional period, the allocations contained in Regulations (EU) No 1308/2013, (EU) No 228/2013 and (EU) No 229/2013 need to be adjusted to respect the overall amounts for the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) included in the MFF proposal. The reserve for agricultural crises referred to in Regulation (EU) No 1306/2013 is proposed to be maintained throughout the transitional period to ensure continuity. It is to be financed through financial discipline applied on direct payments. As such, it does not entail any additional expenditure. The present proposal is neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments. The impact as regards the estimated schedule for payment appropriations will depend on Member States decisions as regards the prolongation of the current rural development programmes. Similarly, any decision of Member States to transfer funds between direct payments and rural development will be neutral in terms of overall budgetary commitments but may have an impact in terms of timing of payments that however cannot be estimated."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the consequences of the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic for farmers and rural businesses are unprecedented. Mandatory closures of shops, outdoor markets, restaurants and other similar establishments have led to economic disruption to the agricultural sector and rural communities and led to liquidity and cash-flow problems for farmers and small rural businesses active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. As a consequence, certain small businesses and farmers are in urgent need of emergency support in order to maintain their activities. The support will need to be in the form of a temporary aid, for a very targeted purpose in unprecendented circumstances. CONTENT: the proposal includes limited and targeted amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1305/2013 providing exceptional and temporary support to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products, which are particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Exceptional temporary support Support under this measure shall consist of temporary emergency aid to farmers and SMEs particularly affected by the COVID-19 crisis to ensure the continuity of their activities. It shall consist of a one-off lump sum payment to farmers and SMEs active in processing, marketing and/or development of agricultural products. Payments by the Commission shall be made in accordance with budget appropriations and subject to available funding. The maximum amount of support shall not exceed EUR 5 000 per farmer and EUR 50 000 per SME. With a view to ensuring the most efficient use of resources available under existing rural development programmes, Member States shall be required to substantiate the targeting of the support to those most affected, based on objective and non-discriminatory criteria. When granting support, Member States shall take into account the support granted under other national or Union support instruments or private schemes to respond to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The EAFRD support provided shall be limited to a maximum of 1% of the total EAFRD contribution to the rural development programme. Budgetary implications This new proposal does not imply any changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) annual ceilings for commitments and payments as per Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 1311/2013. The total annual breakdown of commitment appropriations under European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) remains unchanged. Overall, this measure does not imply the need for extra payment appropriations. The 2021 payment appropriations needed to finance this measure will be offset by lower payment needs in subsequent years."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe and the European Community entered into force on 29 August 20112 and has since been renewed automatically. The previous Protocol to the Agreement, which entered into force on 23 May 2014, expired on 22 May 2018. The evaluation report concluded that the Union’s tuna fishing sector has a strong interest in fishing in São Tomé and Príncipe and that a renewal of the Protocol would help strengthen monitoring, control and surveillance and contribute to improved governance of the fisheries in the region. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe with a view to concluding a new Protocol to the Agreement. Following these negotiations, a new Protocol was initialled on 17 April 2019. The Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of its provisional application, i.e. from the date on which it is signed. The negotiation of a new protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with São Tomé and Príncipe forms part of the Union’s external action in relation to countries in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States and takes into account, in particular, Union objectives on respecting democratic principles and human rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Protocol on the implementation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe and the European Community. Objectives of the proposal The objective of the Protocol is to enable the Union and São Tomé and Príncipe to work more closely on promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in São Tomé and Príncipe waters and to support efforts by São Tomé and Príncipe to develop its fisheries sector. Fishing opportunities In accordance with the priorities of the Fisheries Policy reform, the new Protocol provides fishing opportunities for Union vessels in São Tomé and Príncipe waters, on the basis of the best available scientific advice and following the recommendations of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: (a) 28 freezer tuna seiners; (b) 6 surface longliners. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 840 000, based on: - a reference tonnage of 8 000 tonnes per year, for which an amount linked to access has been set at EUR 400 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol; - support for the development of São Tomé and Príncipe’s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 440 000 per year for the entire duration of the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of São Tomé and Príncipe’s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The Commission is authorised to approve, on behalf of the Union, amendments to the Protocol to be adopted by the Joint Committee established under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement."

In line with the recommendation made by the Committee on International Trade, the European Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement. Some years ago when Switzerland was faced with a sharp increase in meat imports, including ‘seasoned meat’, the Swiss Parliament adopted a motion at the end of 2015 to reclassify certain ‘seasoned meat’, which led to a sharp increase in customs duties for the products in question. In 2017, the EU challenged this measure at the WTO, alleging its incompatibility with WTO rules. In April 2018, Switzerland agreed that it had to compensate for the increase of tariff and launched a negotiation procedure under Article XXVIII of the GATT in order to modify the tariff concessions in its schedule for the ‘meat not further prepared than seasoned’. At the end of 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate compensation. Switzerland proposed to increase its WTO tariff rate quota for beef by 1 200 tonnes as compensation. Within this tariff quota, Switzerland committed itself in particular to allocate a specific sub-quota of 600 tonnes for ‘seasoned meat’. A new tariff line has been created for this purpose. Switzerland also maintains the previously agreed reduced duty for beef imported for the purposes of processing into dry meat. A draft agreement was initialled in July 2019. On 24 October, the Council adopted a decision on the signing of the agreement, which was signed on 9 December 2019 in Brussels. By exchange of letters, the EU and Switzerland agreed on the amendments to be incorporated in the Swiss schedule of commitments: new tariffs (including for dry beef meat) and the increased tariff quota from 22 500 tonnes (current) to 23 700 tonnes."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the EU, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: air services between the European Union and Jordan presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Jordan. The conclusion of a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Jordan has been a priority for the EU and is an important element in the development of the European Neighbourhood Policy. The negotiating mandate received from the Council in June 2007 set the objective of establishing a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU and Jordan. This would extend the rules and provisions of the single market for air transport in the EU to a large extent to Jordan in which European and Jordanian air carriers would be able to provide air services without any restriction. Based on the negotiating directives of the mandate, a draft Agreement with Jordan was initialled by the two sides on 17 March 2010. LEGAL BASE: Article 207 (5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2), (5), (6) and (7) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: a report prepared for the Commission in 2008 by consultants, estimated that an Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement with Jordan would generate 54,000 extra passengers and consumer benefits of up to EUR 30 million in the first effective year of market opening. CONTENT: the Euro Mediterranean Aviation Agreement between the EU and its Member States, and Jordan has been negotiated under a mandate. By establishing a Euro Mediterranean Aviation Area, the Agreement will extend EU legislation in the field of aviation to Jordan. In particular, Jordan will take over EU legislation in important fields such as safety, security and air traffic management. The Agreement will replace the existing arrangements made by individual Member States. It creates simultaneously for all Union air carriers uniform conditions for market access, and establishes new arrangements for regulatory co-operation between the EU and Jordan in fields essential for the safe, secure, and efficient operation of air services. These arrangements can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. The Agreement allows for the simultaneous extension of its terms to the 27 Member States, applying the same rules without discrimination and benefiting all Union air carriers regardless of their nationality. These carriers can now operate freely from any point in the EU to any point in Jordan which is currently not the case. Removal of all market access restrictions between the EU and Jordan will not only attract new entrants to the market and create opportunities to operate to underserved airports, but will also facilitate consolidation between EU air carriers. The Agreement secures for all EU air carriers access to commercial opportunities, such as the possibility of freely establishing prices. One further objective of the mandate is to create a level playing field between all EU and Jordanian air carriers, and this requires strong regulatory co-operation which can only be delivered at Union level. The Agreement aims at: gradual market opening in terms of access to routes and capacity on a reciprocal basis; non-discrimination and level playing field for economic operators based on the principles of the EU Treaties; alignment of the Jordanian aviation legislation with EU legislation on issues such as safety, security and air traffic management; the possibility of extending the Agreement in order to create with all the other Mediterranean Partners a Common Euro Mediterranean Aviation Area. The Agreement consists of the main body including the main principles, and three annexes: Annex 1 on traffic rights, Annex 2 on transitional provisions and Annex 3 including the EU aviation legislation to be taken over by Jordan. Lastly, it establishes a Joint Committee which will be responsible for reviewing the implementation of the Agreement and its effects. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Union budget."

BACKGROUND : the Common Aviation Area Agreement between the EU and its Member States, of the one part, and Georgia, of the other part has been negotiated under a mandate received from the Council in June 2009. Air services between the EU and Georgia presently operate on the basis of bilateral agreements between individual Member States and Georgia. It is part of the EU neighbourhood policy to replace this network of bilateral agreements through the establishment of a Common Aviation Area between the EU and its neighbours. The negotiating mandate set the objective of establishing a Common Aviation Area (CAA) between the EU and Georgia.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: The European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits and EU type-approval procedures for engines for non-road mobile machinery. It sets new emissions limits, referred to as ‘Stage V’, which are designed to reduce the current emissions of air pollutants from engines for non-road mobile machinery. Given the structural challenge for certain manufactures to shift towards Stage V emission limits, the Regulation provides some lead time to make this transition. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components, which has led to delays for engines and machinery fitted with those engines that comply with less stringent emission limits than those of Stage V and that need to be placed on the market before the dates set out in Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. In view of this exceptional situation, it is likely that manufacturers of non-road mobile machinery will not be able to ensure that engines and engine-equipped machinery benefiting from the transitional period will meet the deadlines set without suffering serious economic damage. It is therefore necessary to modify the dates of application of certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 outbreak, an extension of twelve months for the manufacture and placing on the market of transition engines and the machinery equipped with them. This proposal has no environmental effects since the measures facilitate the placing in the market of goods fitted with engines produced before the pandemic. It also avoids the need to scrap otherwise non-compliant goods fitted with such engines The Commission considers that the extension of 12 months is justified given the seasonal nature of the goods in which transition engines will be fitted. This is particularly the case for tractors and garden equipment. In addition, it is difficult to predict the exact duration of the delays that will be suffered for the completion of the impacted goods (e.g. inland waterways vessels). In view of the fact that the transition period provided for in Article 58(5) of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for certain engines will expire on 31 December 2020 and that manufacturers have until 30 June 2020 to produce transition engines, this Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU legislation requires that applications for marketing authorisation for a medicinal product, in a Member State or in the Union, be accompanied by a dossier containing the results of clinical trials carried out on the product. Sponsors are required, before the commencement of any clinical trial, to request authorisation from the competent authority of the Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Clinical trials necessitate the performance of multiple operations which may fall within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC (Directive on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms) or Directive 2009/41/EC (Directive on the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms) in cases where the investigational medicinal product contains or consists of GMOs. Experience shows that, in clinical trials with investigational medicinal products containing or consisting of GMOs, the procedure to achieve compliance with the requirements of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC as regards the environmental impact assessment and authorisation by the competent authority of a Member State is complex and may take a significant amount of time. The complexity of that procedure increases greatly in the case of multi-centre clinical trials conducted in several Member States, as sponsors of clinical trials need to submit multiple requests for authorisation to multiple competent authorities in different Member States in parallel. The Commission considers that it is of paramount importance that clinical trials with investigational medicinal products against COVID-19 containing or consisting of GMOs can be conducted within the Union, that they can begin as soon as possible, and that they are not delayed due to the complexity of differing national procedures put in place by Member States in implementation of Directives 2001/18/EC and 2009/41/EC. CONTENT: in the public health emergency created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the proposed Regulation aims to ensure that clinical trials with medicinal products for human use containing or consisting of GMOs to treat or prevent COVID-19 can start swiftly and without a prior environmental risk assessment and/or prior consent under Directive 2001/18/EC or Directive 2009/41/EC. The Regulation shall apply for as long as COVID-19 is considered a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) or declared an emergency situation in accordance with Decision No 1082/2013/EU and remains so."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down common rules and general rules applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds. The general budget of the Union for the financial year 2020 amended the total amount of resources for the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) by increasing the commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI in 2020 by EUR 28 333 334 in current prices and by increasing the total amount of commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI for the entire programming period to EUR 4 556 215 406 in current prices. For 2020, the additional resources of EUR 23.7 million in 2011 prices shall be financed by the global margin for commitments within the margin of the multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020. The Commission considers that there is an urgent need to amend the YEI support programmes in order to include the additional resources allocated to the specific allocation for the YEI before the end of 2020. It has explored the scope for manoeuvre provided by the legal framework and considers it necessary to propose amendments to Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. CONTENT: in line with the adopted budget for 2020, the Commission proposes to increase the commitment appropriations for the specific allocation for the YEI by EUR 28 333 334 in current prices, bringing the total amount for 2020 to EUR 145 million in current prices. The proposal further specifies that the relevant provisions that have been introduced to facilitate the programming of the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2019 shall also apply to the additional resources allocated to the YEI in 2020. The proposed amendment is estimated to result in additional payments of EUR 3 million in 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Member States have been affected in a dramatic and exceptional way by the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of restrictive measures were taken to stop or slow down the transmission of COVID-19, including lockdown measures to restrict the free movement of their citizens, the prohibition of public events, and the closure of shops, restaurants and schools. These measures have inevitably also had a serious impact on European citizens’ initiatives (ECIs), a participative democracy instrument that depends on the engagement of citizens across the EU. The national confinement measures and more generally the omnipresence of the pandemic make it currently nearly impossible for organisers to successfully continue their local campaigning activities and the collection of paper statements of support to help them gather the required statements within the set period of 12 months. Member States and the European institutions have also certain obligations as regards the verification (including certification) of the validity of the collected statements of support and the examination of a successful initiative. These obligations are equally time-bound. Due to the exceptional circumstances, these obligations may not be able to be respected within the set legal time limits. CONTENT: this proposal lays down temporary measures concerning the time limits for the collection, verification and examination stages provided for in Regulation (EU) 2019/788 on the European citizens' initiative in view of the COVID-19 outbreak. Collection period In order to preserve the efficacy of the European citizens’ initiative instrument during this pandemic and to provide reassurance and legal clarity to organisers of initiatives the collection, verification or examination of which is ongoing, the Commission proposes to adopt temporary measures to extend by 6 months the current 12-month period for initiatives whose signature collection was ongoing on 11 March 2020, the date on which the COVID-19 epidemic was qualified as a pandemic by the WHO. That extension is based on the assumption that at least in the first six months since 11 March 2020 a majority of Member States or a number of Member States representing more than 35% of the Union population will have measures in place that will substantially hamper the organisers’ possibilities to carry out local campaigning and collect paper statements of support. Where the collection period of an initiative started after 11 March, that period should be extended proportionately. Verification period Similar temporary measures should be taken to allow Member States to request the European Commission for an extension of the verification period in case their competent authorities due to the measures taken to combat the pandemic cannot complete the verification in time. The measures are temporary in nature, as these only apply until end 2022. Examination period The examination period is also subject to specific time limits. The European institutions are required to organise a meeting with the organisers (to be organised by the Commission within one month after submission of a successful initiative) and a public hearing (to be organised by the European Parliament within three months after submission). The organisation of such events may be difficult within the time limits set by Regulation (EU) 2019/788. In such a case, the European institutions should be allowed to organise such events as soon as the public health situation in that country again allows for organising such events. In such cases, the European Commission shall adopt its Communication in response to a valid initiative within three months after the public hearing in the European Parliament. Lastly, this proposed Regulation should be adopted as a matter of urgency, so that situations of legal uncertainty affecting citizens, organisers, national administrations and the Union institutions, in particular where the relevant time periods for the collection of statements of support, verification and examination in respect of a number of initiatives have already ended or are about to end, remain as short as possible. It should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic brought about a significant drop in demand which in turn has led to a sharp drop in rail transport. Demand for both passenger and freight services for the whole of 2020 is expected to be well below 2019 levels. The pandemic may lead to a large number of insolvencies and liquidity shortages within the railway sector. It affects all the supply chain and has effects on railway undertakings, shippers and logistic enterprises. Infrastructure managers and service facility operators will also suffer from its financial consequences. The rail sector makes a vital contribution to the European economy as a whole and to employment, directly employing more than 1 million people, of whom around 600 000 are employed in railway undertakings and 440 000 in infrastructure managers (by the end of 2016). Rail transport is also a key element of the EU's strategy to improve the sustainability of the transport sector, ensure economic and social cohesion and connecting Europeans within and between Member States. Directive 2012/34/EU establishing a Single European Railway Area does not allow Member States, in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, to respond to the unpredictable effects on rail transport by adapting, in particular, the rules on charging and capacity allocation. Targeted derogations should therefore be allowed in order to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on rail transport and to preserve the integrity of the single European railway area. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation is intended to complete the existing rail-related framework in order to allow national authorities and rail stakeholders to deal more easily with a number of negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to respond to the urgent needs of the railway sector as long as those consequences persist. These temporary emergency measures concern notably the waiver, reduction or deferral of track access charges for the use of rail infrastructure, as well as the waiver of reservation charges. They cover a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020, in respect of which charges may be altered, by derogation from Article 27 of Directive 2012/34/EU whereby the network statement (displaying all applicable charges) shall be published no less than for months in advance for the deadline for requests for infrastructure capacity. Income losses on the part of infrastructure managers as a result of the reductions envisaged in the proposed Regulation shall be reimbursed by Member States by 31 December of the year following the year in which the loss was incurred at the latest.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. To ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link, it would be beneficial to retain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single safety authority responsible for the whole of this infrastructure. To this end, it is necessary to adapt Directive (EU) 2016/798. In a parallel and related initiative, the Commission also proposes the adoption of a decision of the European Parliament and Council empowering France to negotiate and conclude under certain conditions an international agreement that would maintain the Intergovernmental Commission as the single national safety authority for the Channel Fixed Link. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Article 3(7) of Directive (EU) 2016/798, which defines the concept of ‘national safety authority’ for the purposes of both railway safety under that Directive and railway interoperability under Directive (EU) 2016/797. Specifically, the proposal shall: - allow a body entrusted by a Member State and a third country with the tasks regarding railway safety and interoperability on the basis of an international agreement concluded or authorised by the EU to be considered as a national safety authority under Union law; - provide that, where necessary for reasons of railway safety, the Member State concerned should make use without delay of the right afforded by the agreement with the third country concerned, whereby the national safety authority is entitled to assume sole competence over the part of the rail infrastructure situated in that Member State; - provide that the European Court of Justice would have jurisdiction to give a ruling at the request of an arbitration tribunal set up by an international agreement such as the one that France should be empowered to negotiate and conclude with the United Kingdom."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by concessionnaires of a Channel Fixed Link, signed at Canterbury on 12 February 1986 established an Intergovernmental Commission to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transitional period set out in the agreement on the withdrawal of the UK from the EU, the Intergovernmental Commission shall constitute a body established by a Member State and a third country and shall therefore cease to be the national safety authority within the meaning of the EU Railway Safety Directive 2016/798 for the Channel Fixed Link. From the same date, EU law shall no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. Considering the special position of the Channel Fixed Link as a railway link involving a single, complex engineering structure situated partly in the territory of France and of a third country respectively, it is appropriate to authorise France to enter into an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link in order to maintain a unified safety regime in the whole Tunnel, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. To this end, a proposal for a Regulation amending Directive (EU) 2016/798 on railway safety is also being presented in parallel by the Commission. CONTENT: following a request submitted by France on 16 July 2020, this proposal aims to authorise France to negotiate an international agreement supplementing the Treaty of Canterbury with the United Kingdom to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the Channel Fixed Link by maintaining a single safety authority responsible for the whole infrastructure, and to define the specific requirements that the proposed agreement must meet, such as the obligation for the Intergovernmental Commission to apply EU rules on railway safety and interoperability. The Intergovernmental Commission established by the Treaty of Canterbury shall therefore remain the single safety authority and shall continue to apply Union rules on railway safety. The aim is to ensure that the Intergovernmental Commission applies Union law on the whole of the Channel Fixed Link, including in its section under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a new regulatory framework as regards organic production. It provides for an application date of 1 January 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and the related public health crisis is placing a heavy burden on national authorities and organic operators. The pandemic has also created extraordinary circumstances that require considerable adaptation of the organic sector in terms of production, marketing, controls and international trade. Due to these extraordinary circumstances, it is very likely that Member States and organic operators will not be ready to ensure the proper implementation and application of Regulation (EU) 2018/848 from 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market, to provide legal certainty to all organic operators, and to avoid potential market disruption, the Commission proposes to defer the date of application of certain provisions of Regulation (EU) 2018/848 by one year (until 1 January 2022) and certain other dates referred to in that Regulation that are derived from that date. The proposed amendments aim to ensure that the intended purpose of Regulation (EU) 2018/848, that is to achieve: - the establishment of a framework for organic production, with the goal of developing further an overall system of farm management and food production that combines best environmental and climate action practices; - a high level of biodiversity; - the preservation of natural resources and the application of high animal welfare standards and high production standards in line with the demand of a growing number of consumers for products using natural substances and processes."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak has caused a disruption of the supply chain of critical parts and components for L-category vehicles and a sizeable drop in demand for those vehicles. This has led to important delays for manufacturers to clear their stock of Euro 4 vehicles that, according to Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, need to be registered before the application of the environmental Euro 5 step on 1 January 2021. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, motorcycles sales have been highly impacted. Because of Member States authorities’ lockdowns, sales could not take place during the peak season. According to industry sources, it is estimated that around 553 700 Euro 4 vehicles were in stock in March 2020. During the lockdowns, sales went down by 98% and remained sluggish since then. It is therefore likely that not all Euro 4 vehicles currently in stock will be sold by the end of the year. The end-of-series provisions set out in Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 allow manufacturers to continue to make available on the market, register or enter into service a limited part of a stock of L-category vehicles which cannot be made available on the market or can no longer be made available on the market, owing to the entry into force of new technical requirements against which those vehicles have not been approved. Considering the disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, it is apparent that the provisions on end-of-series do not constitute an appropriate mechanism to address the amount of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that manufacturers will have in stock following the application of the environmental Euro 5 step. CONTENT: in the context of the current COVID-19 epidemic, the main purpose of the proposal amending Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 is to adapt the provisions relating to the number of end-of-series vehicles in order to allow dealers to sell higher amounts of their stock of Euro 4 vehicles in 2021 only. In order to ensure that the application of these measures is restricted to vehicles that were in stock at the moment of the national lockdowns, the amount of vehicles benefiting from these specific end-of-series measures shall not exceed the number of Euro 4 L-category vehicles that were in stock on 15 March 2020. This proposal: - shall not increase pollutant emissions as the flexibility shall be limited to already produced vehicles at the time of the lockdown; - avoid the need to unnecessarily scrap vehicles that would have been otherwise placed on the market in absence of the crisis; - shall not postpone the entry into force of the Euro 5 step for all newly produced vehicles on 1 January 2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: at its meeting in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000, the European Council stated that Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the Western Balkan entities should be preceded by asymmetrical trade liberalisation. By introducing exceptional trade measures in favour of the countries and territories participating in the Stabilisation and Association Process, Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, which applies until 31 December 2020, has allowed such liberalisation. Stabilisation and Association Agreements have now been concluded with all six relevant entities of the Western Balkans, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia. Even though most of the trade preferences initially granted to the Western Balkans through the autonomous trade regime have now been integrated in their respective Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the Union, the limited preferences granted through this Regulation still provide a valuable support to the regional economy. These preferences allow for the suspension of the specific duties normally applied to fruits and vegetables and for the inclusion of a global wine quota available after exhaustion of the countries’ respective national wine quotas. The ATMs system contributed to the expansion of the total trade between the EU and the Western Balkans which exceeded EUR 54 billion in 2018. The EU is the leading trade partner accounting for over 72% of the region's total trade. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the period of application of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 until 31 December 2025. The proposed measures have been in place for almost 20 years, but are now considerably reduced, as most of the preferences have been gradually integrated into the various Stabilisation and Association Agreements concluded between the EU and the beneficiaries. While the estimated impact is considered minimal in terms of loss of customs duties for the EU - around EUR 23.5 million for all six beneficiaries, based on the import value in 2018 - the extension of the measures is considered the best guarantee of the EU's commitment to the trade integration of the Western Balkans. It would also help to ensure stable market access conditions for economic operators both in the region and in the EU. The unilateral preferences to Kosovo were included in the EU-Kosovo Stabilisation and Association Agreement, which entered into force on 1 April 2016. The autonomous trade preferences do no longer concern any fishery or beef trade concessions. It is therefore proposed to remove any references to these two categories of products. This proposal is consistent with the political guidelines of the new Commission, which has reaffirmed the European perspective of the Western Balkans and its important role in the continued reform process across the region. The European Union aims to promote peace, stability and economic development in the region and open up the prospect of EU integration. Budgetary implications The proposed Regulation does not incur additional costs in the EU budget. For the years 2020 to 2025 there will be no additional tariff revenue foregone in respect of products produced by the current beneficiaries. Hypothetical revenue that could have been collected from additional new imports is not considered as a loss of tariff revenue."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between the European Union and Seychelles was signed on 28 February 2007 and entered into force on 2 November 2007 for a duration of six years. The agreement is tacitly renewable, and is therefore still in force. The current 6-year Protocol to the FPA entered into application on 18th January 2014 and will expire on 17th January 2020. On the basis of the relevant negotiating directives, the Commission conducted negotiations with the Seychelles with a view to concluding, on behalf of the European Union, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and its Implementing Protocol (2020-2026). At the end of the negotiations, an Agreement and Protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 22 October 2019. The new Agreement repeals and replaces the existing Agreement; it covers a period of six years as does the new Protocol. The purpose of this proposal is to authorise the conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol CONTENT: the main aim of the new Agreement is to provide an updated framework taking into account the priorities of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy and its external dimension, with a view to continuing and reinforcing the strategic partnership between the European Union and the Seychelles in the field of fisheries. The aim of the Implementing Protocol is to grant fishing opportunities to European Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone in accordance with the best available scientific advice and the resolutions and recommendations of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), within the limits of the available surplus. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the European Union and the Republic of Seychelles to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone and in the Indian Ocean, in the interest of both parties. In addition, this cooperation will also contribute to promote decent working conditions in fisheries activities. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 40 tuna purse seine vessels; - 8 surface longliners; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant IOTC resolutions. The conclusion of the Agreement and its Implementing Protocol enables to continue and reinforce the strategic fisheries partnership between the European Union and Seychelles. It will create fishing opportunities for Union vessels in the Seychelles fishing zone. It will also contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the Fisheries Comprehensive Plan, the monitoring and combating illegal fishing, and the support for the small-scale fisheries sector. Lastly, the Agreement and the Protocol will contribute to Seychelles’ sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and to Seychelles’ fishing economy by promoting growth and decent working conditions, associated with fishing-related economic activities. Budgetary implications The EU annual financial contribution is EUR 5 300 000, based on: - an annual amount for access to the fisheries resources in the Seychelles fishing zone of EUR 2 500 000 equivalent to a reference tonnage, for highly migratory species, of 50 000 tonnes per year; - support for development of the sectoral fisheries policy of the Seychelles, amounting to EUR 2 800 000 per year. This support meets the objectives of Seychelles’ Fisheries Comprehensive Plan. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure, including for the reserve line for protocols not having entered into force at the beginning of the year."

BACKGROUND: on 10 September 2010, the Council authorised the opening of negotiations with China with a view to reaching a broad and ambitious agreement on cooperation on geographical indications and their protection. The conclusion of the Agreement is part of the EU’s overall strategy to promote the EU’s policy on geographical indications.

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Baltic Sea ecosystem has been fragile for decades. However, it was only in 2019 that the scientists warned about the impact of environmental conditions on Eastern Baltic cod. This situation is leading to a steep decline in this species and even in the total absence of fishing activities, the Eastern Baltic cod stock is not expected to recover until 2024. Therefore given the above situation, this year, acting upon the best available scientific advice and in accordance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy and the Multiannual Plan for the Baltic Sea established by Regulation (EU) 2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Commission adopted first emergency measures in July 2019 prohibiting the fishing of Eastern Baltic cod until year-end; and secondly, the Council decided in October 2019 on necessary and unprecedented fishing restrictions for 2020. Commission analysis shows that the fleet segments with the highest dependency on Eastern Baltic cod encompass more than 300 vessels, mainly trawlers and netters in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, and to a lesser extent Denmark. These fleet segments are of significant socioeconomic importance, representing between roughly 20% and 50% of the respective national fleet in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland, expressed in full-time equivalents. Of these, only a minority seem resilient enough to survive a short-term – but not a medium or long-term – closure. The Commission has therefore concluded that urgent measures are needed in this sector. Support for the permanent cessation of activities through ship scrapping has been granted until the end of 2017 under the European Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Fund (EAMF) established by Regulation (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council. This proposal would reintroduce this measure, under new and strict conditions, for the Eastern Baltic cod fleet until the end of the current FEAMP period (2014-2020). CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulations (EU) 2016/1139 and (EU) No 508/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council provides the following: Financial assistance of the EMFF The proposal aims to allow Member States affected by the exceptional situation of Eastern Baltic cod to grant financial support for achieving and maintaining a balance between the fleet capacity and the fishing opportunities by making financial support for permanent cessation of fishing activities through scrapping eligible under the EMFF 2014-2022. These Member States would have the possibility to redirect available appropriations for storage aid and Integrated Maritime Policy inside the financial envelope of each Member State to the permanent cessation of fishing activities with a view to reinforce the need to scrap vessels, while at the same time not negatively impacting the achievements of other CFP objectives and the implementation of the EMFF. Aid for the permanent cessation of fishing activities shall only be granted for the scrapping of fishing vessels. It shall not be granted for the retroffiting of fishing vessels for activities other than commercial fishing, such as recreational fishing, that have a detrimental impact on the ecosystem. Reduction capacity According to ICES advice, approximately 70% of the cod landings in subdivisions 24-28 were taken by trawlers with a BACOMA with a 120 mm escape window or T90, and 15% of the cod landings were taken by gillnetters with mesh sizes between 110 mm and 156 mm. Under this proposal, the Member State capacity level of these two fleet segments shall be capped at levels of active vessels in the most recent years before the application of emergency measures, i.e. 2017 and 2018, and shall be reduced when vessels are withdrawn with public aid, with the aim of rebuilding the stock of Eastern Baltic cod. Monitoring of cod catches Given the serious condition of the Eastern Baltic cod stock additional measures to control the fisheries catching Eastern Baltic cod should be introduced. The threshold quantity as of which a fishing vessel is required to land its catch in a specific place should be reduced to 250kg. Masters of fishing vessels having quotas for cod and fishing in areas where Eastern Baltic cod is present are to ensure that their fishing activity can be monitored at any time by the national competent authorities. From 2020 onwards, vessels fishing for cod in the Eastern Baltic shall be equipped with a satellite-based vessel monitoring system (VMS) or other equivalent electronic monitoring system. In order to improve data collection, the observer coverage shall reach at least 20% for vessels catching Eastern Baltic cod."

It also aims at giving the PES more opportunities to help develop innovative, evidence-based policies in line with relevant Union policy initiatives. The Network has been key in encouraging further cooperation between the Member States within the areas of PES responsibility as well as contributing to the modernisation and strengthening of the PES. An evaluation of the state of implementation of Decision No 573/2014/EU shows that the Network has had a positive impact and identifies lessons learned on the basis of the different activities and experiences. Therefore, in order to capitalise on the results achieved so far and further foster cooperation between PES, the period of establishment of the Network should be prolonged until 31 December 2027. CONTENT: this proposal aims at continuing to reinforce PES capacity, effectiveness and efficiency through providing a platform for comparing their performance at European level, identifying good practices and developing a mutual learning system. It also aims at giving the PES more opportunities to help develop innovative, evidence-based policies. The objective of the proposal amending Decision No 573/2014/EU is therefore to build upon the positive achievement of the Network demonstrated in the findings of this evaluation while answering the needs and strong support of the Network stakeholders to continue implementing this valuable cooperation beyond 2020. It thereby aims to extend the period of establishment of the Network until 31 December 2027. The continuation of the Network should support the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which includes the provision of active support to employment among its principles. It should also contribute to sustainable development goal 8 of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by contributing to inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all. Enhanced cooperation The Network shall develop cooperation with relevant labour market stakeholders including other providers of employment services, and where appropriate, EU Agencies in the area of employment, social policy and education and training, social partners, organisations representing unemployed persons or vulnerable groups, NGOs working in the field of employment, and regional and local authorities, by involving them in relevant activities and meetings of the Network and by exchanging information and data with them. Financial support The global resources for the implementation of this Decision shall be made available in accordance with the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 as appropriate, the annual appropriations of which shall be authorised by the European Parliament and by the Council within the limits of the financial framework. Review and application By September 2026, the Commission shall submit an evaluation on the application of this Decision. In order to ensure a seamless continuation of the activities of the Network, this Decision should apply from 1 January 2021."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009 establishes a common system for the control of exports of dual-use items in accordance with the international commitments and obligations of the Member States and the EU. Under this regulation, an authorisation is required for the export of dual-use items to third countries. This authorisation may take the form of an individual, global or general authorisation. In particular, Annex IIa to the Regulation provides for a Union General Export Authorisation (“EU001”) for certain low-risk transactions, e.g. exports to Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland (incl. Liechtenstein), and the United States of America. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU has consequences for trade in dual-use items between the EU and the UK: under Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009, the export of dual-use items from the EU to the UK will, as from 1 January 2021, require an export authorisation issued by the national competent authority of the Member State where the exporter is established. This would create a considerable administrative burden for the competent authorities of the Member States and for EU exporters, which would be detrimental to their competitiveness. CONTENT: in order to avoid disproportionate trade disruptions and an excessive administrative burden for exports of dual-use items from the EU to the UK, it is proposed to add the UK to Annex IIa of the Regulation and thus to control exports to the UK under EU General Export Authorisation No EU001. The addition of the United Kingdom to the list of countries covered by EU General Export Authorisation EU001 should not have a negative impact on EU and international security, while ensuring uniform and consistent application of controls throughout the Union and ensuring a level playing field for EU exporters. This proposal is consistent with the general approach to contingency measures to address a withdrawal of the United Kingdom without agreement."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the US have a close trade and investment relationship. Bilateral trade in goods and services between them amounts to more than EUR 1000 billion per year, or EUR 3 billion per day. On 21 August 2020 Commissioner Hogan and US Trade Representative Lighthizer stated their intention to go ahead with a trade-facilitating package to eliminate or reduce customs duties for a small number of tariff lines covering EUR 168 million (approximatively USD 200 million) in EU and US exports. The Commission therefore proposes to create additional opportunities for EU and US operators by eliminating or reducing tariffs. It sees this initiative as a first step to de-escalate bilateral trade tensions and to support the settlement of on-going disputes. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to eliminate a number of customs tariffs on lobster. Lobster is not sensitive products for the EU, which is a net importer of these products. EU producers supply less than 5% of European consumption. The elimination of import duties shall support the food-processing industry and the hospitality sector. In return, the US has committed to ease market access for EU27 exports worth EUR 143 million (USD 160 million) on average in the past three years, through a 50% reduction of duties. These include products such as prepared meals, certain crystal glassware, surface preparations, propellant powders, cigarette lighters and lighter parts. The US requested the tariff reduction for lobster in light of its declining exports of the product to Europe and the world. The tariff reductions should be implemented in a fully WTO consistent manner and respect the most-favoured nation (MFN) principle. The measures shall apply retroactively as of 1 August 2020 and end on 31 July 2025. The agreement shall have a limited negative impact on the budget of the EU in the form of foregone customs duties due to tariff liberalisation for the products covered by the tariff lines in annex to this Regulation, representing some EUR 5.3 million in duties collected from the US (average 2017-2019 period)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Treaty between France and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland concerning the construction and operation by private concessionaries of a Channel fixed link, signed in Canterbury on 12 February 1986, established an intergovernmental committee to supervise all matters concerning the construction and operation of the Channel Fixed Link. After the end of the transition period set out in the withdrawal agreement, unless otherwise provided, EU law will no longer be applicable to the part of the Channel Fixed Link under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom and, as regards the part of the Channel Fixed Link under French jurisdiction, the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be a national safety authority under Union law. The safety authorisations for the Channel Fixed Link infrastructure manager and safety certificates for railway undertakings operating through the Fixed Link issued by the Intergovernmental Commission will no longer be valid. By Decision (EU) 2020/1531 of the European Parliament and of the Council, France was empowered to negotiate, sign and conclude an international agreement with the United Kingdom regarding the application of the railway safety and interoperability rules of the Union to the Channel Fixed Link, with the aim of maintaining a unified safety regime. However, it is unlikely that such agreement will enter into force by the end of the transition period. In the light of the economic importance of the Channel Fixed Link to the EU, it is essential that the Channel Fixed Link continue to operate after 1 January 2021. CONTENT: in view of the end of the transitional period referred to in the withdrawal agreement, the proposed Regulation lays down transitional provisions for certain safety certificates and safety approvals issued under Directive 2004/49/EC and for certain licences of railway undertakings issued under Directive 2012/34/EU. In concrete terms, the proposal: - extends the validity of safety authorisations of the infrastructure manager by two months and the validity of safety certificates and licences of railway undertakings by nine months; - also extends by nine months the validity of the operating licences issued by the United Kingdom under Directive 2012/34/EU in order to allow railway undertakings to continue to operate up to the Calais-Fréthun border-crossing station and thus ensure connectivity between the Union and the United Kingdom; - provides that such authorisations, certificates and licences are subject to Directive (EU) 2016/798 and Directive 2012/34/EU respectively and requires their holders of to cooperate with the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority and provide the necessary information; the French National Safety Authority and licensing authority must monitor that the holders of these authorisations, certificates and licences comply with EU law; - confers implementing powers on the Commission to withdraw the benefit conferred on the holders of the approvals/certificates and licences in question, where compliance with EU requirements is not ensured."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC), to which the Union has been a contracting party since 2006, is the regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) responsible for the management of resources of tuna and tuna-like species in the Eastern Pacific Ocean, established by the Convention for the Strengthening of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission established by the 1949 Convention between the United States of America and the Republic of Costa Rica (the IATTC Convention). The IATTC is empowered to adopt decisions (resolutions) to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the IATTC Convention Area. IATTC resolutions are binding on the Contracting Parties. They also impose obligations on private operators (e.g. vessel masters). The EU has an average of three purse-seiners and thirty-some longliners operating in the IATTC Convention area. The main stocks targeted by the EU fleet are tropical tunas and swordfish. The provisions of some IATTC Resolutions were last transposed through Title IV of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 of 7 May 2007 laying down technical measures for the conservation of certain stocks of highly migratory species. The proposal aims to take into account changes that have occurred since the adoption of that Regulation but which have not yet been covered by EU law. CONTENT: the proposal for amendment of Council Regulation (EC) No 520/2007 lays down management, conservation and control measures relating to fishing in the IATTC Convention Area and for stocks of tuna and tuna-like species, other species of fish caught by vessels fishing for tuna and tuna-like species and species belonging to the same ecosystem. The Regulation shall apply to EU vessels fishing in the IATTC Convention area. The proposed Regulation: - deals with conservation and management measures, including provisions relevant to purse-seine vessels fishing for tropical tuna, prohibition of fishing on data buoys, provisions concerning fishing in the vicinity of Fish Aggregating Devices, their deployment, design and set of rules for transhipment in port; - sets out measures designed to protect certain marine species present in the area covered by the IATTC Convention, such as oceanic white-tip, silky, and hammerhead sharks and mobulid rays. These measures include data provision and release duties, as well as measures related to the protection of sea turtles and seabirds; - contains provisions for the IATTC observer scheme; - sets vessel requirements, including those related to the IATTC Regional Vessel Register, to reporting duties and to the protocol for the sealing of wells; - contains information on the reporting duties related to the data statistical programme, and requirements for the bigeye tuna document programme; - provides for delegated powers granted to the Commission to cater for amendments to measures, which are expected to be frequent and to make sure that Union fishing vessels are put on equal footing with vessels of other Contracting Parties to the IATTC."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 8 July 2019, the Council adopted the mandate authorising the European Commission to open negotiations for the renewal of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania and the Protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Partnership Agreement, which expires on 15 November 2019. On 8 November 2019, the Protocol was extended for a period of one year by an Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters, until 15 November 2020 by means of Council Decision (EU) 2020/742. Due to the current health context (COVID -19 pandemic) the ongoing negotiations for the renewal of a Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and Protocol will not be concluded in time to avoid a disruption of fishing activities at the end of this extension. In this context, on 26 June 20203 the Council therefore authorised the Commission to negotiate a further extension to the Protocol for a maximum duration of one more year. CONTENT: in order to prevent an interruption of fishing activity for the European fleet operating in Mauritanian waters, the Council Decision endorsing this agreement in the form of an exchange of letters must be adopted in due time to allow for signature by both Parties before 15 November 2020, when the current Protocol expires. The aim of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters is to enable the European Union and Mauritania to continue working together to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and a sound exploitation of fishery resources in Mauritanian waters and to allow EU vessels to fish in those waters. Fishing opportunities The Protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - Vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 25 vessels; -Black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - Vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - Tuna seiners: 12 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 25 vessels; - Pole-and-line tuna vessels and longliners: 7 500 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - Pelagic freezer trawlers: 225 000 tonnes and 19 vessels; - Non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from volume under category 6 if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 61 625 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 57 500 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of Mauritania’s sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 4 125 000 per year for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of Mauritania’s national policy on the sustainable management of its continental and maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations is established during the annual budgetary procedure. The exchange of letters regarding the extension also sets out a pro rata reduction in case the negotiations for the renewal of the Partnership Agreement and its Protocol result in their signature, leading to their application, before the annual extension covered by the exchange of letters expires."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 7 July 2020, the Council adopted a mandate authorising the European Commission to open negotiations for a new protocol to the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands and for the possible prolongation of the current protocol to that Agreement, which will expire on 13 October 2020. In view of the complexity of the negotiations on a new Protocol to the Partnership Agreement on sustainable fisheries between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands, the two parties agreed on an extension of the current Protocol for a maximum period of one year, in accordance with the Council mandate. This extension was established by an Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters, initialled on 29 July 2020 in Brussels and Rarotonga (Cook Islands). The extension of the Protocol to the existing Agreement would make it possible to avoid interrupting the fishing activities of European vessels when the protocol expires on 13 October 2020, pending the finalisation of the negotiations on the renewal of the protocol. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands concerning the extension for one year of the framework established by the Protocol expiring on 13 October 2020. The aim of the Agreement is also to strengthen cooperation between the European Union and the Government of the Cook Islands, thereby creating a partnership framework within which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and sound exploitation of fishery resources in the fishing zone of the Cook Islands, in the interests of both parties. The current EU-Cook Islands protocol allows the EU fleet to fish in the Cook Islands waters for tuna species, for indicative annual fishing opportunities of 7 000 tonnes. The annual financial contribution from the European Union is EUR 700 000, based on: (a) an annual amount for access to fishery resources for the categories provided for in the Protocol, set at EUR 350 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol; (b) support for the development of the Cook Islands’ sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 350 000 for the duration of the extension to the Protocol. This support meets the objectives of the Cook Islands’ national policy on the sustainable management of their maritime fishery resources for the entire duration of the Protocol."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. At the end of the transition period, and in the absence of any special provision, all rights and obligations ensuing from Union law in respect of market access would be ended, insofar as the relationship between the United Kingdom and the Union and its Member States is concerned. In such a situation, the international transport of goods and passengers by road between the Union and the United Kingdom would be severely disrupted. PURPOSE: the present proposal thus has the objective to lay down temporary measures to govern the carriage of goods by road as well as the provision of regular and special regular passenger transport services between, on the one side, the Union and, on the other side, the United Kingdom following the end of the transition period referred to in the withdrawal agreement. These measures are intended to maintain basic connectivity for a strictly time-limited period of 6 months (until 30 June 2021) provided that the UK provides the same guarantees to EU carriers. The proposal provides for: - the unilateral granting of rights for bilateral carriage to road haulage operators established in United Kingdom so that they can continue to carry goods between their territory and the Union; - the unilateral granting of rights for the bilateral carriage of passengers by coach and bus as part of regular or special regular services to bus and coach operators established in the United Kingdom so that they can continue to carry passengers between their territory and the Union; - the unilateral granting of rights to pick up and set down passengers in the border region of Ireland in the course of international regular and special regular services between Ireland and the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland. In addition, the proposal: - makes rights granted to United Kingdom road operators subject to conformity with the relevant Union law applicable to road freight and road passenger transport operators and equivalent rights being granted by the United Kingdom to Union road operators; - lays down a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by EU road operators in the United Kingdom are equivalent to those granted to United Kingdom road operators under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of delegated acts; - lays down a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union road haulage operators and coach and bus service operators enjoy fair and equal opportunities to compete with United Kingdom road haulage operators and coach and bus service operators."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the Union and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In the absence of an agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom governing the matter, there would be no legal basis for the provision of air services between the United Kingdom and the Member States by the respective carriers after the end of the transition period under the withdrawal agreement. In a no-deal scenario, it is expected that the consequences for the respective economies would be severe. The disruption of air transport connectivity would represent the loss of a strategic asset for the EU and the Member States. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to ensure the provision of certain air services between the United Kingdom and the European Union for a limited period of 6 months (until 30 June 2021) if no agreement governing this area can be reached, provided that the United Kingdom does the same. The proposal provides for: - the unilateral grant of first, second, third and fourth freedom traffic rights to United Kingdom air carriers so that these can continue to overfly and make technical stops in Union's territory, as well as serve direct routes between the respective territories; - the possibility for UK carriers to provide those services by means of code-sharing or blocked-space arrangements, and to enter into leasing arrangements under strict conditions; - a mechanism to ensure that the rights enjoyed by Union carriers in the United Kingdom stay equivalent to those granted to UK carriers under the proposed Regulation. If that is not the case, the Commission is empowered to adopt the necessary measures to correct the situation by means of implementing acts; - the establishment of a flexible mechanism to ensure that Union air carriers enjoy fair and equal conditions of competition with United Kingdom carriers once the United Kingdom is no longer bound by Union law; - the establishment of procedures to enable Member States to verify that air carriers, aircraft and crews entering their territory under the Regulation are licensed or certified by the United Kingdom in accordance with internationally recognised safety standards."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. If no agreement on the future relationship that covers aviation safety is reached by the end of the transition period, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union will affect in particular the validity of certificates and licenses issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency on behalf of the United Kingdom, or by certain design organisations based in the United Kingdom. Regarding certain aeronautical products (‘type certificates’) and companies (‘organisation approvals’), the United Kingdom resumes, for its jurisdiction as of the end of the transition period, the role of ‘State of design’ under the Convention on International Civil Aviation. It is therefore necessary to develop a controlled transition mechanism, ensuring that the affected products or designs, which were certified by the Agency or a design organisation certified by the Agency before the end of the transition period, can continue to be used in Union aircraft without disruption. CONTENT: the proposal concerns aviation safety and complements Union Regulation (EC) 2018/1139 to deal specifically with the situation entailed by the end of transition period set in the withdrawal agreement in the absence of an agreement covering aviation safety matters applicable by that date. The proposal should allow EU manufacturers to continue production and operators to continue to operate these products in accordance with the applicable EU legal requirements. An interruption of these activities would cause serious economic and social difficulties. By ensuring compliance with EU law by the bodies concerned, the proposal should also ensure the protection of consumers and citizens. This Regulation should apply to the certificates listed in the Annex which are valid on the day preceding the date of application of this Regulation and which have been issued by the Agency to natural or legal persons having their principal place of business in the United Kingdom or by a design organisation having its principal place of business in the United Kingdom. It shall only apply in respect of aircraft registered in the Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of a package of targeted contingency measures to prepare for a possible scenario of no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom after the end of the transitional period. In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (the basic Regulation of the Common Fisheries Policy), Union fishing vessels enjoy equal access to EU waters and resources subject to the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. From the end of the transitional period, the Common Fisheries Policy would no longer apply to the United Kingdom. The UK waters (territorial sea and adjacent exclusive economic zone) will then no longer be part of EU waters. To ensure sustainable fisheries and given the importance of fishing for the economic livelihood of many communities, it is necessary to facilitate the authorisation procedures for fishing vessels. CONTENT: the proposal would amend EU Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 in order to create the appropriate legal framework valid until 31 December 2021, or until the date of conclusion of a fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom - whichever is earlier - on the continued reciprocal access of EU and UK vessels to each other's waters after 31 December 2020. The specific rules provided for in this proposal should apply from the day following the end of the transition period. The granting of authorisations is subject to the principle of ""reciprocity"", i.e. on condition that the United Kingdom extends access rights for EU vessels to conduct fishing activities in United Kingdom waters on a basis satisfactory to the Union. Consequently, authorisations would only be granted if and to the extent that the United Kingdom provides authorisations for Union vessels to make use of fishing opportunities allocated to them."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in its Communication of 11 December 2019, the Commission set out a European Green Deal for the European Union and its citizens. In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament welcomed this deal and called for the necessary transition to a climate-neutral society by 2050 at the latest. Transport accounts for a quarter of the Union’s greenhouse gas emissions, and still growing. To achieve climate neutrality, a 90% reduction in transport emissions is needed by 2050. The European Green Deal implies to accelerate the shift to sustainable and smart mobility to address these challenges. In particular, a substantial part of the 75% of inland freight carried today by road should shift onto rail and inland waterways. While the share of passenger rail in the Union land transport has only slightly increased since 2007, the share of freight has decreased. Rail has a significant role to play as a game changer to achieve the climate neutrality objective by 2050. It is one of the most environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transport modes. It is the only mode that has consistently reduced its greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 emissions since 1990 and increasingly uses renewable energy sources. 2021 shall be an important year for the Union rail policy: - it will be the first full year where the rules agreed under the Fourth Railway Package will be implemented throughout the Union, namely on the opening of the market of domestic passenger services and on reducing costs and administrative burden for railway undertakings operating across the Union; - there is a growing public interest in railways, including in night trains, in a number of Member States, as also illustrated by the popularity of #DiscoverEU; - the international arts festival ‘Europalia’ will dedicate its 2021 edition to the influence of railways on the arts and highlight the role of rail as a powerful promotor of social, economic and industrial change. CONTENT: the proposal aims to designate 2021 as the ‘European Year of Rail’ and responds to the objective of promoting rail transport in line with the objectives set out in the Commission's communication on the European Green Deal. Objectives The objective of the European Year shall be to encourage and support the efforts of the Union, the Member States, regional and local authorities, and other organisations to increase the share of passengers and freight moving by rail. In particular, the European Year shall: - promote rail as a sustainable, innovative and safe mode of transport, in particular by highlighting the role of rail as a game changer to help reaching the Union’s climate neutrality objective by 2050 and by reaching out to the wider public, especially youth; - highlight the European, cross-border dimension of rail, that brings citizens closer together, allows them to explore the Union in all its diversity, fosters cohesion and contributes to integrate the Union internal market; - enhance the contribution of rail to Union economy, industry and society, covering in particular aspects related to regional development, industrial competitiveness, sustainable tourism, innovation, employment, education, youth and culture, and improving accessibility for persons with disabilities; - contribute to promoting rail as an important element of the relations between the Union and neighbouring countries, in particular, in the Western Balkans. Content of the measures As with all European Years in the past, the main objective is to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities and highlight the role of the Union in promoting shared solutions. Measures shall include information and promotion campaigns, events, projects and initiatives at Union, national, regional and local levels. They shall serve to convey key messages and disseminate information about examples of good practice. The European Year shall be an opportunity to encourage Member States authorities and the sector to work together to promote rail transport. Every effort shall be made to ensure that the activities organised in the course of the European Year are tailored to meet the needs and circumstances of each Member State. Member States are therefore requested to appoint a national coordinator responsible for organising their participation in the European Year of Rail. A European steering group, including representatives of the national coordinators, shall be set up. The Commission shall convene meetings of the national coordinators in order to coordinate the running of the European Year and to exchange information regarding its implementation at national and EU level. Budgetary implications The necessary financial allocation for the implementation of this Decision for the period 2020-2021 is estimated to be EUR 8 million. Implementation of the European Year will involve appropriate funding to be determined in the context of the budgetary procedures for 2020, and 2021 in accordance with the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU, represented by the Commission, is a shareholder in the European Investment Fund (EIF) since the establishment of the EIF. It currently holds 29.7 % of the shares. The majority of the shares (58.9 %) are owned by the European Investment Bank. The rest (11.4 %) are owned by other financial institutions. According to Article 5(2) of the Statutes of the European Investment Fund the authorised capital of the Fund may be increased by decision of the General Meeting acting with a majority of 85 % of the votes cast. Considering the expected impact of the COVID-19 crisis and with a view to contributing to the Union and EIF response to the crisis through the implementation of the expected InvestEU Programme as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework for 2021-2027, the Board of Directors of the EIF decided to propose a capital increase to the General Meeting, where the Commission, representing the Union as a shareholder of the EIF, has to be in a position to vote on the increase. The EIF has calculated an immediate need for an increase in the authorised capital by EUR 2 870 000 000, which corresponds to a cash injection of EUR 1 250 000 000. To effectively respond to the COVID-19 crisis, the capital increase should be put in place as soon as possible. CONTENT: the proposal aims to enable the Commission, which represents the Union at the General Assembly, to vote in favour of the proposed increase in the EIF's capital of EUR 2 870 000 000. Additional capital would enable the EIF to play its role as a key partner in the implementation of the future InvestEU programme. It would therefore contribute to improving the Union's competitiveness, socio-economic convergence and cohesion, while supporting recovery from the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, in particular as regards support for innovative SMEs. In particular, the capital increase would: - contribute, in the areas of innovation and digitisation, to the efficient use of resources in line with the circular economy objectives, to the sustainability and inclusiveness of the Union's economic growth and to the resilience and integration of the Union capital markets; - further develop the EIF’s role in the management of national and regional programmes, thereby contributing to the EU's strategic objectives of improving access to finance for SMEs, encouraging regional development and supporting the objectives of the Capital Market Union. The proposal has no budgetary implications, as the vote at the General Meeting on the capital increase of the EIF does not oblige the Union to subscribe shares. Budgetary implications will only result from the InvestEU Regulation providing the legal basis for the participation of the EU in the capital increase."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in order to address the repercussions of the coronavirus crisis, the Commission has presented a number of proposals to ensure that all available financial means from the programmes for the period 2014-2020 financed by the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESI Funds) can be mobilised to provide immediate responses to the direct and indirect effects of the crisis. These proposals have made it possible to mobilise funds available to respond to the needs arising from increased pressure on health care systems and to help employers and workers to overcome this exceptional situation. This provided Member States and regions with immediate liquidity and flexibility to allocate funds where they were most needed. Nevertheless, the direct and indirect effects of the crisis have already taken their toll in many sectors. The economy is contracting and unemployment is rising. The uncertainty of the situation to follow may lead to slower recovery. In order to prevent the widening of disparities as well as to avoid an uneven recovery process, the Commission considers it necessary to provide additional support over the short and medium term to Member States and regions, in particular those whose economy has been hardest hit by the pandemic, to help their economies and societies weather the situation and to prepare the foundations of a swift recovery of their economies. These additional resources can only be deployed quickly in the real economy, if they are made available in the context of the still ongoing programmes of the 2014-2020 programming period. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 (the Common Provisions Regulation) to ensure that exceptional additional resources amounting to EUR 58 272 800 000 in current prices are made available to the Structural Funds under the ‘Investment for Growth and Employment’ objective for the period 2020-2022. The aim is to provide support to help repair the damage caused by the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in those geographical areas of Europe whose economy and employment have been hit the hardest. Additional resources The additional resources shall be available for budgetary commitments for the years 2020 to 2022, in addition to the global resources, as follows: - 2020: EUR 5 000 000 000 000; - 2021: EUR 42 434 400 000; - 2022: EUR 10 820 400 000. The additional resources for 2020 stem from an increase of global resources for economic, social and territorial cohesion in the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 and constitute additional global resources for the ERDF and ESF for the current period. The additional resources for 2021 and 2022 constitute external assigned revenue from the European Recovery Instrument. The Commission shall be empowered to set out in an implementing decision the breakdown of the totality of the additional resources for each Member State for the years 2020 and 2021 on the basis of the allocation criteria based on the latest available objective statistical data concerning Member States’ relative prosperity and the extent of the effect of the current crisis on their economies and societies. This implementing decision shall be revised in 2021. Application procedures The exceptional additional resources shall be made available for Member States from the Structural Funds to provide assistance for fostering crisis repair in the context of the COVID19 pandemic for the geographical areas of Europe whose economy and jobs have been harder hit and preparing a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy under a new cross-cutting thematic objective: - for the ERDF, the additional resources shall primarily be used to support investment in product and services for health services and to provide support in the form of working capital or investment support to SMEs including operational and personnel costs and health and safety measures; - for the ESF, the additional resources shall primarily be used to support job maintenance, including through short-time work schemes and support to self-employed, job creation, in particular for people in vulnerable situations, support to youth employment measures, skills development and to enhance access to social services of general interest, including for children; - Member States may also use some of these additional resources for the European Fund for the most deprived (FEAD). The proposal foresees that 50% of the additional resources for the year 2020 will be paid as initial pre-financing to the programmes concerned in order to allow the rapid implementation of the actions supported. In addition, the additional support may be fully financed from the EU budget without any national co-financing. Member States shall ensure that at least one evaluation is carried out before 31 December 2024 in order to assess the effects of the deployment of the additional resources. Budgetary implications The proposal shall lead to additional commitments in the year 2020, financed from an increase of the ceiling of the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework. It shall also lead to additional commitments for the years 2021 and 2022, financed from external assigned revenues and shall trigger additional payments in the years 2020 to 2025."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the attainment of the objectives of the European Capitals of Culture (ECOC) action provided for in Decision No 445/2014/EU is seriously jeopardised by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had serious implications on the delivery and preparation of current and upcoming ECOC. As a direct consequence of lock-down measures taken across Europe, cultural venues have been closed down and cultural events have been cancelled or postponed for an undetermined period of time. Both had to postpone or cancel all events since March 2020 without any clarity when the situation will come back to normality. In practice, they are prevented from implementing their ECOC year and capitalising on the huge investment made. In the three ECOC 2021, the pandemic results in a very high a level of uncertainty in nearly all areas associated with their preparation: insecure financing perspectives, unknown future safety regulations and travel restrictions, etc. In addition, there is a high level of uncertainty in the three European Capitals of Culture 2021. In order to remedy this exceptional situation, cities holding the title of European Capital of Culture that are most severely affected by the pandemic should be allowed to implement their programmes in a way that allows the delivery of the objectives of the action. CONTENT: The Commission proposes to amend Decision No 445/2014/EU to: - allow more than two Member States to be included, for the year 2023, in the calendar set out in the Annex to the Decision; - give Rijeka (Croatia) and Galway (Ireland) the possibility to extend their European Capital of Culture 2020 year until 30 April 2021, without changing the year of designation; - postpone from 2021 to 2023 the year in which Timisoara (Romania) and Elefsina (Greece) shall be entitled to host the European Capital of Culture event; - postpone from 2021 to 2022 the year in which a candidate or potential candidate country may apply to host the European Capital of Culture event. Following the UK’s withdrawal from the Union, only one city is scheduled to hold the ECOC title in 2023. Postponing two of the three ECOC 2021 to 2023 would be more balanced: there would be three ECOC in 2022 and three ECOC in 2023. The proposal has no direct budgetary implication.

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Bonn Agreement aims to combat pollution in the North Sea Area and safeguard coastal areas from maritime disasters and chronic pollution from ships and offshore installations. The European Union is a Contracting Party to the Agreement. Amendments were made to the agreement in 1989. These amendments entered into force on 1 April 1994. On 7 October 2019, the Council authorised the Commission to negotiate, on behalf of the Union, an amendment to extend the scope of the Bonn Agreement with a view to improving cooperation on surveillance with regard to the requirements of Annex VI to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (the ""MARPOL Convention"") and the extension to the Kingdom of Spain under Article 20 of the Agreement. The amendments are now submitted for conclusion by the Union. CONTENT: the proposed Decision provides that the Council authorises the Commission to conclude, on behalf of the Union, the envisaged amendments to the Bonn Agreement relating to the extension of the material scope of the Agreement as regards Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention and the accession of the Kingdom of Spain to the Agreement. The amendments envisaged are the following: The ‘MARPOL amendment’ – amending the substantive scope of the Agreement This amendment seeks to improve cooperation and coordination between the Contracting Parties in combating unlawful air emissions caused by shipping in order to limit the negative consequences of the combustion of marine fuels with high sulphur or nitrogen content for human health, biodiversity and the entire marine environment. The adoption of the decision to conclude the amendment on the extension of the mandate of the Bonn Agreement in relation to Annex VI to the MARPOL Convention would improve joint surveillance, monitoring and reporting of ship emissions in the North Sea area. The ‘Spain amendment’ – amending the geographical scope of the Agreement This amendment extends the geographical scope of the Agreement to cover the area between the zone of joint responsibility of France and the United Kingdom and the new zone of responsibility of Spain in order to close any gaps between the old boundary of the Bonn Agreement and the new zone of responsibility of Spain. France has accepted the introduction of a new zone of responsibility of France."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal to amend Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 on EU Financial Benchmarks is based on the fact that one of the most important indices for the financial world, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), is to be phased out by the end of 2021. Financial benchmarks are indices by reference to which the amount payable under a financial instrument or a financial contract or the value of a financial instrument is determined. By setting out governance and data quality standards for benchmarks that are referenced in financial contracts, the Benchmark Regulation aims to strengthen the trust of capital market participants in indices used as benchmarks in the Union. In light of the anticipated cessation of LIBOR after the end of 2021, supervised entities (such as banks, investment firms or asset managers) in the European Union shall be faced with legal uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of financial contracts. In order to avoid adverse consequences for the lending capacity of the European banking sector, early clarification as to the availability of a statutory replacement rate for use by supervised entities in all LIBOR referencing contracts that mature beyond the end of 2021 is necessary. The fact that the Benchmarks Regulation does not provide for mechanisms to organise the orderly discontinuation of a systemically important benchmark in the Union could lead to heterogeneity in the solutions adopted by different Member States, which would lead to disruptions in the internal market. CONTENT: this proposal amending the Financial Benchmarks Regulation introduces various tools to ensure that the phasing out of a widely used interbank rate does not unduly affect the ability of the banking sector to provide funding to EU companies and therefore jeopardise a key objective of the Capital Markets Union. By providing the necessary tools for a legally sound transition away from IBOR rates, this initiative would benefit retail customers who have taken out loans with IBOR rates as a benchmark. Orderly termination of a financial benchmark The proposed amendments to the provisions of the Benchmarks Regulation governing the winding down of a benchmark with systemic relevance in the Union are based on three main pillars: 1. The European Commission may designate a replacement rate if and when a benchmark whose cessation would result in significant disruption in the functioning of financial markets in the Union ceases to be published. In designating the statutory replacement rate, the European Commission shall take into account the recommendations of the risk free rate working groups operating under the auspices of the central banks responsible for the currency in which the rates of the benchmark in cessation are denominated. 2. The statutory replacement rate shall replace, by law, all references to the 'discontinuing benchmark' in all contracts concluded by an EU supervised entity. In order to benefit from the statutory replacement rate, contracts using the Cessation Benchmark should be ongoing at the time the designation enters into force; no contract concluded after the entry into force of the implementing act designating the statutory replacement rate would be allowed to use the statutory replacement rate as a reference. 3. For contracts not involving an EU supervised entity, Member State are encouraged to adopt national statutory replacement rates. At the appropriate time, the European Commission may issue a recommendation that the national statutory replacement rates will be identical to the statutory replacement rate that is designated for contracts involving EU supervised entities. Exemption of specific foreign exchange benchmarks The proposed amendments aim at exempting specified third country spot foreign exchange benchmarks from the scope of the Regulation where they fulfil certain criteria. In order for the spot foreign exchange benchmark to qualify for exemption, it has to: (1) measure the spot exchange rate of a third-country currency that is not freely convertible and (2) be used by EU supervised entities, on a frequent, systematic and regular basis as settlement rate to calculate the pay-out under a currency forward or swap contract. Furthermore, to enable the Commission to have all the necessary elements to designate exempted benchmarks, ESMA and the ECB are required to provide it with relevant information and views on specific exemption criteria."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 outbreak has changed the economic outlook for the coming years in the Union and the world. As lockdown measures are gradually being lifted, a strategic plan is needed for recovery, economic revitalisation and a return to sustainable growth. In this respect, it is essential to set up a stand-alone instrument to accompany Member States in their reform efforts by providing substantial technical support to strengthen their administrative capacity to design and implement reforms that shall foster resilience and support recovery. The Technical Support Instrument builds on the success of the Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP), which has constantly experienced positive feedback from beneficiary Member States and excess demand in respect of the budgets available in the past selection rounds (e.g. for the 2020 round, of the 609 requests submitted, equating to a value of EUR 250 million, 228 amounting to EUR 84.7 million could be selected). The Instrument is also part of the Commission's initiatives in response to the COVID-19 outbreak to help Member States mitigate the massive economic and social consequences. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to establish a stand-alone Technical Support Instrument available to all Member States, as a successor to the Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP) 2017-2020. Objectives The technical support instrument shall encourage Member States, together with technical measures, to carry out institutional, administrative and growth sustaining and resilience-enhancing structural reforms. Its specific objectives shall be to assist national authorities in improving their capacity to design, develop and implement reforms, including through the exchange of good practices, appropriate processes and methods and more effective and efficient human resource management. These objectives shall be pursued in close cooperation with the Member States concerned. The instrument shall complement and add value to existing assistance provided by the different EU sectoral programmes and actions under EU funds. It should also provide technical support for the design and implementation of reforms to be carried out under the new Recovery and Resilience Facility. Scope of application This shall cover a broad range of policy domains that include areas related to public financial and asset management, institutional and administrative reform, business environment, product, service and labour markets, education and training, sustainable development, public health, education and the financial sector. Specific emphasis is given to actions that foster the green and digital transitions. Implementation The Commission shall analyse the requests for support on the basis of urgency, breadth and depth of the problems identified, support needs in respect of the policy area concerned, analysis of socioeconomic indicators and general administrative capacity of the Member State. Based on that analysis and taking into account the existing measures and actions financed by other Union funds or Union programmes, the Commission shall come to an agreement with the Member State on the priority areas for support, the objectives, an indicative timeline, the scope of the support measures to be provided and the estimated global financial contribution, to be set out in a cooperation and support plan. Provisions are made on communication activities vis-à-vis the European Parliament and the Council and vis-à-vis the general public, as well as provisions on complementarity, monitoring, annual reports and evaluation. Budgetary implications The financial envelope for the implementation of the Technical Support Instrument for the period 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2027 shall be EUR 864 406 000 (in current prices). In addition to that financial envelope, Member States may transfer on voluntary basis, technical assistance resources under shared management programmes to the Technical Support Instrument."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the current situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and requires exceptional measures to be taken with regard to aid provided to the most deprived under the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD). The first “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative” (CRII), a package of measures which entered into force on 1 April 2020, introduced a number of important changes to the legislative framework applicable to the European Structural and Investment Funds that allow for a more effective response in the current situation. Complementary measures were adopted under the “Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus” (CRII Plus). This package also included amendments to Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 (FEAD Regulation), through Regulation (EU) 2020/559 of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing specific measures of additional flexibility and liquidity for Member States to address the COVID-19 pandemic under the FEAD. The direct and indirect effects of the crisis have already taken their toll in many sectors. The process of recovery shall take time and the need for further lockdown measures cannot be excluded. In this context, there is a serious risk that the number of people suffering from food and material deprivation shall increase and therefore further action is required in order to respond to the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure a socially fair recovery in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Commission therefore proposes a further amendment to the Regulation laying down common provisions for the European Structural and Investment Funds (REACT-EU) and the FEAD Regulation in order to provide additional resources to these Funds until 2022. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 so that Member States can provide additional resources to the FEAD until 2022. This shall make additional resources available for basic food and material and accompanying measures, as well as for specific social inclusion measures. The financing of the main post-crisis recovery measures and support for the most deprived may therefore continue uninterrupted. Voluntary increase of resources in response to the COVID-19 outbreak It is proposed that Member States may voluntarily increase the overall resources provided for in the FEAD Regulation to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States should consider this possibility taking into account the increase in the number of the most deprived since the emergence of the pandemic. The increase in resources may have an impact on the budgetary commitments for 2020, 2021 and 2022. In order to ensure that Member States have sufficient financial means to prepare for the economic recovery, the proposal provides for a higher level of pre-financing for the rapid implementation of the actions supported by the additional resources. In addition to the pre-financing provided for in the Regulation, the Commission shall pay a pre-financing amount of 50% of the additional resources allocated for the year 2020 following the Commission decision approving the amendment to a programme for the allocation of the additional resources. In order to alleviate the burden on public budgets to repair the damage caused by the crisis, it is foreseen that the additional resources shall not be co-financed. Scope of technical assistance The proposal specifies that at the initiative of the Member States, and subject to a ceiling of 5% of the Fund's allocation at the time of adoption of the operational programme and 5% of the additional resources, the operational programme may finance: - preparatory, management, monitoring, administrative and technical assistance, audit, information, control and evaluation measures necessary for the implementation of the Fund, including the preparation and operating costs of voucher systems if these costs are borne by the managing authority or another public body which is not a partner organisation; - technical assistance measures to partner organisations and any other actor associated with the implementation of the Fund, as well as capacity building measures for partner organisations and any other actor associated with the implementation of the Fund, including measures to stimulate crisis response capacities in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions may concern the subsequent programming period, including to ensure the continuation of the support by this Fund through other Funds. Budgetary implications The proposal will lead to: - additional commitments in the year 2020, financed from an increase of the ceiling of the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework; - additional commitments for the years 2021 and 2022, financed from external assigned revenues. The proposal shall trigger additional payments in the years 2020 to 2025."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Directive 91/477/EEC on control of the acquisition and possession of weapons has been substantially amended several times. In the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 91/477/EEC. The proposed new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive lays down minimum provisions on the movement of firearms in the EU as defined in Annex I (Category A - Prohibited firearms; Category B - Firearms subject to authorisation and Category C - Firearms and other weapons subject to declaration). The Directive shall be without prejudice to the application of national provisions concerning the carrying of weapons, hunting or sporting shooting, where the weapons are legally acquired and held in accordance with the Directive. It shall not apply to the acquisition or possession, in accordance with national law, of arms and ammunition by armed forces, police or public authorities. The Directive shall not affect the power of Member States to take measures to prevent illegal arms trafficking. Member States could adopt stricter provisions in their legislation than those provided for in the Directive. Marking and registration All firearms manufactured in or imported into the Union on or after 14 September 2018 should be clearly, permanently marked and registered without delay after manufacture and, at the latest, before being placed on the market, or without delay after import into the Union. Member States shall: - establish a system including at least: (a) the registration of dealers and brokers operating in the territory of that Member State; (b) the requirement for dealers and brokers to be licensed or authorised in the territory of that Member State; and (c) a check on the professional and private good repute and relevant competence of the dealer or broker concerned; - establish a computerised data file, whether centralised or decentralised, guaranteeing access by the authorised authorities to the data-filing systems in which each firearm covered by the Directive is registered; - ensure that data relating to firearms, including the relevant personal data, are kept by the competent authorities in the data files for a period of 30 years after the destruction of the firearms or essential components in question. Traceability The Directive requires dealers and brokers to keep a record of all entries and exits they make with respect to each firearm, as well as data to enable the identification and tracing of the firearm. Gunsmiths and brokers established on their territory should report firearms transactions to the competent national authorities without undue delay. Acquisition and possession Member States shall permit the acquisition and possession of firearms only by persons who have good cause and who: - are at least 18 years of age, except in relation to the acquisition, other than through purchase, and possession of firearms for hunting and target shooting, provided that in that case persons of less than 18 years of age have parental permission, or are under parental guidance or the guidance of an adult with a valid firearms or hunting licence, or are within a licensed or otherwise approved training centre; - are not likely to be a danger to themselves or others, to public order or to public safety; the fact of having been convicted of a violent intentional crime shall be considered as indicative of such danger. Member States shall: - have in place a monitoring system, which operates continuously or periodically, to ensure that the conditions for the granting of an authorisation laid down by national law are fulfilled for the entire duration of the authorisation ; - lay down rules on the proper monitoring of firearms and ammunition and rules on their proper storage under safe conditions. Member States may take all appropriate measures to prohibit the acquisition and possession of category A firearms, essential components and ammunition. They may grant category A authorisations to marksmen and sportsmen, as well as to recognised museums and, in exceptional and duly substantiated cases, to collectors, subject to strict security measures. Authorisations to possess firearms shall be subject to periodic review at intervals of not more than five years. Deactivation of firearms The risk of acoustic weapons and other types of blank-firing weapons being converted into real firearms is high. Therefore, they shall be included within the scope of Directive. Taking into consideration the high risk of reactivating improperly deactivated firearms, the Directive requires the classification of deactivated firearms under category C (firearms subject to declaration). The deactivation of firearms shall be verified by a competent authority to ensure that modifications made to a firearm render all its essential components permanently inoperable and incapable of being reactived. The Commission shall establish standards and techniques to ensure that all essential components of a firearm are rendered permanently inoperable. Semi-automatic firearms Some dangerous semi-automatic firearms have now been added to category A and are therefore prohibited for civilian use. This is the case for: - short semi-automatic firearms with loading devices over 20 rounds; - long semi-automatic firearms with loading devices over 10 rounds; - semi-automatic long firearms that can be reduced to a length of less than 60 cm without losing functionality by means of a folding or telescoping stock or by a stock that can be removed without using tools. European firearms pass The European firearms pass is a document issued by the competent authorities of a Member State, upon request, to a person who becomes lawfully the holder and user of a firearm. Its maximum period of validity is five years, with the possibility of extension. The European firearms pass would be regarded as the main document required of target shooters and other persons authorised in accordance with this Directive to possess a firearm during a journey to another Member State."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the decline in passenger demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, air carriers have made major changes to their schedules since 1 March 2020, which have resulted in a slot utilisation rate at coordinated airports falling far below the 80% threshold imposed by the Slot Regulation. This situation is likely to continue to negatively impact air carriers up to and including winter 2024/2025. For the period starting after more than a year of waiving the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule (from 1 February 2020 to 27 March 2021), which preserves air carriers’ 2019 grandfathered slots until the end of the winter 2021/2022 scheduling season, the Commission proposes to establish a pathway to return to a normal application of the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ rule. The return to normal should not be sudden to avoid destabilising the aviation market to the detriment of air carriers, connectivity, EU consumers, and the environment. It should take place in line with future increases in traffic levels toward 2019 levels or by a stabilisation of air traffic to a new market situation. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that from the start of the summer 2021 scheduling period, the normal application of the slot utilisation requirements of the Slot Regulation should reapply, but that the rate should be set at 40/60 % instead of 80/20 %. Relief should be targeted at air carriers whose intention is to operate their grandfathered slots as soon as demand sufficiently recovers and flights are once again economically viable. Consequently, slot series newly allocated to an air carrier for the first time would not be covered by the planned relief. The proposal foresees a deadline for air carriers to return unwanted slots to the coordinator if they want to benefit from the relief. A deadline of three weeks before the planned operational date for that slot would give airports and other airport service providers visibility on the required capacity and the volume of operations that they are expected to make available adequate infrastructure, facilities and staff. The proposal also clarifies under what circumstances coordinators could withdraw slots from air carriers. The Commission could adopt delegated acts to further extend the period during which the relief applies if the COVID-19 pandemic is not resolved and continues to have a negative impact on the air transport sector, including on historical grandfather rights."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the COVID-19 crisis, Regulation (EU) 2020/698 extended for a period of 6 months (or 7 months in some cases) the period of validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and postponed the completion of certain periodic checks and continuing training which, under the relevant EU legislation, should have taken place during the period between 1 March 2020 (or 1 February 2020 in some cases) and 31 August 2020. Some Member States have submitted reasoned requests to the Commission for authorisation to extend certain periods again. The Commission has adopted six decisions authorising such extensions. Despite some improvements in the situation during the summer of 2020, the persistence of the pandemic in the third quarter of 2020 forced Member States to maintain or even reinforce the measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease. As a consequence, transport operators may not be able to complete the formalities or procedures necessary to comply with certain provisions of EU law on the renewal or extension of certificates, licences or approvals, or on the completion of periodic checks and continuous training, or to take other necessary steps to maintain their validity, as was the case in spring 2020. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to adopt measures to remedy these problems and to ensure both legal certainty and the proper functioning of the legal acts concerned. CONTENT: the proposal aims to establish temporary measures applicable to the renewal and extension of the validity of certain certificates, licences and authorisations and to the postponement of certain periodic checks and periodic training in response to the exceptional situation arising from the spread of COVID-19 in the fields of road, rail and inland waterway transport and maritime security during reference periods subsequent to those referred to in Regulation (EU) 2020/698. The proposal provides for adaptations, in particular for certain time limits, as well as the possibility for the Commission to authorise extensions on the basis of a request submitted by any Member State by 1 April 2021 at the latest. Such extensions should be limited to what is necessary in view of the period during which the completion of formalities, procedures, checks and training are likely to remain impracticable and, in any event, should not exceed six months. The proposal concerns specific provisions which affect the application of several directives and regulations concerning in particular: - the initial qualification and periodic training of drivers of certain road vehicles for the carriage of goods or passengers for driving licences; - tachographs in road transport; - the periodic technical inspection of motor vehicles and their trailers; - the conditions to be complied with to pursue the occupation of road transport operator; - access to the international road haulage market and access to the international market for coach and bus services; - railway safety, the certification of train drivers operating locomotives and trains on the railway system in the Union and the rules establishing a single European railway area; - the conditions for obtaining boatmasters' certificates for the carriage of goods and passengers by inland waterway in the Union, technical requirements for inland waterway vessels and the improvement of ship and port facility security. The Regulation should enter into force as a matter of urgency so that the situations of legal uncertainty affecting many authorities and operators in different sectors are minimised."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II) lays down rules for investment firms operating in EU financial markets. These rules determine how investment firms should interact with investors and how they should organise the trading venues. The rules on investment services have an important role to play in promoting the recapitalisation of European firms in the aftermath of the crisis. In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, formal burdens that are not strictly necessary should be removed. The Commission therefore strives to recalibrate investor protection requirements to strike the right balance between a sufficient level of transparency for the client, the highest standards of protection and acceptable compliance costs for firms. This legislative proposal amending MiFID II is part of a set of measures to facilitate the economic recovery post-COVID-19 pandemic, which includes also legislative proposals amending the Prospectus Regulation the Securitisation Regulation and the Capital Requirements Regulation. CONTENT: the proposal primarily aims at providing, for exceptional reasons in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, for a streamlined application of the regulatory requirements, keeping high safeguards for retail clients while allowing for more flexibility for wholesale clients and ensures that fully functioning commodity markets can play their important role in the recovery of EU economies. This legislative proposal also aims to complement the objectives of the Capital Markets Union to diversify market-based sources of financing for European companies and facilitate cross-border investments. Amendments to information requirements The changes to the current regime provide a precise calibration of the rules applicable to retail clients, professional customers and eligible counterparties. The majority of the proposed changes shall consist of relief for professional clients and eligible counterparties, namely: - the phasing out of paper-based default method: documents shall be provided in electronic format. However, retail clients may opt-in to paper based information; - as regards the indication of costs and charges, the introduction of an exemption for eligible counterparties and professional clients for services other than investment advice and portfolio management. In addition, in case of distance communication all clients using all services shall be able, under certain conditions, to receive costs and charges information just after the transaction; - lighter ex-post reporting obligations: these reports shall no longer apply in respect of eligible counterparties; professional clients shall be able to choose whether or not to receive them; - the temporary suspension of best execution reporting; - the waiver by professional investors of cost-benefit analysis in the event of a change of product during the course of the relationship; - the lifting of the product governance requirements for simple corporate bonds with make-whole clauses (which are investor-protective features). The aim of this exemption is to make more plain vanilla corporate bonds available to retail investors. Measures affecting energy derivatives markets The proposal introduces changes to the regime applicable to commodities with a view to enabling businesses in the real economy to cope with market volatility, while at the same time allowing the emergence of new commodity contracts, which is also important for promoting the international role of the euro. The proposed amendments recalibrate precisely the position limit regime and the scope of the hedging exemption. They shall not concern agricultural commodities, in particular products for human consumption."

BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has applied to the Commission for recognition of the equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of forest reproductive material produced in that country with that produced in the EU in accordance with the respective Union law. The Commission has examined the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom. It has concluded that forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, produced in the United Kingdom is equivalent to forest reproductive material produced in the EU, since the former affords the same assurances as regards the approval of its basic material and the measures taken for its production with a view to marketing as the latter. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the Union recognises the equivalence of forest reproductive material, and in particular the categories ‘source-identified’, ‘selected’ and ‘qualified’ material, with the respective material produced within the Union. This recognition is based on an examination of the legislation applicable in the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and systems in place are equivalent to those of the Union.

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in view of the end of the transitional period provided for in the withdrawal agreement, the United Kingdom has submitted to the Commission a request for recognition of equivalence, from 1 January 2021, of fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of fibre and oil plants produced in the United Kingdom with fodder plant seed, cereal seed, beet seed and seed of oil plants produced in the Union. The United Kingdom has also requested the recognition of the equivalence as regards the checks on practices for the maintenance of varieties carried out in the United Kingdom pursuant to those Directives. The Commission has carried out a review of the relevant legislation in the United Kingdom. It has concluded (i) that the requirements and the system in force are equivalent to those of the Union and offer the same guarantees as the Union system; (ii) that the checks on practices for the maintenance of such varieties carried out in the United Kingdom afford the same assurances as those carried out by the Member States. CONTENT: the proposal adds the United Kingdom to the list of countries for which the equivalence of field inspections, and of checks on practices for the maintenance of seed-producing crops of cereal species and the equivalence of the seed produced have been recognised. This recognition is based on an examination of the relevant legislation of the United Kingdom and the conclusion that its requirements and system in place offer the same guarantees as the Union's system. Following the addition of the United Kingdom on that list, the imports of seeds from the United Kingdom into the Union, as well as the maintenance of the respective varities in that country, should be allowed."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: an effective control system is essential to ensure that EU fisheries are managed in a sustainable manner, which in turn ensures the long-term viability of the EU fisheries sector and protects the livelihoods of EU fishermen. The measures establishing a Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) for ensuring compliance with rules of the CFP are provided for in four different legal acts: 1) the Fisheries Control Regulation; 2) the Regulation establishing a European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA); 3) the Regulation establishing a system to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU Regulation); and 4) the Regulation on the sustainable management of the external fishing fleets (SMEF). With the exception of the SMEF regulation, which was recently revised, the current Union Fisheries Control System (FCS) was designed prior to the reformed Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and as such it is not fully coherent with it. In addition, the system reflects control strategies, methodologies and challenges of more than 10 years ago, and it is not equipped to effectively address current and future needs in terms of fisheries data and fleet control, to match the constant evolution of fishing practices and techniques and to take advantage of modern and more cost-effective control technologies and data exchange systems. The current system also does not reflect new and modern Union policies recently adopted, such as the plastic strategy, the digital single market strategy, and the international ocean governance. Several discussions and exchanges of view have taken place in the Council, in the Parliament, in the Administrative Board of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) with Member States and with stakeholders since the publication of all these documents. Those discussions confirmed that there is unanimous agreement among the European Institutions and among direct stakeholders that the Fisheries Control System is not effective and efficient and that, as such, it is not entirely fit for purpose to sustain the achievements of the CFP objectives. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the option selected is targeted changes to the fisheries control system (in particular regulations on fisheries control, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the European Fisheries Control Agency). Positive environmental impacts of the preferred option would encompass: reduction of overfishing, elimination of discards at sea, healthier fish stocks and proper control of marine protected areas. Main socio-economic benefits include: increased wages and competitiveness of fishing industry, especially for the small fleet; promotion of job creation (especially in ICT); improved compliance with the CFP and equal treatment of fishers. CONTENT: the specific objectives of the proposed revision of the fisheries control regime are to: bridge the gaps with the CFP and with other EU policies; simplify the legislative framework and reduce unnecessary administrative burden; improve availability, reliability and completeness of fisheries data and information, in particular of catch data, and allow exchange and sharing of information; remove obstacles that hinder the development of a culture of compliance and the equitable treatment of operators within and across Member States. The proposal contains, inter alia, the following measures: clarification of the inspection process , inspectors' duties, and masters' and operators' duties during inspections. Digitisation of inspection reports through the mandatory use of an Electronic Inspection Report System which will allow a better use and exchange of data between relevant authorities and Member States; a new list of infringements of the CFP rules, which should be qualified as serious by nature, new detailed and exhaustive list of criteria to qualify as serious certain other infringements of the CFP rules; a more reliable and complete fisheries data system providing for the full digitisation of transhipment and landing declarations, applicable to all EU fishing vessels (including those less than 12 metres in length), an electronic traceability system for all vessels, new weighing procedures for fishery products and strengthened rules for recording recreational catches; better traceability of EU and imported fishery and aquaculture products : traceability information is clarified so that it allows linking a specific lot of fishery products to a particular landing by an EU fishing vessel. Information is recorded electronically so that controls in the supply chain within the internal market are more effective and efficient; the use of remote electronic monitoring tools , in particular CCTVs, for the control of the landing obligation. Certain vessels with active fishing gears shall be fitted with a device that monitors and records engine power; improving the reporting of lost fishing gear through the use of (electronic) logbooks for all categories of vessels, the deletion of the current derogation for vessels under 12 metres to take on board the equipment necessary to recover lost gear and laying down conditions to establish EU provisions for the marking and control of fishing gear for recreational fisheries; the revision of the mandate of the European Fisheries Control Agency (EFCA) to fully align its objectives with the Common Fisheries Policy and extend its inspection powers."

Parliament gave its consent to the draft Council regulation. The Regulation laying down implementing measures for the system of own resources (IMSOR) is part of the legislative package presented by the Commission in May 2018. The IMSOR as submitted in 2018 included provisions of a general and technical nature that are applicable to all categories of own resources and that would benefit from a better involvement of the European Parliament in the legislative procedure. The Council made substantial changes on the Commission proposal. The provisions to be taken up in the IMSOR are listed in Article 10 of the Own Resources Decision as adopted by the Council December 2020. In particular, Article 10 no longer includes any provisions pertaining to new own resources based on the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) because these categories of own resources were not taken up in the Council Decision of December 2020. Moreover, the Council did not retain in the IMSOR any provisions related to the determination of the ‘applicable call rates’. These are now to be determined entirely in the own resources decision itself. The draft Council Regulation as referred to the European Parliament contains provisions on the definition and calculation of the annual balance (usually a surplus) as well as control, supervision and reporting requirements for national authorities."

The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the 143 EU agricultural, fish and industrial WTO tariff-rate quotas. The aim is to maintain the full existing volume of each tariff quota in the future, but to divide it between two separate customs territories: the EU-27 and the UK. The principle behind the applied methodology is based on trade flows to the EU-27 and the UK during a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. The negotiations with Norway resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 7-8 July 2020."

The committee responsible recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. The EU published its Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan in 2003. The plan aims to combat illegal logging around the world. By entering Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with timber producing third countries, the EU opens for imports of legally sourced timber and timber products to enter the Single Market. These agreements are binding trade agreements. They also contribute to better regulation and governance of the forest sector in the exporting country. Honduras was the first Latin American country to initiate and successfully conclude negotiations for a VPA with the EU. These negotiations started in 2013 and were completed in 2018. Honduras is also the first VPA partner that has included indigenous peoples as a separate interest group at the negotiating table. For the EU, this agreement is in line with its objectives under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement, the Aichi Targets of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030. Within these frameworks, it is committed to, inter alia, encouraging sustainable forest management, combating deforestation and forest degradation and promoting sustainable development. The Voluntary Partnership Agreement between the EU and Honduras: - establishes the framework, institutions and systems for the timber legality assurance system for the FLEGT licensing scheme; - sets out the framework for monitoring compliance and for independent evaluation of the system; - includes a clear commitment by Honduras to develop legislation to ensure that timber imported in Honduras has been legally harvested in compliance with the applicable legislation in the country of harvest; - establishes a mechanism for dialogue and cooperation between the EU and Honduras on the FLEGT licensing scheme, via a Joint Implementation Committee; - establishes principles of stakeholder participation, social safeguards, accountability and transparency, and mechanisms for complaints on, monitoring of and reporting on implementation of the Agreement. The Agreement makes provision for import controls at the EU’s borders, as provided for in Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 on the FLEGT licensing scheme and Regulation (EC) No 1024/2008 laying down detailed measures for implementing it."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Institute of Innovation and Technology was established in 2008 by Regulation (EC) No 294/2008, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2013, and has its headquarters in Budapest. Its overall mission is to stimulate sustainable European economic growth and competitiveness by strengthening the innovative capacity of Member States and the Union. The functioning of the EIT is based on its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). These are large-scale European partnerships bringing together educational institutions, research institutes and professional organisations to address specific societal challenges. The EIT is an integral part of the Commission's proposal to establish Horizon Europe, the EU's next research and innovation programme (2021-2027). It is one of the three components of its ""Innovative Europe"" pillar. The Horizon Europe proposal sets out the budget for the EIT for the next MFF as well as its rationale, added value, areas of intervention and broad lines of activity. However, the Horizon Europe proposal itself does not provide the legal basis for continuing the EIT operations as from 2021. The legal base of the EIT remains the EIT Regulation which defines its mission, its main tasks and the framework for its operation. As a number of provisions of the EIT Regulation refer directly to the current Horizon 2020 programme for the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to amend these provisions in order to make them compatible with the next Union framework programmes supporting research and innovation. The proposal builds on the external evaluation of the EIT carried out in 2017 which confirmed that the rationale behind the establishment of the EIT is valid. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the preferred option is based on the baseline scenario (continuation of the EIT's activities in their current form, with the necessary adjustments to bring the EIT into line with the Horizon Europe proposal). In addition, it provides for the adoption of a number of technical measures to improve the functioning of the EIT and proposes a new action to encourage entrepreneurial education across Europe. CONTENT: the proposal for a revised EIT Regulation aims to ensure greater legal clarity and alignment with the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. The Commission proposes to make the new EIT Regulation time neutral so that amendments to it at the end of each MFF would in principle not be necessary or only minimal. The EIT's Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) would define the priority areas and long-term strategy for EIT action for a period of seven years. It should ensure that it is in line with the objectives of the relevant EU framework programme for support for research and innovation and with the requirements of that programme for multi-annual strategic planning, monitoring and other activities, and promote synergies with other relevant programmes under each new MFF. In concrete terms, the recast proposal: - clarifies the missions of the EIT and assigns it a new mission to design and coordinate support actions undertaken by the KICs for the development of entrepreneurial and innovation capacity of Higher Education Institutions and their integration in innovation ecosystems; - updates the reference to the Union framework programme supporting research and innovation as regards the indicators for the continuous monitoring and periodic external evaluations of the KICs; - reinforces the comprehensive mid-term review of each KIC before the expiry of the initial framework partnership agreement and introduces the notion of a memorandum of cooperation, as a facultative means to ensure EIT-KICs relation following the end date of the framework partnership agreement. - provides the EIT with a light and simplified funding model, designed to more effectively encourage additional private and public investment: the EIT's contribution to the KICs could only cover up to 100 % of the total eligible costs of KIC added-value activities only in the initial stages of the KIC life. Such contribution shall gradually decrease over time in compliance with the co-funding rates defined in the SIA. It also emphasises the importance of financial sustainability of KICs within the EIT’s competitive allocation mechanism; - strengthens the governance structure of the EIT: the amendments aim to clarify the roles of the EIT Governing Board, Executive Committee and Director, strengthen the Governing Board’s role in the monitoring, supervision and steering of KICs and clarify the Commission’s role vis-à-vis the EIT to reflect its obligations in terms of monitoring and sound financial management."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Institute of Innovation and Technology was established in 2008 by Regulation (EC) No 294/2008, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2013. Its overall mission is to stimulate sustainable European economic growth and competitiveness by strengthening the innovative capacity of Member States and the Union. The EIT achieves these objectives mainly through its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together more than 1 200 partners from business, research and education. The EIT is an integral part of the Commission's proposal for the Horizon Europe Programme (2021-2027), and more particularly the Open Innovation pillar of this programme, but it has a separate legal basis (the EIT Regulation). This initiative aims to make the EIT Regulation compatible with Horizon Europe and to improve the functioning of the EIT, taking into account the lessons learned in recent years. It also aims to propose a new Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIP) setting out the EIT's strategy and priorities for the period 2021-2027, as well as its objectives, key actions, expected results and resource requirements. For the period 2021-2027, the SIA should ensure consistency with Horizon Europe's objectives and the programme's requirements for multiannual strategic planning, monitoring and other activities, and promote synergies with other relevant programmes. This proposal for a new EIT SIA for the period 2021-2027 is therefore presented in parallel to the proposal to recast the EIT Regulation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the chosen option is based on the baseline scenario (continuation of the EIT's activities in their current form, with the necessary adjustments to bring the EIT into line with the Horizon Europe proposal). In addition, it adopts a number of technical measures to enhance the functioning of the EIT and proposes a new action to foster entrepreneurial education across Europe. CONTENT: the proposed EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) for the period 2021-2027 defines the EIT's priority areas, strategy and financial needs for this period and sets out how the EIT will contribute to the achievement of Horizon Europe's objectives. Main improvements The SIA clarifies the role of the EIT in the Horizon Europe programme and sets out its complementarity to the various parts of Horizon Europe, notably also the European Innovation Council. It includes a number of improvements to the existing EIT model. They concern: (i) the alignment with the European partnerships under Horizon Europe and their governing rules, (ii) the improvement of the current funding model as recommended by the European Court of Auditors and, (iii) the inclusion of the possibility for the EIT to conclude memoranda of cooperation with KICs to keep former KICs as active members of the EIT Community after the termination of their framework partnership agreement. Clear monitoring and evaluation provisions are defined taking into account the Horizon Europe framework and the EIT’s specificities. Support to KICs The EIT will consolidate the eight existing KICs, fostering their growth and impact, and accompany their transition to financial sustainability. In particular, this will concern the first wave of three KICs launched in 2009 (EIT Climate, EIT Digital and EIT InnoEnergy) whose framework partnership agreements will terminate after 2024. The EIT will also launch two new KICs in specific thematic areas in order to tackle future emerging global societal challenges and needs. The SIA identifies Cultural and Creative Industries as a priority field for a new KIC with a call to be launched in 2021. A second call for a new KIC is foreseen in 2024 to add new priority fields. EIT-coordinated activities The EIT will support 750 higher education institutions through funding, expertise and mentoring, enabling them to develop economic activities in their field of interest and to better integrate into local innovation ecosystems. The EIT Label will be part of the EIT's reinforced focus on education. The EIT will put a strong emphasis on cross-cutting actions such as communication, identification, codification and dissemination of good practices, and international cooperation. Another key area of action for the EIT will be the expansion and strengthening of its regional outreach through the Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS). RIS will offer in particular opportunities to Member States with low innovation performance and enhance their access to the EIT KICs. BUDGETARY IMPACT: the impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 3 billion for the period 2021-2027. The impact on administrative appropriations is estimated at EUR 75 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: as demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, in the event of serious emergencies whose scale and scope affect the whole of the European Union, a collective, coordinated and urgent response is needed to avoid a fragmented approach that would limit the effectiveness of the Union's response. The COVID-19 crisis has shown the need for better European Union preparedness for future large-scale emergencies, while highlighting the limitations of the current framework. In this context, it is proposed to make further amendments to the existing legal framework in order to strengthen the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the period 2021-2027. The Union Mechanism has showed encouraging results in terms of performance in each of the three pillars (prevention/preparedness/response) so far. The Mechanism has proven to be a useful tool to mobilise and coordinate the assistance provided by the Participating States responding to crises inside and outside the Union, constituting a tangible proof of European solidarity. The Mechanism is generally well perceived by the participating States and key stakeholders. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to make certain targeted amendments to Council Decision No 1313/2013/EU on the Union's Civil Protection Mechanism. Building on the principles of solidarity and shared responsibility, the overall objective of this proposal is to ensure that the Union can provide a better crisis and emergency support to its citizens in Europe and beyond. The decision is to be considered in parallel with the proposal also amending this mechanism. In line with the proposal for the new MFF 2021-2027, funding related to civil protection has been integrated into a single heading: Heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’. Objectives Specifically, the proposed amendments have the following objectives: - reinforce a cross-sectoral and societal preparedness approach to trans-boundary disaster risk management, including establishing a baseline and planning elements at a European level; - ensure that the Commission is able to directly procure an adequate safety net of rescEU capacities; - provide the Commission with the logistical capacity to provide multi-purpose air services in case of emergencies and to ensure timely transport and delivery of assistance; d) design a more flexible system for response to large-scale emergencies; - enhance the Emergency Response Coordination Centre’s operational coordination and monitoring role in support of the EU’s swift and effective response to a broad range of crises inside and outside the Union. The ERCC would be operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and would be at the service of the Member States and the Commission in achieving the objectives of the Union's mechanism; - enable stronger investment in preparedness at Union level and further simplification of budget implementation; - enable the financing of operations of efficient and scalable sustainable recovery and resilience measures under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism by external assigned revenues through financing made available under the draft Regulation establishing a European Union Recovery Instrument to support the recovery in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. This proposal envisages the deletion of Annex I, which currently establishes the relative percentages that each pillar of the Union Mechanism (prevention, preparedness and response) should receive in terms of funding from the overall financial envelope. As the COVID-19 outbreak has shown, the percentages outlined in Annex I do not appear to ensure sufficient flexibility so that the Union can achieve the objectives it has set. The proposal stresses the need for close coordination with actions under other EU policies and instruments, in particular with the new EU programme EU4Health. Proposed budget The total budget allocated for the Union Civil Protection Mechanism amounts to EUR 3 455 902 000 (in current prices) for the 2021-2027 period: - EUR 1 268 282 000 shall derive from heading 5 ‘Resilience, Security and Defence’ of the MFF 2021-2027; - EUR 2 187 620 000 shall be made available through the European Recovery Instrument based on empowerment provided in the new Own Resources Decision."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: on 30 January 2020, following the approval of the European Parliament, the Council adopted Decision (EU) 2020/135 on the conclusion of the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community. The withdrawal agreement entered into force on 1 February 2020 and provides for a transitional period during which Union law applies to the United Kingdom and on its territory in accordance with the agreement. This period will end on 31 December 2020. On 25 February 2020, the Council adopted Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/266 authorising the opening of negotiations with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on a new partnership agreement. The Commission was appointed as the Union's negotiator. On 24 December 2020, negotiations were concluded and the Parties agreed on the Trade and Cooperation Agreement and on the Agreement on security procedures for the exchange of classified information and its protection. CONTENT: the draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the Security of Information Agreement fully respect the Treaties and preserve the integrity and the autonomy of the Union legal order. These agreements will not require the EU to amend its rules, regulations or standards in any regulated area. They promote the values, objectives, and interests of the Union, and ensure the consistency, effectiveness and continuity of its policies and actions. The envisaged partnership is based on the recognition of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, as well as the fight against climate change and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Failure to comply with any of these essential elements shall entitle the Parties to terminate or suspend the application of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement or any supplementary agreement, in whole or in part. The Parties also affirm their willingness to ensure a high level of protection of personal data. The draft Trade and Cooperation Agreement consists of three main pillars: Comprehensive and balanced free trade agreement The draft agreement: - covers not just trade in goods and services, but also a broad range of other areas in the EU's interest, such as investment, competition, State aid, tax transparency, air and road transport, energy and sustainability, fisheries, data protection, and social security coordination; - provides for zero tariffs and zero quotas on all goods that comply with the appropriate rules of origin; - ensures a strong level playing field: all imports from the UK should comply with EU rules and regulations (e.g. technical rules and product standards, sanitary and phytosanitary rules, food and safety regulations, health and safety standards, environmental and consumer protection rules); - establishes a new framework for the joint management of fish stocks in their respective waters; - ensures a number of rights of EU citizens and UK nationals. This concerns EU citizens working in, travelling or moving to the UK and to UK nationals working in, travelling or moving to the EU after 1st January 2021; - enables the UK's continued participation in a number of flagship EU programmes for the period 2021-2027 (subject to a financial contribution by the UK to the EU budget), such as Horizon Europe. A new partnership for security The draft agreement establishes a framework for law enforcement and judicial cooperation in criminal matters. It recognises the need for close cooperation between national law enforcement and judicial authorities and EU agencies and bodies, in particular as regards the fight against and prosecution of cross-border crime and terrorism. It respects the status of the United Kingdom as a non-member of the EU outside the Schengen area. Police and judicial cooperation is based on guarantees of respect for democracy and the rule of law, and effective protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, including those enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. There are specific provisions on the suspension of cooperation in the event of serious and systemic failures in the implementation of any of these safeguards, as well as a specific dispute settlement mechanism. A horizontal agreement on governance The governance provisions clarify how the Trade and Cooperation Agreement should be implemented and monitored. The Agreement provides for the possibility for the Parties to take swift, autonomous and operational measures to protect their interests, in particular in the areas of the level playing field (i.e. rebalancing measures, remedial measures) and fisheries (i.e. compensatory measures, remedial measures), as well as, more generally, in cases of serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties of a sectorial or regional nature. The Partnership Council, composed of representatives of the Union and the United Kingdom at ministerial level, should monitor the implementation of the agreement. Security for the exchange of information The draft supplementary agreement on security procedures for the exchange of classified information and its protection sets out rules and modalities for the exchange of classified and unclassified sensitive information. It guarantees the secure treatment of sensitive information, based on the principle of the originator’s consent prior to the release of the information exchanged."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: by virtue of Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007, which entered into force in December 2009, rail passengers have rights to information, reservations and tickets, assistance, care and compensation in the event of a delay or cancellation, free of charge assistance (for persons with disabilities), compensation in the event of an accident or quick access to a complaint handling system. In its 2013 report on the application of the Regulation, the Commission highlighted certain problematic areas which were confirmed by an impact assessment in 2016/2017. With this proposal to recast the existing legislation, the Commission wishes to better protect passengers no matter where they travel in the EU. It aligns rail with general aspects of passenger rights legislation on other transport modes, notably non-discrimination, contingency planning, disability training, complaint handling and enforcement. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: policy options were broken down, in a sequential approach analysing and comparing costs and benefits and selecting a preferred policy scenario per theme: (i) exemptions; (ii) the applicability of the rights of persons with reduced mobility to all services; (iii) information for persons with reduced mobility; (iv) assistance to persons with reduced mobility; (v) handling of complaints and monitoring of enforcement by national enforcement agencies; (vi) definition of throughticket; (viii) force majeure; (ix) information for all travellers; (x) non-discrimination. CONTENT: the main elements of proposal recasting Regulation (EC) No 1371/2007 are as follows: Uniform application of rules : to date, many Member States have frequently used national exemptions, which deprive travellers to a large extent of their rights. The proposal: removes exemptions for long-distance domestic services by 2020; removes exemptions for cross-border urban, suburban and regional services; requires that Member States grant exemptions only if they can prove that passengers are adequately protected on their territory. The Commission proposal updates the existing rules on rail passenger rights in five key areas: Information and non-discrimination : in order to improve provision of information about passenger rights at booking, the proposal: requires such information to be printed on the ticket or electronically. Notices informing passengers of their rights have to be placed in prominent positions in stations and on board; provides for passengers to be given fuller information on through tickets. Railway undertakings and ticket vendors have to make efforts to offer through tickets. They must prove that they informed passengers where their passenger rights do not apply to the whole journey but only to its segments; introduces a general clause prohibiting any form of discrimination, e.g. based on nationality, residence, location or currency of payment. Better rights for persons with disabilities or reduced mobility : mandatory right to assistance on all services and full compensation for loss or repair of mobility equipment. Relevant information has to be given in accessible formats and rail staff must receive disability awareness training. Enforcement, complaint-handling and sanctions : the proposal clarifies the procedure and deadlines for passengers to lodge complaints. It specifies the responsibilities of national enforcement bodies in cross-border cases and requires them to cooperate effectively. Force majeure : in 2013, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the current Regulation does not allow for railway undertakings to be exempted from compensating passengers for delays caused by force majeure, thus creating a distinction between rail and other modes of transport. The proposal introduces a 'force majeure' clause which would exempt railway undertakings from paying compensation for delays only in very exceptional situations caused by severe weather conditions and natural disasters. DELEGATED ACTS: the proposal contains provisions empowering the Commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy is one of the main strategic objectives of the Union. On 12 December 2019, the European Council endorsed the objective of achieving a climate-neutral Union by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. The proposed Regulation implements one of the priorities set out in the Communication of 11 December 2019 on the European Green Deal and is part of the Sustainable Europe Investment Plan, which provides for specific funding under the Just Transition Mechanism in the context of cohesion policy. The Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) shall provide targeted support to the regions and sectors most affected by transition due to their dependence on fossil fuels or industrial processes that are high emitters of greenhouse gases, to help them mobilise at least EUR 100 billion over the period 2021-2027 and thus mitigate the socio-economic impact of transition. The JTM shall be additional to the contribution made by the EU budget through all instruments directly related to the transition, including the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund plus (ESF+). It shall have three main sources of funding: (1) a Just Transition Fund, (2) a dedicated scheme under InvestEU and (3) a Public Sector Loan Facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB). CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims at establishing the Just Transition Fund (JTF), which is one of the pillars of the Just Transition Mechanism implemented under cohesion policy. Subject matter The aim of the JTF is to mitigate the adverse effects of the climate transition by supporting the most affected territories and workers concerned. In line with the JTF specific objective, actions supported by the JTF should directly contribute to alleviate the impact of the transition by financing the diversification and modernisation of the local economy and by mitigating the negative repercussions on employment. Programming The programming process, including the identification of the territories for intervention and corresponding actions will be agreed in a dialogue between the Commission and each Member State. It will be steered by the European Semester process. Taking into account the Commission’s analysis, Member States shall prepare one or more territorial just transition plans, providing an outline of the transition process until 2030, consistent with the National Energy and Climate Plans and the transition to a climate neutral economy and identifying subsequently the most impacted territories that should be supported. The proposal also establishes a framework for measuring the achievements of the JTF using the relevant indicators and a mechanism for adjusting support if the targets are not met. Scope of support The Fund would essentially provide grants to the regions. The projects funded should contribute to a transition to a circular, climate-neutral economy. The Fund would support, inter alia, the following activities: - productive investments in SMEs, including start-ups, leading to economic diversification and reconversion; - investments in research and innovation activities and in fostering the transfer of advanced technologies; - investments in the deployment of affordable clean energy technologies and infrastructure, in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energies; - investments in strengthening the circular economy, including through waste prevention and reduction, resource efficiency, reuse, repair and recycling; - the up-skilling and reskilling of the affected workers, with the aim of helping them to adapt to new employment opportunities, as well as providing jobsearch assistance to jobseekers and their active inclusion into the labour market. Budget The Fund shall be endowed with EUR 7.5 billion (at 2018 prices) for the period 2021-2027 in addition to what the Commission has proposed for the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). It shall support the ""Investment for jobs and growth"" objective of the new regulation on common provisions (CPR) in all Member States. Member States will complement their Just Transition Fund allocation from their resources under the ERDF and the ESF+ through a specific and definitive transfer mechanism. Member States will also provide national resources to complement the Union resources. The level of Union co-financing will be set according to the category of region in which the identified territories are located. The overall financing capacity of this fund will exceed EUR 30 billion and may reach EUR 50 billion."

ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation providing for the continuation of the Pericles programme in the post-2020 multiannual financial framework. Article 139 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that measures governing the use of the euro referred to in Article 133 thereof shall not apply to the Member States with derogation. However, the exchange of information and staff and the assistance and training measures implemented under the Pericles programme should be uniform throughout the Union. The Commission recalled the significant role of non-participating Member States under the current extension of the Pericles 2020 programme. The National bank of Croatia, for instance, organised a series of conferences under the title ‘Balkan network for euro protection’ gathering experts from South East Europe to reinforce the protection of the euro against counterfeiting in this area, known for its distribution and production of euro counterfeits. The Commission therefore considered it necessary to take the necessary measures to ensure the same level of protection for the euro in the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. CONTENT: this proposal aims to extend the Regulation establishing an exchange, assistance and training programme for the protection of the euro against counterfeiting (Pericles IV) to the Member States that do not have the euro as their official currency. Entities from those Member States shall be considered eligible for funding when they are competent authorities within the meaning of the programme."

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to ‘apportion’ the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The basis of this approach is that the existing volume of each TRQ would be fully maintained in the future but split across two separate customs territories: the EU27 and the UK. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows into the EU27 and the UK during a representative reference period for all WTO TRQs. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch GATT Article XXVIII negotiations with the WTO Members concerned with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO tariff quota concessions. The negotiations with Cuba resulted in an agreement in the form of an exchange of letters which was initialled in Geneva on 3 July 2020."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway was negotiated by the Commission, as authorised by the Council on 21 December 2016. This Agreement is based on the Air Transport Agreement (ATA) between the EU and the United States, which was signed on 25 and 30 April 2007. The EU-US ATA is the most important air transport agreement in the world, providing more than 75 million seats per year, and as such a cornerstone of the EU’s external aviation policy. The ATA between the EU and the US foresees an open wet-lease regime between the parties. The negotiating directives set out the general objective of negotiating a Wet Lease Agreement with the aim of providing precision to the relevant provisions of the ATA and abolishing time limitations for wet lease arrangements affecting the EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to authorise, on behalf of the Union, the conclusion of the Agreement on time limitations on arrangements for the provision of aircraft with crew between the United States of America, the European Union, Iceland, and the Kingdom of Norway. The Wet Lease Agreement will resolve a long-standing uncertainty concerning the application of the wet lease provisions of the ATA, and as such contribute to the well-functioning of the transatlantic aviation relationship The Agreement confirms the establishment of clear and non-restrictive wet lease arrangements involving the airlines of the Parties, thereby providing more precision to the respective provisions of the ATA. The Wet Lease Agreement not only resolves the current dispute on the application of the relevant provisions of the ATA, it also provides clarity and legal certainty for future arrangements affecting EU, Icelandic, Norwegian and US air carriers."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Union and its Member States are Parties to the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (the Aarhus Convention). Regulation (EC) No 1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council (the Aarhus Regulation) established provisions to apply the provisions of the Convention to EU institutions and bodies. For the European Green Deal to be successful and bring about lasting change, the public - individuals but also civil society - should remain a driving force in the transition and be given the means to participate actively in the development and implementation of new policies. In its Communication on the European Green Deal, the Commission committed itself to revise the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ to improve access to administrative and judicial review at EU level for citizens and NGOs who have concerns about the legality of decisions affecting the environment and to take measures to improve their access to justice before the national courts in all Member States. In its resolution of 15 January 2020, the European Parliament reaffirmed that it is essential to ensure that EU citizens have genuine access to justice and documents as enshrined in the Aarhus Convention. CONTENT: the proposal aims to revise the administrative review created established in 2006 by the ‘Aarhus Regulation’ for the benefit of NGOs with regard to acts and omissions of an administrative nature by EU institutions and bodies. In concrete terms, the amending proposal: - extends the current possibilities for NGOs to request administrative review: whereas administrative review can currently only be requested for acts of 'individual scope' (which directly concern a person), in future NGOs may also request review of any non-legislative administrative act of 'general scope'; however, the proposal excludes provisions of such acts for which EU law explicitly requires implementing measures at EU or national level; - amends the references to environmental law by providing that, in future, any administrative act which contravenes EU environmental law may be subject to review, irrespective of its policy objectives; however, the proposal does not envisage granting standing for individuals; - extends the deadlines for the internal review procedure to allow for an appropriate quality of submissions, including a two-week extension for NGOs and a four-week extension for EU institutions. Budgetary implications The report and the external study on the functioning of access to justice in environmental matters accompanying the proposal assessed the impact of the different options on the internal resources of the EU institutions, in particular the Commission and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). They concluded that this impact shall be limited if the options introduced by the proposal are followed. The proposed amendments shall not create a new system and shall not lead to an increase in the number of potential applicants for review. Although the expanding of the eligibility requirements may lead to an increase in the current workload, this could be partially compensated by clearer eligibility criteria."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down requirements relating to emission limits for gaseous and particulate pollutants and EU type-approval procedures for various categories of engines for non-road mobile machinery. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Regulation (EU) 2020/1040 of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 was adopted. The aim of this Regulation was to postpone certain deadlines that manufacturers could no longer meet without sustaining serious economic damage due to the unexpected disruptions in the supply chain. This concerned machinery that use so-called ‘transition engines’ in the power range <56kW and >130kW, and whose production had to be completed by 30 June 2020 and placing on the market by 31 December 2020. Under the amended Regulation (EU) 2016/1628, manufacturers were provided with an additional 12 months to produce and place on the market the machinery fitted with those engines. However, due to the continued supply chain and production disruptions caused by the COVID-19 second and third waves, manufacturers will not be able to meet the 2021 deadlines applicable to the machinery fitted with transition engines in the power range between 56kW and 130kW, and above 300kW without sustaining serious economic damage. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to postpone the deadlines to avoid that transition engines can no longer be fitted in the machinery in time and are then scrapped. CONTENT: in view of the current situation and to ensure legal certainty and to avoid possible market disruption, the Commission proposes to extend certain transitional provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/1628 for the construction and placing on the market of machinery equipped with certain transition engines. The extension of the relevant periods should be 6 months for the production of machinery equipped with these engines and 9 months for the placing on the market."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/1240 of the European Parliament and of the Council created the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) for third-country nationals exempt from the requirement to be in possession of a visa when crossing external borders. It laid down the conditions and procedures to issue or refuse a travel authorisation. ETIAS enables consideration of whether the presence of those third-country nationals in the territory of the Member States would pose a security, illegal immigration or high epidemic risk. The ETIAS Regulation provides that the personal data contained in the applications will be compared with the data contained in records, files or alerts: - in alerts recorded in other EU information systems or databases (the ETIAS Central System, the Schengen Information System (SIS), the Visa Information System (VIS), the Entry/Exit System (EES) or Eurodac), and the European Criminal Records Information System for third-country nationals (ECRIS-TCN); - in Europol data; - in the Interpol databases (the Interpol Stolen and Lost Travel Document database (SLTD) or the Interpol Travel Documents Associated with Notices database (TDAWN)). Not all data are collected or recorded in the same way in the other EU information systems and Europol data. For instance, ‘first names of parents of applicants’ are collected by ETIAS, but not in most of the other systems to be queried by ETIAS. In order to enable the verification referred to in Article 20 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1240, it is necessary to amend the legal acts establishing the European Union's information systems to ensure interoperability with ETIAS. Without this interoperability, ETIAS cannot enter into service. CONTENT: the proposal defines the technical amendments necessary to fully set up the ETIAS system. It amends the legal acts establishing the EU information systems that are necessary for establishing their relation with ETIAS. As a result, it is necessary to amend Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EU) 2018/1240, (EC) No 767/2008, (EU) 2017/2226, (EU) 2018/1861 (SIS border) in order to connect the ETIAS Central System to the other EU information systems and to Europol data and to specify the data that will be sent to and from those EU information systems and Europol data. As compared to the ETIAS Regulation, this proposal only specifies in more details which data is to be compared to which data in the other EU information systems and provides with the necessary amendments as regards granting access rights to those other systems to ETIAS Central and National Units. This proposal therefore presents amendments to the ETIAS Regulation to specify that the ETIAS Central System would build upon the EES Central System’s hardware and software components in order to establish a shared identity repository for the storage of the identity alphanumeric data of both ETIAS applicants and third-country nationals registered in EES. This shared identity repository would be the basis for the implementation of the common identity repository once the co-legislators adopt the legislative proposals on the interoperability of information systems. The proposal builds on the Schengen acquis on the crossing of external borders and visas. It therefore takes into account the consequences of the various protocols and agreements signed with the associated countries."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: since the adoption of Regulation (EU) 2019/833 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation (NAFO) has adopted, at its 41st annual meeting, a number of legally binding decisions for the conservation of the fishery resources under its purview. The EU has been a Contracting Party to NAFO since 1979. The NAFO Convention states that the conservation measures adopted by the NAFO Commission are binding and that the contracting parties are required to implement them. Regulation (EU) 2019/833 turned into Union law the NAFO conservation and enforcement measures. This proposal covers most the recent amendments adopted by NAFO. These amendments entered into force for the Union on 2 December 2019 and apply from that date. As far as the Union is concerned, they are to be incorporated into Union law to the extent that they are not already covered by Union law. CONTENT: this proposal aims to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/833 by including the most recent amendments to the Conservation and Enforcement Measures adopted at the NAFO annual meeting in September 2019. These amendments are binding on the Contracting Parties. The proposal: - adapts Regulation (EU) 2019/833 in order to apply the NAFO mesh size measurement standards, to introduce the definition of fishing vessel used by NAFO to allow EU control and enforcement authorities to work in agreement with other NAFO Contracting Parties; - includes NAFO’s editorial changes to a few provisions concerning Greenland halibut, production logbook, cross-references to infringements and infringement procedures. It introduces definitions and reference to the NAFO monitoring, control and surveillance website together with the relevant protocol for granting access to this website; - improves the information flow between the Member States fisheries authorities, the Commission and the NAFO Secretariat and acknowledges the role of the European Fisheries Control Agency in coordinating the inspection means deployed within the NAFO Joint Inspection and Surveillance Scheme; - introduces provisions to protect the Greenland shark; - clarifies the need for the consent of the port State Contracting Party to be given to inspectors of another Contracting Party as well as the chartering arrangements that should apply at NAFO level; - delegates to the Commission powers to amend the NAFO conservation and enforcement provisions on mesh sizes, sorting grids or grates and toggle chains in the Northern prawn fishing, and area restrictions for the bottom fishing activities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of the law, the purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Regulation (EC) No 924/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on cross-border payments in the Community, which has been amended several times and quite substantially. The new Regulation shall supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bringing them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the following: Charges for cross-border payments in euro According to the proposal, charges levied by a payment service provider on a payment service user in respect of cross-border payments in euro shall be the same as the charges levied by that payment service provider for corresponding national payments of the same value in the national currency of the Member State in which the payment service provider of the payment service user is located. In order to facilitate the functioning of the Internal Market, the proposal lays down the principle that payment service providers shall align the charges they levy for cross-border payments in euro with the charges they levy for comparable national payments made in the national currency of the Member State in which they are established, including where the euro is not the national currency of that Member State. Transparency obligations The proposal sets out transparency requirements relating to currency conversion practices. It therefore provides that consumers shall be fully informed of the amount of exchange charges before making a cross-border payment (for example, when using their card abroad, be it a cash withdrawal from an ATM or to pay by card at the point of sale). To allow comparability, currency conversion charges for all card payments shall be expressed in the same way, namely as percentage mark-ups over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank (ECB). These mark-ups shall be communicated to the payer prior to the initiation of the payment transaction. In order to facilitate the automation of payments, banks shall, where appropriate: (i) communicate to the user the user's International Payment Account Number Identifier (IBAN) and the bank's Business Identifier Code (BIC); (ii) indicate on the statement of accounts or in an annex to the statements, the user's IBAN and the bank's BIC. Compliance with obligations The proposal obliges Member States to provide for complaint procedures for alleged infringements of this Regulation, as well as effective out-of-court redress procedures for the settlement of disputes. Penalties may be imposed for infringements."

Given the approval of the Council and the European Commission’s favourable opinion, Parliament adopted the regulation laying down the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties. In concrete terms, the proposed regulation: - sets out the conditions under which a complaint can be made to the Ombudsman; - provides for procedures to be followed when the Ombudsman's enquiries reveal maladministration; - allow the Ombudsman, without prejudice to his or her primary duty, which is to handle complaints, to conduct own-initiative inquiries whenever he or she finds grounds, and in particular in repeated, systemic or particularly serious instances of maladministration; - provides for the possibility for the Ombudsman to conduct an enquiry to identify maladministration in the context of raising alerts. The Ombudsman should have access to all elements required for the performance of his or her duties. To that end, the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies should provide the Ombudsman with any information that he or she requests for the purposes of an inquiry. The Ombudsman and his or her staff should be obliged to treat in confidence any information which they have acquired in the course of their duties, without prejudice to the Ombudsman's obligation to inform the authorities of the Member States of facts which might relate to criminal offences and have come to his or her attention in the course of an inquiry. The Ombudsman should also be able to inform the Union institution, body, office or agency concerned of the facts that call into question the conduct of a member of their staff. Where necessary for the effective performance of his or her duties, the Ombudsman should be given the possibility to cooperate and exchange information with the authorities of the Member States, in compliance with the applicable national and Union law, and with other Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, in particular those responsible for the defence and protection of fundamental rights. The draft regulation stipulates that the Ombudsman should be appointed by the European Parliament at the beginning of the parliamentary term and for the duration thereof, chosen from among persons who are citizens of the Union and who offer all requisite guarantees of independence and competence. General conditions should also be laid down inter alia concerning the cessation of the Ombudsman's duties, the replacement of the Ombudsman, incompatibilities, the remuneration of the Ombudsman and the privileges and immunities of the Ombudsman. The seat of the Ombudsman should be that of the European Parliament."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down rules ensuring the right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to the processing of personal data in exchanges of data in the electronic communication sector. Protecting children online is one of the EU's priorities. On 24 July 2020, the Commission adopted an EU strategy for a more effective fight against child sexual abuse which aims to provide an effective response, at Union level, to the crime of child sexual abuse. It announced that it shall propose the necessary legislation to tackle child sexual abuse online effectively by the second quarter of 2021. Certain providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services are already using specific technologies to detect child sexual abuse on their services and report it to law enforcement authorities and to organisations acting in the public interest against child sexual abuse, and/or to remove child sexual abuse material. These organisations refer to national hotlines for reporting child sexual abuse material, as well as organisations whose purpose is to reduce child sexual exploitation. The ePrivacy Directive does not contain an explicit legal basis for voluntary processing of content or traffic data for the purpose of detecting sexual abuse of children online. However, it does provide that Member States may adopt legislative measures to limit the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in this Directive, which concern the confidentiality of communications and traffic data, for the purpose of the prevention and detection of offences related to sexual abuse of children. Lack of Union action on this issue would risk creating fragmentation shall Member States adopt diverging national legislation. Pending the adoption of the announced long-term legislation, the Commission considers that it is essential to take immediate action to enable the continuation of some current activities to combat sexual abuse of children online. CONTENT: the proposal aims to introduce a temporary and strictly limited derogation from the applicability of certain obligations of the ePrivacy Directive to enable providers of number-independent interpersonal communications services to continue using specific technologies and continue their current activities to the extent necessary to detect and report child sexual abuse online and remove child sexual abuse material on their services from December 2020, pending the adoption of the announced long-term legislation. The proposal therefore contains safeguards to ensure that technologies benefitting from the derogation meet the standards of the best practices currently applied, and thereby limits the intrusiveness to the confidentiality of communications and the risk of circumvention. The personal and other data used when carrying out the activities covered by the derogation set out in this Regulation, as well as the period during which the data is subsequently retained in case of positive results, shall be minimised so as to ensure that the derogation remains limited to what is strictly necessary. The providers shall publish reports on an annual basis on the processing falling within the scope of this Regulation. The proposed Regulation shall apply from 21 December 2020 and shall cease to apply in December 2025. If the long-term legislation announced by the Commission is adopted and enters into force before that date, it shall repeal this Regulation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Directive (EU) 2017/2397 lays down transitional measures concerning the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued before 18 January 2022 (the day following the expiry of the period for the transposition of the Directive). In general, the documents concerned remain valid on the EU inland waterways for which they were valid before that date, for a maximum of 10 years. However, apart from the Rhine navigation licences referred to in Directive 96/50/EC, those transitional measures do not apply to the certificates of qualification, service record books and logbooks issued by third countries that are currently recognised by Member States under their national requirements established before the entry into force of the Directive or their international agreements. Consequently, from 17 January 2022, third country documents will be recognised in the EU only once the Commission has adopted an implementing act under the Directive granting recognition in the EU to the documents issued by that third country. Given that the procedure for recognition of third country documents is based on the assessment of the certification systems in the requesting third country, it is unlikely that the recognition procedure will be completed before 17 January 2022. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to introduce transitional provisions applicable to third country documents recognised in certain Member States before 18 January 2022, in order to ensure a smooth transition to the system of recognition of third country documents provided for in Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and to avoid any disruption of the labour market in the inland waterway transport sector. CONTENT: the proposal provides for the possibility for Member States to continue to recognise third country documents based on their national requirements established before the entry into force of Directive (EU) 2017/2397 (16 January 2018). The recognition should be limited to inland waterways situated in the territory of the Member State concerned and should not apply beyond 17 January 2032. The scope of this transitional measure could only cover documents issued by a third country before the cut-off date (18 January 2023). The proposed amendment clarifies that certificates of qualification issued by a third country in exchange for the certificates covered by the transitional arrangements should be valid on all inland EU waterways, provided that the third country concerned has obtained recognition in accordance with Directive (EU) 2017/2397 and that the requirements for the exchange applied by that third country have been found to be identical to those laid down in the Directive with regard to the Member States."

The Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) provides information, assistance and expertise on fundamental rights issues and promotes and protects fundamental rights in the EU. The amendment to the scope simply reflects the consequence of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty for the scope of the Agency’s activities, which became ‘Union law’ instead of ‘Community law’, and therefore encompasses the area of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters (the former so-called “third pillar” of the European Union).

Regulation BACKGROUND: over recent years, security threats have intensified and diversified in Europe. Terrorism, serious and organised crime, itinerant crime, drug trafficking, corruption, cybercrime, trafficking in human beings and arms, among others, continue to challenge the internal security of the Union. The challenges the Union is facing, notably from international terrorism, cannot be managed by individual Member States alone and without the financial and technical support of the EU. Security has an inherently cross-border dimension and therefore a strong, coordinated Union response is required. Financial support provided under this Regulation shall contribute in particular to strengthening national and Union capabilities in the security area. The Commission proposes to multiply EU funding for internal security by factor of 1.8 compared to the current period (2014-2020), so as to ensure a high level of security within the Union while strengthening the role of decentralised agencies in this area. The new internal security fund builds on the investments and achievements of its predecessor instruments: (i) the security and safeguarding liberties programme; (ii) the instrument for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management (ISF-P) and (iii) the drugs component of the Justice programme. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The proposed scope builds largely on the current Regulation for the Internal Security Fund-Police, while taking into account new policy developments, such as the European security agenda, the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime, and the new interoperability agenda. Objectives : the new enhanced fund shall contribute to a high level of security in the Union, in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime. Its specific objectives shall be to: increase the exchange of information among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant Union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; intensify cross-border joint operations among and within the Union law enforcement and other competent authorities in relation to serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; support effort at strengthening the capabilities in relation to combating and preventing crime including terrorism in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the Member States. Actions funded shall be implemented in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. Actions limited to maintaining public order at national level shall not be eligible. Member State support : the allocation of the funding to the programmes of the Member States shall be based on a distribution key of three criteria: (i) the gross domestic product; (ii) size of the territory and; (iii) population of the state. It is proposed to weigh the different criteria as follows: 45% to inverse proportion to the gross domestic product, 40% to proportion to the size of population and 15% to proportion to the size of the territory of the Member State. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for projects with real European added value or to meet urgent needs and emergency funding to Member States. Coordination between EU policies : the enhanced ISF shall be coherent with and complementary to other Union financial programmes, notably the cohesion policy funds and Horizon Europe, as well as the Integrated Border Management Fund and the Asylum and Migration Fund. Furthermore, work under the internal security fund shall be consistent with that of the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The Commission proposes to allocate an amount of EUR 1.12 billion (in current prices) to EU agencies in the field of security. The proposed Regulation does not cover the funding for these agencies. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 2.5 billion (in current prices) to the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. The financial envelope shall be used as follows: EUR 1.5 billion allocated to Member States to enable them to build long-term resilience in the field of security; EUR 1 billion allocated to the thematic mechanism to address unforeseen security challenges and to enable a rapid response to emergency situations."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 provides that the Union budget should continue to support fisheries and maritime affairs policies. Europe's maritime sector employs over 5 million jobs generating almost EUR 500 billion a year, with a potential to create many more jobs. The output of the global ocean economy is estimated at EUR 1.3 trillion and this could more than double by 2030. Fisheries are vital to the livelihood and cultural heritage of many coastal communities in the EU and an essential part of their cultural heritage. Along with aquaculture, it also contributes to food security and nutrition. EU support is a key tool for sustainable fisheries and the conservation of the sea's biological resources, for food security through the supply of seafood, for the growth of a sustainable blue economy and for healthy, safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans, notably in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

The new Fund shall support the environmental, economic, social and employment objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), promote the implementation of the Union's maritime policy and support the Union's international commitments in the field of ocean governance. The fund's support shall be based on four priorities: 1. Fostering sustainable fisheries and the conservation of marine biological resources : support from the EMFF shall aim to achieve and maintain sustainable fishing based on the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and to minimise the negative impacts of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem with particular attention to small-scale fishermen. That support shall include innovation and investments in low-impact, climate resilient and low-carbon fishing practices and techniques. Support for fleet adaptation remains sometimes necessary with regard to certain fleet segments and sea basins. Such support should be tightly targeted to the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and aimed to achieve balance between the fishing capacity and the available fishing opportunities. 2. Contributing to food security in the Union through competitive and sustainable aquaculture and markets : the EMFF may support the promotion and the sustainable development of aquaculture, including freshwater aquaculture, for the farming of aquatic animals and plants for the production of food and other raw material. Public health actions, aquaculture stock insurance schemes and animal health and welfare actions shall also be eligible. 3. Enabling the growth of a sustainable blue economy and fostering prosperous coastal communities : the fund shall support community-led local development under shared management to stimulate economic diversification in a local context through the development of coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture and a sustainable blue economy. It shall also support the collection, management and use of data to improve knowledge of the state of the marine environment. 4. Strengthening international ocean governance and enabling safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed seas and oceans : the EU plays a leading role in particular in preventing, deterring and eradicating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, improving the international framework for ocean governance, reducing pressures on oceans and seas, creating the conditions for a sustainable blue economy and strengthening international ocean research and data. The EMFF shall support these international commitments and objectives under direct management. The EMFF shall also contribute to achieving the Union's environmental objectives in the light of the Commission's proposal to increase the total share of EU spending contributing to climate objectives to 25%. Simplification : under the proposal, the EMFF beyond 2020 shall evolve towards a simplified architecture. Its effectiveness shall be improved by (i) allowing Member States to target support based on their strategic priorities; (ii) better targeting of support for the CFP; and (iii) better alignment with other EU funds since the rules applicable to all structural and investment funds are laid down in a Common Provisions Regulation. In concrete terms, the EMFF shall co-finance projects alongside national funding streams with each Member State receiving a share of the total budget. Member States would prepare their national operational programmes indicating how they intend to spend the funds. Once these programmes have been approved by the Commission, the national authorities would decide which projects they wish to finance. Proposed budget : the proposed overall budget for the EMFF amounts, in current prices, to EUR 6.14 billion, of which (i) EUR 5.31 billion allocated to support under shared management by the Member States through EMFF programmes based on national strategies and (ii) EUR 829 million to direct management. Concerning shared management, after having deducted the value of the UK programme (EUR 243 million), Member States would retain, in nominal terms, 96.5% of their 2014-2020 allocation. In order to ensure stability in particular with regard to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP, the definition of national allocations will be based on the 2014-2020 shares."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the European Union needs modern and efficient infrastructures that contribute to the interconnection and integration of the Union and all its regions in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors. Trans-European networks and cross-border cooperation are not only essential for the functioning of the single market, but also strategic for the achievement of energy unification, the completion of the digital single market and the development of sustainable modes of transport. Since 2014, the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) has supported investments in the trans-European infrastructure (TEN) in transport, energy and the digital sector. Building on the positive results of the implementation of the CEF in the period 2014-2020, the Commission proposes to extend the CEF programme beyond 2020 with a view to accelerating investment in the field of trans-European networks and to leverage funding from both the public and the private sectors. For the period 2021-2027, the Commission proposes to enhance the environmental dimension of the CEF, by setting the target of 60% of its envelope to climate objectives, in line with the Union's commitments to implement the Paris Agreement, and the commitment to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the Connecting Europe Facility. It lays down the objectives of the Programme, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. The new programme shall aim to develop and modernise the trans-European networks in the fields of transport, energy and digital and to facilitate cross-border cooperation in the field of renewable energy, taking into account the long-term decarbonisation commitments and with emphasis on synergies among sectors. (1) Transport sector : the facility shall contribute to the completion of both layers of the trans-European transport network: the TEN-T core network by 2030 and the TEN-T comprehensive network by 2050. It is estimated that the completion of the TEN-T core network by 2030 will generate 7.5 million job-years between 2017 and 2030 and an additional GDP increase of 1.6 % in the Union in 2030. It shall also support the deployment of European traffic management systems for all traffic modes, in particular for air transport and railways, and helps the EU transition towards smart, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure mobility (for example by establishing a European network of charging infrastructure for alternative fuels). Part of the budget would be reserved for Member States eligible for the Cohesion Fund. With a view to adapting the European transport network to military requirements and improving military mobility in the EU, the mechanism shall support dual-use civil and military transport infrastructure. (2) Energy sector : emphasis shall be placed on: completing the trans-European energy networks through the development of projects of common interest relating to further integration of the internal energy market and interoperability of networks across borders and sectors; security of supply inter alia through the smartening and digitalisation of the infrastructure; cooperation between Member States on cross-border renewable energy projects to promote strategic uptake of marketable renewable energy technologies. (3) Digital sector : the CEF shall support European households’ access to very high capacity networks. In addition, it shall ensure that all main socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, transport hubs, main providers of public services and digitally intensive enterprises have access to future-oriented broadband connections (1 Gbit/second) by 2025. It contributes to the overall connectivity of the European territories, including that of the outermost regions, to the Internet. Actions in support of the deployment of backbone electronic communications networks, including submarine cables connecting European territories to third countries on other continents or connecting European islands or overseas territories to the mainland, shall be eligible. The strategic objectives of the programme shall also be implemented through financial instruments and budgetary guarantees under the opportunities offered by the InvestEU Fund. Programme actions shall be used to address market failures or investment deficits without duplicating efforts and shall have a clear European added value. Proposed budget : in line with the Commission proposal for the post 2020 multiannual financial framework, the Connecting Europe Facility shall be allocated EUR 42.265 billion in current prices for the period 2021-2027: Transport : EUR 30.615 billion, of which: (i) general envelope: EUR 12.830 billion; (ii) contribution from the Cohesion Fund: EUR 11.285 billion; (iii) support for military mobility: EUR 6.5 billion."

Parliament gave its consent to the draft Council decision. The Research Fund for Coal and Steel (RFCS) is an EU funding programme that finances research projects in the coal and steel sectors. The RFCS has its own legal bases standing outside the Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission proposal foresees amendments to the current Decision 2003/76/EC. It aims to allow for the sale of part of the assets of the ECSC in liquidation for the period 2021-2027 in order to provide an annual allocation to the RFCS of EUR 111 million to finance research in the coal and steel sectors, namely: - EUR 40 billion to fund collaborative research in these sectors and; - EUR 71 billion to fund research into breakthrough technologies leading to near zero-carbon steel making and research projects for managing the just transition of formerly operating coal mines or coal mines in the process of closure, and related infrastructure in line with the Just Transition Mechanism. The proposal does not create any new liabilities to be charged to the General Budget under the current multiannual financial framework (MFF). With the exception of some carry-over due to payment requests still to be satisfied within the annual allocation, the assets will stabilise after 2027 and will not be further reduced. In other words, based on the proposal the assets left intact after 2027 should still be intact in 2050, bar the (positive or negative) effect of the ECSC portfolio performance."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament's position adopted at first reading under the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission's proposal as follows. Scope of the Visa Information System (VIS) Members believe that the proposed reform shall be the extension of the scope of the Visa Information System (VIS) to include long-stay visas and residence permits. This change shall increase the security of external borders and better secure the rights of long-term residents. Purpose of the VIS As regards short-stay visas, the VIS shall facilitate the exchange of data between Member States on visa applications and decisions, with a view to facilitating and accelerating the visa application procedure. With regard to long-stay visas and residence permits, the VIS shall: (i) support a high level of security in all Member States by contributing to the assessment of whether the applicant or holder of a document is considered to pose a threat to public policy, internal security; (ii) facilitate checks at external border crossing points and enhance the effectiveness of checks within the territory of the Member States. For all visas, the VIS shall assist in the identification of missing persons and contribute the prevention of threats to the internal security of any of the Member States, namely through the prevention, detection and investigation of terrorist offences or of other serious criminal offences in appropriate and strictly defined circumstances. Members proposed that Council Decision 2004/512/EC establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) be repealed and fully integrated into the VIS Regulation. The architecture of the system shall also reflect the expansion of its scope and usage: long stay visas and residence permits, queries by the entry-exit system and the new interoperability architecture. The VIS would be based on a centralised architecture. The central VIS system, the uniform national interfaces, the web service, the carrier gateway and the VIS communication infrastructure shall share and re-use as much as technically possible the hardware and software components of respectively the entry/exist central (EES Central System), the EES national uniform interfaces, the ETIAS carrier gateway, the EES web service and the EES communication infrastructure. Data processing Processing of personal data within the VIS by each competent authority shall not result in discrimination against applicants, visa holders or applicants and holders of long-stay visas, and residence permits on the grounds of sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation. It shall fully respect human dignity and integrity and fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, including the right to respect for one’s private life and to the protection of personal data. Particular attention shall be paid to children, the elderly and persons with a disability and persons in need of international protection. Children's fingerprints Given that children are a particularly vulnerable group, Members propose that the collection of special categories of data, such as fingerprints, from children should be subject to stricter safeguards and a limitation of the purposes for which these data may be used to situations where it is in the child’s best interests, including by limiting the retention period for data storage. Data transfer Personal data obtained by a Member State pursuant to this Regulation should not be transferred or made available to any third country, international organisation or private entity established in or outside the Union. As an exception to that rule, however, it should be possible to transfer such personal data to a third country or to an international organisation where such a transfer is subject to strict conditions and necessary in individual cases in order to assist with the identification of a third-country national in relation to his or her return. Access to the system by centralised European agencies In the case of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, Members believe it is essential that this agency has access to the system. However, they proposed restricting access for return teams while reinforcing access to statistics for the purpose of risk analysis. Links with other systems and interoperability Members intend to ensure the utmost coherence with other systems, in particular ETIAS, including its safeguards. Checks against other databases should also be carried out for holders of long-stay visas and residence permits. However, in order to provide appropriate guarantees, Members specified which controls should be carried out. They also specified the specific measures following each hit, both to protect third-country nationals and to ensure the confidentiality of information. Any hit resulting from the queries which cannot automatically be confirmed by VIS shall be manually verified by the national single point of contact. Depending on the type of data triggering the hit, the hit should be assessed either by consulates or by a national single point of contact, with the latter being responsible for hits generated in particular bylaw enforcement databases or systems. Each Member State shall designate a national authority, operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, which shall ensure the relevant manual verifications and assessment of hits for the purposes of this Regulation. Entry into force Members proposed enhancing reporting mechanisms and setting a deadline of a maximum of two years to have this reformed VIS up and running."

Reform of the Visa Information System The Regulation amending the Visa Information System (VIS) aims to further develop the VIS to better respond to new challenges in the field of visa, border and security policies. The amending regulation has the following objectives: - to facilitate the visa application procedure; - to strengthen background checks before a decision is taken on a short or long stay visa and residence permit, as well as identity checks at external border crossing points and on the territory of the Member States; and - to enhance the internal security of the Schengen area by facilitating the exchange of information between Member States on third-country nationals holding a long-stay visa or residence permit. The technical amendments to the regulations that form part of the Schengen acquis related to external borders (VIS, Entry/Exit System (EES), European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), SIS Return, SIS Borders and Border Interoperability) are contained in the Regulation amending the VIS. Consequential amendments The proposed Regulation lays down the conditions under which the VIS consults data stored in Eurodac, SIS and the European Criminal Records Information System for Third Country Nationals (ECRIS-TCN), as well as Europol data, for the purpose of identifying hits in the context of the automated searches specified in the Regulation amending the VIS. The adoption of a separate legal instrument was necessary because of the variable geometry of Member States' participation in EU policies in the area of freedom, security and justice. The Consequential Amendments Regulation provides for the conditions under which, on the one hand, the visa authorities are able to consult data stored in Eurodac and, on the other, the VIS designated authorities are able to consult Europol data, certain SIS data and data stored in ECRIS-TCN for the purposes of the VIS should be safeguarded by clear and precise rules regarding the access by those authorities to those data, the type of queries and categories of data, all of which should be limited to what is strictly necessary for the performance of the duties of those authorities. In the same vein, the data stored in the VIS application file should be visible only to those Member States that are operating the underlying information systems in accordance with the arrangements for their participation. The Europol Regulation will be amended in order to: - allow Europol to give an opinion following a consultation by the VIS in the context of automated processing, and - allow VIS authorities designated for the purposes of the VIS Regulation to have indirect access to Europol data on the basis of a hit/no hit system. The ECRIS-TCN Regulation is amended to: - include in the data file of a convicted third-country national an indication, for the purposes of the VIS, of whether that national has been convicted of a terrorist offence or a serious criminal offence; - indicate that the flags will be automatically erased 25 years after its creation, as regards convictions for terrorist offences, and 15 years after its creation, as regards convictions for other serious criminal offences; - make the details and code of the convicting Member State(s) accessible and searchable by the central VIS system for the purpose of verifications, when hits are identified as a result of automated processing by the VIS; - authorise, in the event of a hit, the Central System or the Common Identity Data Directory (CIR) to automatically indicate to the competent authority the Member States holding information on the criminal record of the third-country national concerned; - connect the ECRIS-TCN to the European Search Portal (ESP) created by Regulation (EU) 2019/818 in order to enable automated processing by the VIS; - granting designated VIS authorities a right of access to the ECRIS-TCN data contained in the CIR for the purpose of carrying out the tasks provided for in the VIS Regulation; and - keep a log of each ECRIS-TCN data processing operation carried out in the CIR and in the VIS."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: effective protection of the EU's external borders is an essential precondition for managing migration flows and ensuring internal security. Strong external borders are also what allow the EU to maintain a Schengen area without internal border controls. Financial support from the Union budget is essential for the implementation of integrated European border management as implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard, set up by Regulation (EU) 2016/1624 of the European Parliament and of the Council. In order to respond to increased migratory and security challenges, the Commission has proposed the establishment of a new integrated border management fund under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. This new fund aims to provide enhanced support to Member States with a view to securing the Union’s common external borders, with an envelope of EUR 9.31 billion (in current prices). A five-fold increase as compared to the current multiannual financial framework for the overall envelope for border management is foreseen for the next period. Within that framework, the proposed integrated border management fund shall be composed of two instruments: an instrument for financial support for border management and visa and an instrument for financial support for customs control equipment. This proposal concerns only the instrument for border management and visa. A separate proposal covering the instrument for customs control equipment is presented by the Commission in parallel. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the instrument for financial support for border management and visa as part of the integrated border management fund. It lays down the objectives of the instrument, the budget for the period 2021-2027, the forms of Union funding and the rules for providing such funding. Objective : the instrument shall ensure strong and effective European integrated border management at the external borders while safeguarding the free movement of persons within it, in full compliance with the Union’s commitments on fundamental rights, thereby contributing to guaranteeing a high level of security in the Union. Its specific objectives are to: support effective European integrated border management at the external borders implemented by the European Border and Coast Guard as a shared responsibility of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency and of the national authorities responsible for border management, to facilitate legitimate border crossings, to prevent and detect illegal immigration and cross-border crime and to effectively manage migratory flows; support the common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel and prevent migratory and security risks: the instrument shall contribute to the improvement of the efficiency of visa processing in terms of detecting and assessing security and irregular migration risks, as well as facilitating visa procedures for bona fide travellers. In particular, the instrument shall deliver financial assistance to support digitalisation of visa processing with the objective to provide fast, secure and client-friendly visa procedures for the benefit of both visa applicants and consulates. Priority shall be given to supporting actions with a European dimension. Support to Member States : in addition to a basic amount of EUR 5 million that is envisaged to be allocated to Member States at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of Member States shall be allocated based on a distribution key that shall reflect the needs and pressure experienced by Member States in the two areas covered by this instrument (border management and visas). Funding shall be distributed based on the following weighing: 30% for external land borders, 35% for external sea borders, 20% for airports and 15% for consular offices. A mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. The remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for a number of priorities defined in Commission financing decisions. The instrument shall furthermore maintain support for the functioning of the Special Transit Scheme implemented by Lithuania, in line with the EU’s obligations, compensating Lithuania for the transit visa fees it foregoes and additional costs it incurs as a result of the facilitated transit document (FTD) and facilitated rail transit document (FRTD) scheme, such as the costs of replacing and upgrading equipment and IT systems, and training and operational costs. Proposed budget : the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes EUR 8.01 billion (in current prices) for the instrument for border management and visa for the 2021-2027 period. Implementation shall be by means of shared, direct or indirect management. The global resources shall be allocated as follows: EUR 4.81 billion (around 60%) for measures taken by Member States in border management and visa policy, including EUR 157.2 million for the special transit scheme applied by Lithuania; EUR 3.20 billion (40%) for the thematic facility for targeted support actions to Member States, projects with a European dimension and urgent needs."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) and the Commission have carried out an analysis to determine whether there are, for the species of asparagus as well as for species groups of flower bulbs, woody small fruits and woody ornamentals, technical difficulties in breeding which require expenditure on research activities over a long period of time, if the multiplication of propagating material takes time, if the new varieties have a commercial value only in the long term and if the return on investment of the research activities is only possible at a fairly late stage of protection compared to other horticultural or agricultural crops. The analysis carried out shows that, for the species concerned, the term of protection should be extended by five years in order to establish a legal environment conducive to an equitable remuneration of research and breeding activities. CONTENT: the proposal for a regulation aims to extend the term of Community plant variety rights from 25 to 30 years for species of asparagus as well as for species groups flower bulbs, woody small fruits and woody ornamental crops. To this end, the proposed Regulation extends the term of protection for the species concerned by five years. This extension would apply to protection granted before, on or after 1 July 2021. It is also proposed to reduce the duration of the extension if national property rights for these varieties have been effective in a Member State prior to the grant of a Community plant variety right and, accordingly, would already have allowed breeders to exploit their varieties."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the United Kingdom left the European Union on 1 February 2020. Even with the new EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement in place, there will be big changes at the end of the transition period on 1 January 2021. On that date, the UK will leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union, as well as all EU policies and international agreements. It will put an end to the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital with the EU. The EU and the UK will form two separate markets; two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. This will recreate barriers to trade in goods and services and to cross-border mobility and exchanges that have not existed for decades – in both directions, affecting public administrations, businesses, citizens and stakeholders on both sides. This will have broad and far-reaching consequences for businesses, citizens and public administrations. The Commission has been working with the Member States and their administrations to help preparations and boost readiness. The European Council conclusions, agreed at its special meeting of 17-21 July 2020, to provide for the establishment of a new special Brexit Adjustment Reserve ‘to counter unforeseen and adverse consequences in Member States and sectors that are worst affected'. The Reserve would be complementary and ensure synergies with other Union programmes and funding instruments. It will concentrate its resources specifically and exclusively on the direct effect of the specific and unprecedented event of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union, reducing its impact in terms of territorial cohesion. PURPOSE: the proposed Brexit Adjustment Reserve should provide support to Member States, regions and sectors, in particular those that are worst affected by the adverse consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU. It should cover all Member States. The period of eligibility for direct public expenditure will run from 1 July 2020 to 31 December 2022. Sector support The proposed Reserve should support measures specifically set up in relation to the withdrawal of the UK from the Union. They may include the following: - support to economic sectors, business and local communities, including those dependent on fishing activities in the UK waters; - support to employment and reintegration in the labour market of citizens returning from the UK, including through short-time work schemes, re-skilling and training; - ensuring the functioning of border, customs, sanitary and phytosanitary and security controls, fisheries control, certification and authorisation regimes, communication, information and awareness raising for citizens and businesses. Submission and assessment of applications for financial contribution from the Reserve To ensure equal treatment of all Member States, there should be one single deadline applicable to all Member States for the submission of applications for a financial contribution from the Reserve. This deadline is the 30 September 2023. Following the application, the Commission should examine the eligibility and accuracy of the expenditure declared, its link to the end of the transition period and its economic effects, and the measures put in place to avoid double financing as well as the supporting documents. Where the expenditure accepted as eligible exceeds the amount paid in pre-financing and 0.06% of the nominal GNI of 2021, additional amounts from the Reserve may be paid to contribute to the exceeding amounts, within the limits of the financial resources available. The amounts recovered or carried over from the pre-financing may be used for reimbursement of additional expenditure by Member States, provided there is a demand. Reporting By 30 June 2027, the Commission should present an implementation report of the Reserve to the European Parliament and the Council. Budgetary implications The maximum resources for the implementation of the Reserve should be EUR 5 370 994 000 in current prices, to be financed as a special instrument outside of the EU budget ceilings of the Multiannual Financial Framework. The support should be disbursed in two allocation rounds. The first, more substantial one (EUR 4 244 832 000) should be activated in 2021 in the form of pre-financing. The second round (EUR 1 126 162 000) should be allocated and disbursed in 2024 for additional contributions in line with the provisions of the present proposal. The budget allocated to the Reserve should be implemented under shared management with the Member States, guaranteeing full respect of the principles of sound financial management, transparency and non-discrimination and the absence of conflict of interest. Lastly, in order to avoid extra financial and administrative burdens on the Member States, Member States could also roll over existing systems already used for the management and control of cohesion policy funding or the European Union Solidarity Fund."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 231/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA II) expires on 31 December 2020. In order to safeguard the effectiveness of the Union's external actions, the Commission proposes to maintain a framework for the planning and delivering external assistance under the next multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. The Commission considers it essential to maintain a dedicated instrument in support of enlargement policy, while ensuring its complementarity with the general objectives of the Union's external action and in particular those of the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The enlargement process is based on well-established criteria (""the Copenhagen criteria"") and fair and rigorous conditionality. The objective of the proposed instrument is to provide increased assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries to pursue the necessary far-reaching reforms. In November 2015, the European Commission set out a medium-term strategy for the Union's enlargement policy, which remains valid today. The current enlargement agenda covers the partners of the Western Balkans and Turkey. On 17 April 2018, the European Commission recommended to the Council the opening of accession negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania in light of the progress achieved. The Commission reaffirmed the firm, merit-based prospect of Union membership for the Western Balkans. It is also keen to continue the dialogue with Turkey on a number of key areas of common interest such as economic and trade relations, energy, transport, migration and asylum, foreign policy, security and the fight against terrorism. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation - presented for a Union of 27 Member States - seeks to establish the instrument for pre-accession assistance (IPA III) programme for the period 2021-2027. IPA III shall support the beneficiary countries in adopting and implementing the political, institutional, legal, administrative, social and economic reforms required by those beneficiaries to comply with Union values and to progressively align to Union rules, standards, policies and practices with a view to Union membership. IPA III shall be clearly positioned in the context of the new Western Balkans strategy, and reflect the developments in the relations with Turkey. As regards political priorities, IPA III shall focus on the main priorities set out in the enlargement policy and relevant strategy papers, namely: the rule of law, fundamental rights and governance, socio-economic development, EU policies and acquis, and people-to-people contacts, as well as reconciliation, good neighbourly relations and regional cooperation. In addition to these priorities already included in IPA II, other key issues such as migration, security, environmental protection and climate change are more visibly addressed in the proposal. Programming framework : this shifts the focus from partner allocations to performance in achieving the objectives. Assistance will continue to be targeted and adjusted to the specific situation of the beneficiaries. However, access to funds should, in addition to a principle of ‘fair share’, be based on criteria such as project/programme maturity, expected impact and progress on the rule of law, fundamental rights and governance. Proposed budget : the European Commission has proposed an amount of EUR 14.5 billion (in current prices) for the new instrument for pre-accession assistance for the period 2021-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Special Partnership between the EU and Cabo Verde was approved by the Council of the European Union on 19 November 2007. One of its objectives is to increase mobility and people-to-people contacts between citizens of the Union and Cabo Verde, as well as to strengthen cooperation in the fight against illegal immigration. On 1 December 2014, the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of issuance of short-stay visas to citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union entered into force. After almost 5 years of implementation of these Agreements and in light of the supervened changes of both the EU and Cabo Verde’s domestic legislation related to visas, namely the revision of the EU’s Visa Code 3 and Cabo Verde decision to exempt EU citizens from the visa requirement for stays up to 30 days, the Joint Committee set up by the existing agreement explored the need to amend certain rules thereby established, with a view to adapt it to the changed circumstances. On that basis, the Commission presented on 13 September 2019, a recommendation to the Council with a view to obtaining directives to negotiate an Agreement amending the existing Visa Facilitation Agreement with the Republic of Cabo Verde. The Council having given its authorisation, the chief negotiators reached an agreement in principle on the draft text of the agreement, initialled on 24 July 2020 through an exchange of e-mails. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council approve the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cabo Verde amending the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Cape Verde on the facilitation of the issuance of short-stay visas to the citizens of the Republic of Cape Verde and the European Union. The purpose of the agreement is to facilitate, on the basis of reciprocity, the issuance of visas for an intended stay of no more than 90 days in any 180-day period. The agreement provides for the following: - the reduction of the visa fee for processing applications to 75% of the amount to be charged in accordance with the applicable domestic (i.e. EUR 60 for Cabo Verdean citizens); for children of at least 12 years of age (but under 18 years of age), the fee is further reduced by 50% compared to the generally applicable amount (i.e. EUR 30 for Cabo Verdean citizens); - simplification of the documents required to justify the purpose of the journey for certain categories of applicants, e.g. business people; spouses, children and parents of Union citizens or Cabo Verdean citizens legally residing in the EU; schoolchildren, students; participants in scientific, cultural, sporting or religious events, journalists and persons travelling for medical reasons; - the modification of the rules on the issuing of multiple-entry visas focusing on the previous lawful use of the visa during a given reference period rather than on the purpose of travel of the applicants; - the exemption from the visa requirement for short stays for holders of a valid EU laissez-passer; - the possibility for the parties to suspend the agreement in whole or in part for any reason deemed appropriate; - the amendment of the general clause of the agreement to ensure that: (i) the facilitation granted to Cabo Verdean citizens would be granted to EU citizens if the visa requirement for stays of up to 30 days re-imposed for their visit to Cabo Verde; (ii) at least the same facilitation are granted to EU citizens applying for a Cabo Verde visa for stays exceeding 30 days but not exceeding 90 days; - the amendment of the Joint Declaration on cooperation on travel documents to include a reference to Cabo Verde’s internal legislation introducing biometric travel documents."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: following the judgements of the Court of Justice in the so-called “Open Skies” cases, on 5 June 2003 the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with third countries on the replacement of certain provisions in existing bilateral air services agreements with an agreement at Union level (the “horizontal authorisation”). The objectives of such agreements are to give all EU air carriers non-discriminatory access to routes between the European Union and third countries, and hence to bring bilateral air services agreements between Member States and third countries in line with Union law. CONTENT: in accordance with the mechanisms and directives in the Annex to the ”horizontal authorisation”, the Commission has negotiated an Agreement with the Republic of Korea that replaces certain provisions in the existing bilateral air services agreements between Member States and the Republic of Korea. The objective of the Agreement is to bring bilateral air services agreements between 22 Member States and the Republic of Korea in line with Union law: - Article 2 of the Agreement replaces the traditional designation clauses with an EU designation clause, permitting all EU carriers to benefit from the right of establishment. - Article 4 safeguards the right of Member States under EU law to impose, on a non-discriminatory basis, taxes, levies, duties, fees or charges on fuel supplied in its territory for use in an aircraft of a designated air carrier of the Republic of Korea that operates between a point in the territory of that Member State and another point in the territory of that Member State or in the territory of another Member State. - Article 5 resolves potential conflicts with the competition rules of the Union. With this proposal for a Decision, the Council is invited to approve on behalf of the Union the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Korea on certain aspects of air services."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the aim of the new agreement and protocol will enable 12 EU vessels to make use of fishing opportunities in Greenland’s waters for eight species: cod, pelagic redfish, demersal redfish, Greenland halibut, northern prawn, grenadier, capelin and Atlantic mackerel. The agreement will be valid for four years renewable for a further two. Members considered that the new agreement and protocol needed to be negotiated to bring them closer into line with fishing opportunities and scientific advice, to increase flexibility regarding catches, to introduce a lower by-catch quota and establish a six-year validity period for the protocol. In general, both the agreement and the protocol will contribute to better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular to reinforce monitoring, control and surveillance. The agreement provides for financial compensation from the EU of EUR 16 521 754, of which EUR 2 931 000 is earmarked for support for and the development of Greenland’s fisheries sector. It was stressed in the explanatory statement that the negotiations on the agreement and protocol thereto were held in parallel with the negotiations on the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which delayed the conclusion of an agreement. It was also stressed that Brexit has destabilised relations with all North Atlantic countries and therefore particular attention needs to be paid to this state of affairs."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU faces a security landscape in flux, with evolving and increasingly complex security threats. Criminals and terrorists exploit the advantages that the digital transformation and new technologies bring about, including the inter-connectivity and blurring of the boundaries between the physical and digital world. The COVID-19 crisis has added to this, as criminals have quickly seized opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities. These threats spread across borders and manifest themselves in poly-criminal organised crime groups that engage in a wide range of criminal activities. As action at national level alone does not suffice to address these transnational security challenges, therefore the Commission proposes to enhance Europol’s mandate in order to give further support to Member States’ law enforcement authorities. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: this proposal aims to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ law enforcement services and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy. Specific provisions of the new mandate The new mandate should: - ensure effective cooperation between Europol and private parties: terrorists often abuse the services provided by private companies to recruit volunteers, to carry out terrorist attacks and to disseminate their propaganda. The revised mandate would allow private parties to refer such information directly to Europol. The Agency would be able to receive personal data directly from private parties and analyse it to identify all Member States concerned; request personal data from private parties (via the Member State where it is located); and act as a channel for Member States' requests to private parties, in compliance with data protection requirements; - enable Europol to exchange personal data with private parties related to crisis response: the proposal sets out rules for Europol to support Member States in preventing the large scale dissemination, via online platforms, of terrorist content related to on-going or recent real-world events depicting harm to life or physical integrity. Europol would be able to exchange personal data with private parties, including hashes, IP addresses or URLs related to such content; - allow Europol to analyse large datasets (‘big data') to support criminal investigations, considering that the processing of large data sets is an integral part of police work in today's digital world; - improve Europol's cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, including through analytical support to the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and information exchange, and with the European Anti-Fraud Office; - reinforce Europol's role in developing new technologies for law enforcement, helping to equip national law enforcement authorities with modern technologies to counter serious crime and terrorism; - strengthen Europol's data protection framework, accountability and democratic oversight, including by introducing new reporting obligations for Europol to the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group in charge of monitoring its activities. Budgetary implications The proposal would have an impact on the budget and staff needs of Europol. It is estimated that an additional budget of around EUR 180 million and around 160 additional posts would be needed for the overall MFF period to ensure that Europol has the necessary resources to enforce its revised mandate. This increase in staff and budget would give Europol the means to fulfil its strengthened mandate. It would provide the European Counter Terrorism Centre with adequate resources and to enable its EU Internet Referral Unit to monitor and refer all types of terrorist content to online platforms with a 24/7 availability. The revision of Europol's mandate also opens the possibility for Member States to contribute directly to Europol's budget, where necessary and required by existing or new tasks."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: given the increasingly global nature of serious crime and terrorism brought about by growing mobility, the information that third countries and international organisations obtain about criminals and terrorists is increasingly relevant for the EU‘s security. Such information should contribute to the comprehensive efforts to ensure internal security in the European Union. Some of this information is only shared with Europol. While Europol holds valuable information received from external partners on serious criminals and terrorists, it cannot issue alerts in SIS. Member States are also not always able to issue alerts in SIS on the basis of such information. In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on serious crime and terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters – where the monitoring of their movement is crucial – it is necessary to ensure Europol is able to make this information available directly and in real-time to front-line officers in Member States. Europol should therefore be authorised to enter alerts in SIS, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. To that end, the Commission proposes that a specific category of alert should be created in SIS, to be issued exclusively by Europol, in order to inform end-users carrying out a search in SIS that the person concerned is suspected of being involved in a criminal offence in respect of which Europol is competent, and in order for Europol to obtain confirmation that the person who is subject to the alert has been located. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: the present proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol. In particular, it widens the scope of application of the current SIS by introducing a new alert category for Europol. Specific provisions The proposal seeks to: - enable Europol to issue ‘information alerts’ on suspects and criminals as a new alert category in SIS, for exclusive use by Europol in specific and well-defined cases and circumstances. This is an important paradigm change for SIS, as until now, only Member States could enter, update and delete data in SIS and Europol had ‘read-only’ access covering all alert categories. Europol would be able to issue alerts on the basis of its analysis of third-country sourced information or information from international organisations, within the scope of crimes falling under Europol’s mandate and only on third-country nationals who are not beneficiaries of free movement rights. The purpose of the new alert category is that in case of a ‘hit’, the alert would inform the frontline officer that Europol holds information on the person; - set out detailed provisions on the procedural requirements that Europol is required to fulfil prior to entering an alert in SIS; - align the obligations and requirements of Europol when entering alerts in SIS with alert issuing Member States. These requirements concern: categories of data, proportionality, minimum data content for an alert to be entered, entering biometric data, general data processing rules, quality of the data in SIS as well as rules on distinguishing between persons with similar characteristics, misused identity and links. The frontline officer would be required to report immediately the occurrence of the ‘hit’ to the national SIRENE Bureau, which would in turn contact Europol. The frontline officer would only report that the person who is subject of an alert was located and would indicate the place, time and reason for the check carried out; - define the review period for alerts entered by Europol as well as the alert deletion rules which are specific to this type of alert. As a general rule, an alert should be kept only for the time that is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact, estimated at EUR 1 820 000 for the period 2021-2022, reflects the changes required for establishing this new alert category in Central SIS by eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the management and development of Central SIS. The expenses related to the development of the national systems connected to Central SIS are to be covered by the resources available to the Member States under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 for the development and maintenance of SIS. The proposal would also require Europol to set up a technical interface for entering, updating and deleting data in Central SIS."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament’s position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the Commission proposal as follows: Strengthen the Agency’s mission : the future Agency shall support, facilitate, coordinate and strengthen practical cooperation, information exchange and the implementation of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS), including fundamental rights compliance, by performing the following tasks: assist Member States on training or provide training to Member States' experts from all national administrations, courts and tribunals, and national services responsible for asylum matters: the main objective would be to promote best practice and the highest standards in the implementation of EU asylum legislation and to protect the needs of unaccompanied minors and vulnerable persons, integration and resettlement issues and other relevant asylum issues; assist Member States with a view to guaranteeing high standards and respect of fundamental rights; deploy liaison officers in Member States and, where appropriate, third countries; evaluate the implementation of the CEAS, as well as the asylum and reception systems and the reception capacity of the Member States; assist Member States with regard to humanitarian visas; carry out resettlement missions; support Member States with a view to the correct implementation of the Dublin system as regards determining the responsibility of Member States for asylum applications. Cooperation with other organisations : in order to perform its tasks, the Agency shall work in close cooperation with the UNHCR, relevant intergovernmental organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the International Organisation for Migration, and relevant non-governmental organisations, researchers and academics. It shall also close collaboration with the European Border and Coast Guard and shall take into account the risk analysis and vulnerability assessment carried out by that Agency to ensure the highest level of consistency and convergence in the information provided by both Agencies. All relevant information shall be sent to the European Parliament. Transparency, communication and cooperation : the Agency and the Member States' asylum authorities, national immigration and asylum services and other national services shall be subject to a duty to cooperate in good faith and an obligation to exchange all relevant information on a regular basis. Where the Executive Director has established that a Member State's asylum authorities, national immigration and asylum services and other national services have systematically failed to comply with the duty to cooperate in good faith, including the duty to provide timely and accurate information, he or she shall submit a report to the Management Board and to the Commission and include such information in the annual activity report on the situation of asylum in the Union. The Agency should focus on the following key issues: the processing of applications for international protection by national administrations and authorities, including on the duration of processing of applications and on other procedural aspects; the Agency shall study the differences in the recognition rates recorded by Member States regarding applications for international protection from applicants of a given country of origin which is the subject of the common analysis; the root causes, migratory and refugee flows, particularly on the presence of unaccompanied minors, reception capacity and resettlement needs, as well as on any sudden arrivals of large numbers of third-country nationals which may cause disproportionate pressure on asylum and reception systems, with a view to foster quick and reliable mutual information to the Member States and to identify possible risks to the Member States' asylum systems; issues regarding a common EU list of safe countries. The information relating to the drawing up of this list should be forwarded to the European Parliament. In this regard, it is provided that the Parliament, the Council or the Commission may request the Agency to examine the situation in one of the third countries in order to determine whether the conditions and criteria for inclusion on the safe list is still relevant; the assessment of the asylum situation in the Member States: to this end, the Agency will be able to carry out on-site (possibly unannounced) inspections and case sampling on the basis of information provided by the applicants and on the evaluations transmitted by the bodies and organisations with which it cooperates. Providing the Agency with new operational capacities : it is proposed to provide new operational capacities to the Agency in the field of human resources. In order to carry out its task of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the Common European Asylum System and the Member States’ asylum and reception systems in an effective, impartial and independent manner, the Agency shall have an appropriate number of permanent and temporary staff and adequate financial resources. The task of monitoring and evaluating the CEAS should not be carried out by seconded experts, but by the Agency’s own staff, trained for that purpose. Each Member State shall contribute to the number of experts, in accordance with Annex 1a. Member States who do not make available the required number of experts shall instead provide a financial contribution to a platform set up at Union level, contributing to addressing challenges due to disproportionate pressure and managed directly or indirectly by the Agency. The Agency shall inform the European Parliament on an annual basis of the number of experts that each Member State has committed and the number experts actually deployed from the pool. Provision of reception facilities : for the purposes of organising and coordinating the operational and technical measures, the Agency may enter into emergency standby agreements with the UNHCR and relevant intergovernmental or non-governmental organisations to complement the Agency’s capacity to provide operational and technical assistance to Member States, in particular with regard to the setting up or provision of reception facilities, the provision of information to asylum seekers, identification, referral and assistance to vulnerable persons and the provision of interpretation services. Deployment of migration management support teams : where a Member State faces disproportionate migratory challenges at particular hotspot areas of its external borders characterised by large inward mixed migratory flows, that Member State may request technical and operational reinforcement by migration management support teams. The Member State shall submit a request for reinforcement and an assessment of its needs to the Agency and other relevant Union agencies, in particular the European Border and Coast Guard and Europol. The Executive Director, in coordination with other relevant Union agencies, shall assess a Member State's request for reinforcement and the assessment of its needs for the purpose of defining a comprehensive reinforcement package consisting of various activities coordinated by the relevant Union agencies to be agreed upon by the Member State concerned. During deployment of asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool, the host Member State shall issue instructions to the teams in accordance with the operational plan. It is also provided that the Agency deploy liaison officers in Member States and, where appropriate, third countries. The tasks of the Agency's liaison officers shall include, in compliance with Union law and in full respect of fundamental rights, establishing and maintaining contacts with the competent authorities of the third country to which they are assigned. The decision to deploy liaison officers to third countries shall be subject to receiving the prior opinion of the Commission. The European Parliament shall be kept fully informed of those activities without delay. It should be noted that where experts of an asylum support team or from the asylum intervention pool are operating in a third country, the Agency shall be liable for any damage caused by them during their activities. Evaluations carried out by the Agency : it is proposed that Member States shall be monitored every three years (and not five as proposed by the Commission) in particular on all aspects of the CEAS. This can also be seen as a preventive measure, since deficiencies may be detected and rectified in a timely matter. The result of these assessments would also provide a clear picture on the overall functioning of CEAS. Besides this general assessment, it is proposed that there is a need for the possibility of an assessment/monitoring to be decided on an annual basis. Such assessment is to be linked with the information analysis prepared by the Agency. The annual assessment could be carried out in one or more Member States, depending on the abovementioned information analysis carried out by the Agency. Implementation by Member States of the CEAS and liaison officers in Member States : it is proposed that the Agency initiate a monitoring exercise which would only be carried out in specific cases, where events in any of the Member States give rise to serious concerns regarding the functioning of any aspects of that Member States’ asylum system and may put the functioning of the CEAS in jeopardy if not handled in a timely manner. The Agency may decide that a liaison officer covers up to four Member States which are geographically close to each other. A cooperation procedure between the Agency, liaison officers and the Member States is proposed in this regard. Following the Agency’s remarks, the Commission may take measures to address the serious shortcomings observed and inform the European Parliament thereof. Fundamental Rights : Members proposed appointing a fundamental rights officer responsible for drawing up the fundamental rights strategy, monitoring compliance with fundamental rights and promoting the respect of fundamental rights by the Agency. The officer shall be independent in the performance of his or her duties, and shall have access to all information concerning respect for fundamental rights, including by carrying out on-site visits to any operational activity carried out by the Agency. The budget, including the establishment plan, shall include sufficient financing of the Fundamental Rights Strategy and the Fundamental Rights Officer amounting to at least 5 % of the overall budget. The Agency shall draw up and further develop and implement a fundamental rights strategy including an effective mechanism to monitor the respect for fundamental rights in all the activities of the Agency. Various provisions : it is proposed to establish: a code of conduct applicable to all experts involved in support operations laying down provisions to guarantee the principles of the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights with particular focus on children, and other persons in a vulnerable situation; a compliant mechanism to monitor and ensure the respect for fundamental rights in all the activities of the Agency; a prevention of conflicts of interest mechanism requiring the members of its bodies and its staff members to avoid any situation liable to give rise to a conflict of interest during their employment or term of office and to report such situations."

Following the recommendation of the Committee on International Trade, Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As a reminder, the EU formally launched the negotiation process (under Article XXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994) with several WTO members in Geneva in October 2018. The negotiations are based on a ‘joint approach’ developed in 2017 by the EU and the UK on how to allocate the quantitative commitments contained in the EU-28's WTO schedule for the EU's 143 WTO tariff-rate quotas for agricultural, fisheries and industrial products. The principle of the applied methodology is based on the trade flows in the EU-27 and the UK over a representative reference period (of three years between 2013 and 2015) for all WTO tariff-rate quotas. The agreed methodology of the apportionment is described in detail in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. On 15 June 2018, the Council authorised the Commission to launch negotiations under Article XXVIII GATT with the relevant WTO Members, including Australia, with a view to apportioning the Union's WTO concessions on tariff-rate quotas. Australia has negotiating rights for 14 tariff quotas and consultation rights for 6 tariff quotas. Negotiations with Australia resulted in an agreement that was initialled on 18 December 2020 in Geneva."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2015/848 is an important instrument for judicial cooperation in civil matters at EU level. It contains a comprehensive set of rules directly applicable to cross-border insolvency proceedings which are referred to in Annex A and to types of insolvency practitioners referred to in Annex B. These two annexes list exhaustively, respectively, the insolvency proceedings and the insolvency practitioners provided for in the laws of the Member States and to which the Regulation applies. It is therefore important that these annexes are regularly updated to take account of the current legal situation in the Member States. In October 2020, the Netherlands notified the Commission of recent changes to its national insolvency legislation, introducing a new preventive insolvency regime and new categories of insolvency practitioners. Notifications were subsequently received from Italy, Lithuania, Cyprus and Poland in December 2020. The Commission has analysed the notifications from these Member States carefully to ensure that they meet the requirements of the Regulation. CONTENT: the Commission proposal replaces the lists in Annexes A and B of Regulation (EU) 2015/848 with new lists that take into account the information notified by the Netherlands, Italy, Lithuania, Cyprus and Poland. It merely amends these annexes to accurately reflect the content of the national notifications and to adapt the annexes listing the respective national procedures or categories of insolvency practitioners in this area."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2018/1091 on integrated farm statistics requires Member States to carry out integrated farm surveys in 2020, 2023 and 2026. The Regulation contains a provision on the establishment of the budget for the collection of data for the surveys to be carried out in 2023 and 2026. It establishes the financial envelope for the entire duration of the relevant multiannual financial framework (MFF). In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1091, the amount of the Union contribution to integrated farm statistics under the MFF 2021-2027 should be fixed by the European Parliament and the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, once the MFF 2021-2027 has entered into force. The proposal is part of the strategy for agricultural statistics for 2020 and beyond, a major programme to modernise EU agricultural statistics produced by the European Commission in close cooperation with the Member States. It aims to ensure the quality and comparability of European agricultural statistics collected and compiled according to the same principles in all Member States. CONTENT: this proposal concerns the financing of integrated statistics on agricultural holdings for the period 2021-2027. It establishes a budget of EUR 40 million for the period 2021-2027 (of which EUR 36.4 million is for grants to national statistical institutes and other national authorities). The amount proposed for 2021-2027 should finance the farm structure surveys conducted in 2023 and 2026 only, including the costs related to the management, maintenance and development of the databases used by the Commission to process the data supplied by Member States. The EU's financial contribution for the grants should be provided by the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 enables retail investors to better understand and compare packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (PRIIPs) and make better-informed investment decisions. To meet its objectives, Regulation requires PRIIPs manufacturers to comply with a uniform set of product disclosure requirements and provide retail investors with a key information document (KID) on each PRIIP they offer. Article 32 of Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a KID. This arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 supplements Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 by laying down regulatory technical standards with regard to the presentation, content and standard format of the key information document. The Commission adopted Commission Delegated Regulation amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653 to make it easier for management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS. However, the date of application of Delegated Regulation has been set on 1 July 2022 to give those management companies, investment companies, and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and thus for the obligation to draw up a key information document. This proposal is accompanied by a proposal amending Directive 2009/65/EC as regards the use of key information documents by management companies of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS). CONTENT: the Commission proposes to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders sufficient time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and implement the other proposed measure (which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653). Under this proposal, Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 would apply to management companies, investment companies and persons advising on or selling units of UCITS and non-UCITS on the same date as the amendments to Directive 2009/65/EC and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653, i.e. from 1 July 2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: according to Directive 2009/65/EC, each undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) must provide ‘key investor information’ to help investors understand the essential characteristics of the UCITS and make informed investment decisions. Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 provides for a transitional arrangement whereby management companies, investment companies and persons advising on, or selling, units of UCITS and non-UCITS are temporarily exempted from the requirement to provide retail investors with a key information document. The arrangement currently applies until 31 December 2021. The Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation to extend the transitional arrangement provided for in Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 until 30 June 2022. This will give stakeholders time to prepare for the end of the transitional arrangement and to implement the other proposed measure [which provides for amendments to Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/653] from 1 July 2022. As things stand, as of 1 July 2022 retail investors in UCITS would receive both a key information document in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 and key investor information in accordance with Directive 2009/65/EC. It is desirable to avoid a situation where retail investors receive two different pre-contractual disclosure documents in respect of the same UCITS. The proposed measures are necessary to reduce the consequences of parallel application of Directive 2009/65/EC and Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014. CONTENT: this proposal inserts a new article in Directive 2009/65/EC which lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner that, where a key information document is drawn up, provided, revised and translated for a UCITS pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014, it should be considered as satisfying the requirements applicable to key investor information for the purposes of that Directive."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: adequate minimum wages are a fundamental component of the European model of social market economy. When set at adequate levels, minimum wages protect the income of disadvantaged workers, help ensure a decent living, and limit the fall in income during bad times. During economic recessions, such as the COVID-19 crisis, the role of minimum wages in protecting low-wage workers is essential to support a sustainable and inclusive economic recovery. Principle 6 of the Pillar on ‘Wages’ calls for adequate minimum wages as well as for transparent and predictable wage setting to be put in place, according to national practices and respecting the autonomy of the social partners. Minimum wage protection can be provided by collective agreements (as is the case in six Member States) or by statutory minimum wages set by law (as is the case in 21 Member States). However, many workers are currently not protected by adequate minimum wages in the EU. In the majority of Member States with national statutory minimum wages, minimum wages are too low vis-à-vis other wages or to provide a decent living, even if they have increased in recent years. National statutory minimum wages are lower than 60% of the gross median wage and/or 50% of the gross average wage in almost all Member States. In 2018, the statutory minimum wage did not provide sufficient income for a single minimum-wage earner to reach the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in nine Member States. In this context, the proposed directive aims to ensure that EU workers are protected by adequate minimum wages allowing for a decent living wherever they work. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the quantitative analysis carried out on a scenario based on a hypothetical increase of minimum wages to 60% of the gross median wage shows that it would improve the adequacy of minimum wages in about half of the Member States. Between 10 and 20 million workers would benefit from these improvements. In several countries, improvements in minimum wage protection would result in a reduction of in-work poverty and wage inequality by over 10% and a reduction in the gender pay gap by about 5% or more. CONTENT: the proposed directive establishes minimum requirements at EU level to ensure both that minimum wages are set at an adequate level and that workers can have access to the protection offered by minimum wages, either in the form of a statutory minimum wage or in the form of wages set by collective agreements. The proposal respects Member States’ competence to set higher standards, without prejudice to the role that Member States may entrust to social partners, in accordance with national traditions and in full respect of social partners’ contractual freedom. The proposed Directive: - would apply to workers with an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by law, collective agreements or practice in each Member State, including workers in atypical forms of employment ; - would oblige Member States to take measures to promote the capacity of the social partners to engage in collective bargaining on wages to encourage wage bargaining. In the case of countries where there is a legal minimum wage, the proposal: - requires Member States to provide for national criteria for setting and updating statutory minimum wages that are defined in a stable and clear manner, regular and timely updates and the establishment of consultative bodies; - calls on the Member States, in consultation with the social partners to: (i) limit the use of variations in minimum wages and their application over time and their extent and (ii) provide for the protection of statutory minimum wages against unjustified or disproportionate deductions; - requires effective and timely participation of the social partners in the setting and updating of statutory minimum wages, including through participation in consultative bodies; - Requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that workers have effective access to the protection offered by statutory minimum wages (e.g. strengthening the system of controls and field inspections, informing workers about applicable statutory minimum wages). With a view to monitoring the implementation of this Directive, the Commission should report to the European Parliament and the Council its assessment of developments in the adequacy and coverage of minimum wages on the basis of the information provided by Member States."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU, the Union and the UK notified the other Members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that their current market access level will be maintained but apportioned respectively between the Union and the United Kingdom. The methodology for this apportionment, as well as the new EU-27 volumes, are laid down in Regulation (EU) 2019/216 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Paraguay has a tariff rate quota of 1 000 tonnes for high quality bovine meat (order number 094455), which is not included in the EU’s WTO schedule. This tariff rate quotas was erroneously included in the apportionment exercise and thus reduced to 711 tonnes on the EU-27 side without any corresponding volume being opened on the UK side. This means Paraguay’s market access has been reduced from 1 000 tonnes to 711 tonnes with application as of 1 January 2021. It is therefore appropriate to restore this tariff quota to its original volume. This initiative is in line with the EU’s ongoing actions to ensure that the consequences of the withdrawal of the UK from the EU are dealt with in an orderly manner. CONTENT: the Commission proposes to amend Regulation (EU) 2019/216 in order to restore the correct volume (1000 tonnes) of tariff quota No 094455 for EU-27. The row relating to order number 094455 (High quality meat of bovine animals, fresh, chilled or frozen from Paraguay) would thus be deleted from the Annex, Part A of Regulation (EU) 2019/216."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the Council and the representatives of the Governments of the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council. BACKGROUND: the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement represented a significant change in transatlantic aviation relations, providing broad new commercial freedoms for airlines and a comprehensive framework for regulatory cooperation with the United States on a wide range of issues. The 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement created substantial benefits for airlines, airports and air transport users in Europe. However, the EU was seeking additional investment and market access opportunities. Therefore, Article 21 of the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement established a non-exhaustive list of 'items of priority interest' for the second stage negotiations, including additional investment and market access opportunities, as well as environmental issues. After eight rounds of second stage negotiations, agreement was reached on 25 March 2010 on a draft Protocol to Amend the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement. The Protocol aims at: launching a process towards additional foreign investment opportunities in the airline industry, further opening market access, including further access by EU airlines to US Government-financed air transportation, and further strengthening the regulatory cooperation in all fields of aviation policy, particularly on addressing the environmental impact of aviation. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: the Protocol further increases the benefits for consumers, airlines, labour, and communities in the Union: (1) in a study carried out for the Commission, the economic benefits of a fully Open Aviation Area between the EU and the United States have been estimated at several billion Euros per year; (2) another study estimates that further regulatory convergence in the field of air transport could significantly reduce costs for the industry. The same study concluded that the second stage negotiations have the potential to change the structure of the market in the EU and in the US, increasing profitability in the airline industry; (3) the inclusion of an article on the social dimension ensures that the further market opening will be accompanied by high labour standards and that labour-related rights will not be undermined by the new opportunities created by the Protocol; (4) lastly, the Protocol includes firm commitments from both Parties to limit or reduce the impact of international aviation on the environment. LEGAL BASE: Article 207(5), in conjunction with Article 218 paragraphs (2) and (5), as well Article 218(6)(a)(v) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States for the following reasons: (i) an amendment of an international treaty at Union level can only be done at Union level; (ii) the objectives of the Protocol can only be achieved at Union level because they involve a number of areas of exclusive Union competence. CONTENT: the Protocol amends the 2007 EU-US Air Transport Agreement with the following provisions: a legal obligation to reciprocally recognise the regulatory determinations of the other Party with regard to airline fitness and citizenship; an enhanced cooperation to limit the impact of international aviation on the environment. The cooperation on addressing the environmental impacts of international aviation will include the areas of research and development, air traffic management innovation, coordination in international fora; an explicit recognition of the importance of the social dimension and the benefits of high labour standards as well as an enhanced cooperation on the social effects of the agreement; a strengthened role of the Joint Committee, enabling it to address incompatible regulatory approaches, allow for reciprocal recognition of decision-making, and promote cooperation across a number of additional fields, including air traffic management, facilitation, safety and cooperation with other countries; a process towards further market access and investment opportunities. Both sides commit to continuing to remove market access barriers. The Joint Committee will regularly review progress in that respect. Both sides will establish a process of cooperation in the Joint Committee towards the shared goal of removing market access barriers; further access of EU airlines to air transport funded by the US Government that is restricted currently to US airlines (""Fly America""). EU airlines will be able to sell air transportation to contractors of the US Government on any route, with exception of transport financed by the US Department of Defence. The Protocol is accompanied by a Memorandum of Consultations that includes additional new elements, in order to further enhance the existing cooperation in the areas of aviation security, competition policy, and the joint efforts to address the environmental impact of international aviation. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: the proposal has no implication for the Union’s budget."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Gabon and the European Community was signed on 4 June 2007 and entered into force on 11 June 2007 for a period of six years. The agreement is renewable by tacit agreement and is still in force. A previous three-year protocol implementing the JPA entered into force on 24 July 2013 and expired on 23 July 2016. In 2015, the Commission carried out an ex-post evaluation of the 2013-2016 JPA protocol, as well as an ex-ante evaluation of a possible renewal of the protocol. The evaluation concluded that the EU fishing sector has a strong interest in operating in Gabon and that a renewal of the protocol would be in the interest of both parties. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Gabon with a view to concluding, on behalf of the EU, a new protocol for the implementation of the FPA (2021-2026). Following these negotiations, a protocol was initialled by the negotiators on 10 February 2021. The new protocol covers a period of five years from the date of its signature by both parties. The negotiation of a new protocol for the implementation of the sustainable fisheries partnership agreement with Gabon is part of the Union's external action towards the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, and takes particular account of the Union's objectives regarding respect for democratic principles and human rights. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve the protocol for the implementation (2021-2026) of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the Gabonese Republic and the European Community. Objectives The conclusion of the implementing protocol will allow the strategic partnership in the field of fisheries between the European Union and Gabon to be continued and strengthened. The conclusion of the protocol will create fishing opportunities for EU vessels in the Gabonese fishing zone. The agreement and the protocol will also contribute to: - better management and conservation of fisheries resources, through financial support (sectoral support) for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the global plan for fisheries, the monitoring of and fight against illegal fishing, and support for the artisanal fisheries sector; - Gabon's sustainable exploitation of its marine resources and Gabon's fisheries economy by promoting growth in fisheries-related economic activities and the establishment of decent working conditions. Fishing opportunities The new protocol provides for fishing opportunities in the following categories: - 27 purse seine tuna vessels; - 6 pole-and-line tuna vessels; - support vessels in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) and the limits set by Gabonese legislation; - 4 trawlers targeting demersal fish and crustaceans to be authorised according to the results of exploratory campaigns. Financial contribution The annual financial contribution amounts to EUR 2 600 000, based on: (a) an annual amount of EUR 1 600 000 for access to fisheries resources in the Gabonese fishing zone, equivalent to a reference tonnage for highly migratory species of 32 000 tonnes per year; (b) support for the development of Gabon's sectoral fisheries policy amounting to EUR 1 000 000 per year. This support is in line with the objectives of the strategic plan for fisheries in Gabon. The annual amount for commitment and payment appropriations will be established during the annual budget procedure."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a sharp drop in rail traffic, because of a significant fall in demand. This has had a serious impact on railway undertakings. Those circumstances are beyond the control of railway undertakings that have continuously faced considerable liquidity problems, major losses and in some cases are risking insolvency. In order to counteract the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and support railway undertakings, Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 of the European Parliament and of the Council enabled Member States to authorise infrastructure managers to reduce, waive or defer charges for accessing rail infrastructure. That possibility was granted for a reference period from 1 March 2020 until 31 December 2020 and was further extended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1061 until 31 December 2021. The Commission is no longer empowered to extend further that reference period. However, the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing therefore the reference period of Regulation (EU) 2020/1429 should be extended until 30 June 2022 to ensure continuity in the application of the measures. CONTENT: the Commission proposal aims to extend the reference period until 30 June 2022, and to empower the Commission to adopt delegated acts to further extend such period until 31 December 2023. It is also proposed that the delegation of power should end on the same date, that is, 31 December 2023. All other provisions of the current Regulation should remain unchanged. The Commission should continuously analyse the economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the rail sector and the Union should be in a position to prolong without undue delay the period of application of the measures provided for by this Regulation if the adverse conditions persist. In order to allow for the prompt application of the measures provided for in this Regulation, it should enter into force as a matter of urgency on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: EU-Ukraine relations continue to develop within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Eastern Partnership. An Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine, providing for a deep and comprehensive free trade area, entered into force on 1 September 2017. Since spring 2014, Ukraine has been carrying out an ambitious reform programme aimed at stabilising its economy and improving the living conditions of its population. The fight against corruption as well as constitutional, electoral and judicial reforms are among the main priorities. The implementation of these reforms has been supported by five consecutive macro-financial assistance programmes, under which Ukraine has received loans totalling EUR 5 billion over the period 2014-2021. In order to allow for greater policy flexibility in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved an 18-month Stand-By Arrangement with Ukraine in June 2020 for an amount equivalent to USD 5 billion. The Ukrainian economy has been affected by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the persistent security threats on the country's border with Russia. Inflation accelerated and reached 10% by the end of 2021. The worsening geopolitical tensions on Ukraine's border with Russia have had a profound impact on confidence, particularly among foreign investors. According to the latest IMF projections, the lack of access to capital markets is expected to widen the country's funding gap by at least USD 2.5 billion in 2022 and significantly increase risks to the country's macroeconomic outlook. It is against this background of increased geopolitical uncertainty, which prevents Ukraine from accessing international capital markets and affects its economic situation, that the Commission is presenting a proposal to provide Ukraine with new MFA in the form of loans to foster stability in the country. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the EU makes available to Ukraine macro-financial assistance (MFA) of up to EUR 1.2 billion with a view to facilitating macroeconomic stabilisation and the implementation of a comprehensive reform programme. The planned emergency MFA, put forward to provide swift support in a situation of acute crisis and to strengthen the resilience of the country, will have a duration of 12 months and include two disbursements: - the release of the first tranche, subject to the political precondition and a satisfactory implementation of the IMF programme, would occur swiftly after the approval of this proposal, upon entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on specific structural policy measures, agreed between the European Commission on behalf of the EU and Ukraine; - the disbursement of the second tranche would be linked to the continuous satisfactory implementation of both an IMF programme and the policy measures agreed in the MoU. The MoU underpinning this emergency macro-financial assistance operation is likely to focus on a limited number of feasible, short-term policy actions in the most urgent priority areas, such as strengthening economic resilience and stability, governance and rule of law, and energy. The implementation of the proposed operation is expected to go hand-in-hand with the support under budgetary operations financed by the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI). The announced additional allocation of EUR 120 million in NDICI grants will be important to further strengthen Ukraine’s state-building and resilience efforts. A pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance shall be that Ukraine respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. In addition, the specific objectives of the Union's macro-financial assistance should strengthen the efficiency, transparency and accountability of the public finance management systems and promote structural reforms aimed at supporting sustainable and inclusive growth, decent employment creation and fiscal consolidation. Both the fulfilment of the preconditions and the achievement of those objectives should be regularly monitored by the Commission and the European External Action Service. In order for the European Parliament and the Council to follow the implementation of this decision, the Commission will have to inform them regularly on developments related to the assistance. Budgetary implications The proposed macro-financial assistance operation in favour of Ukraine would be disbursed in two equal instalments, to be disbursed over 12 months. These funds will be borrowed on the capital market and then lent to Ukraine. The loan will benefit from the external action guarantee. The required provisioning (corresponding to 9% of the loan amount) will be provided under the Neighbourhood, Development Cooperation and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 108 million."

The committee recommended that the European Parliament give its consent to the draft Council decision. The Convention on the Conservation and Management of High Seas Fishery Resources in the North Pacific Ocean was signed on 24 February 2012 and entered into force on 19 July 2015. Its aim is to ensure the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fishery resources in the Convention Area while protecting the North Pacific marine ecosystems in which those resources occur. By acceding to the Convention, the Union intends to give the Member States and Union vessels concerned access to the fishery resources in the Convention area. Accession to the North Pacific Ocean Convention creates new opportunities for EU vessels. It would promote consistency in the EU's approach to conservation across the world’s oceans and reinforce its commitment to the long-term conservation and sustainable use of fisheries resources globally. With a view to reaching its objectives, the Convention provides for the following actions to be taken: - promoting the optimum utilization and ensuring the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources; - adopting measures, based on the best scientific information available, to ensure that fisheries resources are maintained at or restored to levels capable of producing maximum sustainable yield; - adopting and implementing measures in accordance with the precautionary approach and an ecosystem approach to fisheries, and in accordance with the relevant rules of international law; - assessing the impacts of fishing activities on species belonging to the same ecosystem or dependent upon or associated with the target stocks and adopting, where necessary, conservation and management measures for such species; - protecting biodiversity in the marine environment; - preventing or eliminating overfishing and excess fishing capacity; - ensuring that complete and accurate data concerning fishing activities are collected and shared in a timely and appropriate manner; - ensuring that any expansion of fishing effort, development of new or exploratory fisheries, or change in the gear used for existing fisheries, does not proceed without prior assessment of the impacts of those fishing activities on the long-term sustainability of fisheries resources; - ensuring compliance with conservation and management measures and that sanctions applicable in respect of violations are adequate in severity to be effective in securing compliance, to discourage violations wherever they occur and to deprive offenders of the benefits accruing from their illegal activities; - minimising pollution and waste originating from fishing vessels, discards, catch by lost or abandoned gear, and impacts on other species and marine ecosystems."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Eurostat has been compiling European agricultural statistics on agriculture in the European Union for decades. These data collections were evaluated in 2016 and it was found that they needed to be updated to take account of changes in agriculture, the CAP and other related EU policies. The strategy for agricultural statistics to 2020 and beyond is a major programme for the modernisation of EU agricultural statistics run by the European Commission in close cooperation with Member States. The proposed changes are based on the following findings: - Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council sets up the economic accounts for agriculture (EAA) in the EU by providing for the methodology and time limits for the transmission of agricultural accounts. The regional economic accounts for agriculture (REAA) are a regional adaptation of the EAA. In addition to national figures, regional data help to better understand the diversity that exists between regions and complement the information for the EU, the euro area and individual Member States; - as statistics play a central role in the decision-making process, evidence-based decision-making requires high quality statistics. Quality reports are essential for assessing, improving and communicating the quality of European statistics; - lastly, the EAA provide important annual macroeconomic data to European policy-makers three times a year. The first and second estimates are followed by the final data. The current transmission deadline for the EAA second estimates does not provide much time after the end of the first reference period to collect improved data compared to the data provided for the first EAA estimates. CONTENT: the proposal for the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 aims to: - integrate the regional economic accounts for agriculture (REAA) into Regulation (EC) No 138/2004 as regards both the methodology and the appropriate deadlines for data transmission; - allow possible derogations from the regional economic accounts for agriculture (REAA) requirements; - add an article to cover quality reporting requirements; - confer implementing powers on the Commission as regards the arrangements for and the content of the quality reports; - relax the transmission deadlines for the second EAA estimates in order to facilitate improved data quality."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Russia’s recent military aggression against Ukraine and the ongoing armed conflict has fundamentally changed the security situation in Europe. As a result of the aggression, the European Union, and its eastern regions in particular, is facing a substantial inflow of persons. Secondly, the COVID-19 pandemic has lasted longer than could have been expected in 2020. The direct and indirect effects of the pandemic persist in all Member States, requiring prolonged public support for recovery in the most affected territories and economic sectors. This has put considerable pressure on Member States' budgets. While the flexibility and additional resources provided for the period 2014-2020 have helped Member States in their crisis response and recovery efforts, the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus, notably the Omicron variant, as well as the general tightening of restrictions in the last quarter of 2021, have continued to have serious negative effects on Member States’ economies and societies and hampered a normal implementation of cohesion policy programmes and of programmes supported by the FEAD. The recent military aggression by Russia and the resulting migration flows have exacerbated these effects and risk further undermining economic recovery. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. CONTENT: the proposal aims to: - facilitate the use of cohesion policy and FEAD resources by Member States and regions to support measures to address migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by Russia; and - allow for a derogation from the normal co-financing rules currently applicable in order to allow for the necessary flexibility to mobilise existing investment resources to address the direct and indirect effects stemming from the unprecedented public health crisis in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, it is proposed to amend Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 in order to: - ensure that Member States and regions may continue to benefit from a 100% EU co-financing rate for the accounting year 2021-2022 and this by way of notification to the Commission; - introduce arrangements for the budgetary execution of additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate to take account of annual ceilings for payments; - introduce additional flexibility between ERDF and ESF specifically for operations addressing the migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by Russia and introduce simplified reporting arrangements on participants with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 February 2022 (date of the start of the military aggression); - introduce flexibility for Member States to amend programmes supported by the FEAD and this by way of notification to the Commission and also with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 February 2022. Budgetary implications The proposed modification does not require changes in the Multiannual Financial Framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments and does not imply changes to the overall payment needs over the 2021-2027 period. Based on the previous uptake of the 100% co-financing rate in the 2020-2021 accounting year, the level of payment applications submitted in the second half of 2021, and the latest Member State payment forecasts for 2022, the budgetary impact of the application of the 100% co-financing rate for the 2021-2022 accounting year is estimated to represent a frontloading of payment needs of EUR 9 billion to 2022 and EUR 1 billion to 2023, compensated by a corresponding reduction of EUR 10 billion in 2024. However, in order to be able to comply with the payment ceilings in years 2022 and 2023, it is proposed to cap the total additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate at EUR 5 billion in 2022 and EUR 1 billion in 2023. The additional amounts will only be paid after all the payment applications are received for the accounting year 2021-2022."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Russia's invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022 has led to a massive influx of displaced persons from Ukraine into several Member States. This places renewed pressure on the financial resources of Member States to deal with urgent migration, border management and security needs. Taking into account the nature and dimension of the crisis, these unforeseen needs will persist beyond 2022. This invasion has given rise to increased needs in areas, such as migration and border management, directly covered by the Home Affairs Funds (2014-2020). The Commission considers it necessary to widen the scope of use of Home Affairs Funds as much as possible, by extending the period of eligibility and by unblocking access to unspent earmarked resources, thus avoiding the loss of unused funding following decommitment. This overall flexibility is necessary to ensure a comprehensive approach to migration management, based on mutual trust, solidarity and shared responsibility between Member States and EU institutions. CONTENT: the proposal aims to support Member States to address the consequences of the war in Ukraine, by facilitating access to unspent financial resources for the 2014-2020 programming period under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and the Internal Security Fund insofar as it concerns the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, 2 as well as the Internal Security Fund insofar as it concerns the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. Specifically, the proposal aims to: - extend the implementation period of the Home Affairs Funds 2014-2020 by one year. This extension will enable Member States to urgently utilise remaining funds to help address the increased pressure on their border and migration management systems arising from the invasion in Ukraine; - unlock access to unspent earmarked resources under the AMIF 2014-2020 to enable Member States to better address the increased pressure on their asylum and migration management systems stemming from the invasion of Ukraine. This access will be provided by amending Regulation (EU) 516/2014 establishing the AMIF and laying down provisions for its use; - enable the use of External Assigned Revenue under the AMIF 2021-2027. The proposed amendment to Regulation (EU) 2021/1147 aims to give Member States and other public or private donors the possibility, under the 2021-2027 programming period, to make additional financial contributions to asylum and migration management in the form of external assigned revenue. This external assigned revenue will constitute a dedicated contribution from Member States and other public or private donors to finance specific items of expenditure under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund for 2021-2027."

Parliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the agreement. As of 11 March 2022, over 310 000 refugees had entered the Republic of Moldova from Ukraine following the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. In just the first two weeks of the war, more than two million refugees – around 4% of Ukraine’s population – mainly fled westward from the encroaching Russian forces. Moldovan border management authorities are thus now facing the twin challenges of regulating the influx and subsequent outflow of potentially hundreds of thousands of refugees, including monitoring the smuggling of weapons. Furthermore, some 12% of the territory of the country is not under the control of Moldovan authorities, including a large portion of Moldova’s border with Ukraine. On 14 March 2022, the Council adopted a decision authorising the opening of negotiations on an agreement between the European Union and Moldova as regards actions by the European Border and Coast Guard Agency on the territory of Moldova. On 17 March 2021, on the basis of a written procedure, delegations confirmed their agreement on the proposal for a Council Decision on the signature of the Status Agreement with Moldova. The Agreement was signed the same day, subject to its conclusion at a later date. The aim of the agreement is to allow the European Border and Coast Guard Agency to deploy border management teams from the permanent contingent to Moldova. The agreement regulates all aspects necessary for the deployment of the Border Management Teams from the European Border and Coast Guard Standing Corps in the Republic of Moldova, where the members of the teams may exercise executive powers. A status agreement will allow Frontex to assist Moldova in border management, by deploying teams capable of assisting the Moldovan authorities in tasks such as registration and border checks."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal is part of the Digital Finance package, a package of measures to further enable and support the potential of digital finance in terms of innovation and competition while mitigating the risks. The digital finance package includes a new Strategy on digital finance for the EU financial sector with the aim to ensure that the Union’s financial services legislation is fit for the digital age, and contributes to a future-ready economy that works for the people, including by enabling the use of innovative technologies. The Union has a stated and confirmed policy interest in developing and promoting the uptake of transformative technologies in the financial sector, including blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT). This package also includes a proposal for a proposal on crypto-asset markets, a proposal for digital operational resilience, and a proposal to clarify or amend certain related EU financial services rules. CONTENT: the Commission seeks to propose a pilot regime for market infrastructures that wish to try to trade and settle transactions in financial instruments in crypto-asset form. The regime follows the ‘sandbox’ approach which allows for temporary derogations from some specific requirements under the Union financial services legislation that could otherwise prevent them from developing solutions for the trading and settlement of transactions in crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments. This proposed Regulation on a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology seeks to provide legal certainty and flexibility for market participants who wish to operate a DLT market infrastructure by establishing uniform requirements for operating these. Permissions granted under this Regulation shall allow market participants to operate a DLT market infrastructure and to provide their services across all Member States. Scope The proposal establishes operating conditions for DLT market infrastructures, permission to make use of them and the supervision and cooperation of competent authorities and ESMA. It shall apply to market participants (either investment firms, market operators or central securities depositories, CSDs). Limitations on the transferable securities admitted to trading on or settled by a DLT market infrastructure The proposal sets out the limitations in terms of DLT transferable securities that can be admitted to trading on, or recorded by, DLT market infrastructures. For shares, the market capitalisation or the tentative market capitalisation of the issuer of DLT transferable securities should be less than EUR 200 million; for public bonds other than sovereign bonds, covered bonds and corporate bonds the limit is EUR 500 million. DLT market infrastructures shall not admit to trading or record sovereign bonds. In addition, the total market value of DLT transferable securities recorded by a CSD operating a DLT securities settlement system, or by a DLT MTF where allowed to record such DLT transferable securities, shall not exceed EUR 2.5 billion. Additional requirements on DLT market infrastructures Additional requirements are laid down to address the novel forms of risks raised using DLT. DLT market infrastructures must provide all members, participants, clients and investors with clear and unambiguous information on how they carry out their functions, services and activities. DLT market infrastructures must also ensure that overall IT and cyber arrangements related to the use of DLT are adequate. Where the business model of a DLT market infrastructure involves the safekeeping of clients’ funds or DLT transferable securities, or the means to access these, they must have adequate arrangements to safeguard such assets. Cooperation between operators of DLT market infrastructures, competent authorities and ESMA It is proposed that DLT market infrastructures must inform competent authorities and ESMA of, for example: proposed material changes to their business plan including critical staff, evidence of hacking, fraud or other serious malpractice, material changes in the information contained in the initial application, technical or operational difficulties in delivering activities or services covered under the permission and any risks to investor protection, market integrity or financial stability that may have arisen and were not foreseen at the time the permission was given. Where notified of such information, the competent authority may request the DLT market infrastructure to submit an application for another permission, exemption or take any corrective measure it deems appropriate. In addition, the DLT market infrastructure shall produce and submit a report to the competent authority and ESMA detailing all of the information above including potential difficulties in applying EU financial services legislation. Reporting At the latest after a five-year period, ESMA shall produce a detailed report on the pilot regime to the Commission. On the basis of ESMA’s assessment, the Commission will produce a report including a cost-benefit analysis on whether the pilot regime should be maintained as it is or amended, whether it should be extended to new categories of financial instruments, whether targeted amendments to EU legislation should be considered to enable a widespread use of DLT and whether the pilot regime should be terminated. Budgetary implications This proposal holds implications in terms of costs and administrative burden for national competent authorities and the European Securities and Markets Authority. The magnitude and distribution of these costs will depend on the precise requirements placed on DLT market infrastructures and the related supervisory and monitoring tasks. The estimated supervisory costs for each Member State (including staff, training, IT infrastructure) can range from EUR 150 000 to EUR 250 000 per year per DLT market infrastructure. For ESMA, the estimated cost in relation to review and coordination are estimated at EUR 150 000-EUR 300 000 in total. These costs shall be covered by ESMA’s operating budget, which shall be increased. In addition, ESMA is expected to maintain a register of DLT market infrastructures in operation, the costs related to this are considered to be covered by the costs relating to the maintenance of the register."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the Commission recently reviewed Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 which amended Regulation (EU) 531/2012 and abolished roaming surcharges from June 2017 for an initial period of five years, subject to fair use of roaming services and the option to apply a sustainability derogation mechanism. In November 2019, the Commission published its first full review of the roaming market, showing that travellers across the EU have benefited significantly from the end of roaming charges in June 20178. The use of mobile services (data, voice, SMS) while travelling in the EU has increased rapidly and massively, confirming the positive impact of roaming rules. The review also concluded that the current wholesale and retail regulation is still necessary to ensure the viability of roaming. The Commission is therefore proposing a new regulation to extend the current rules, which expire in 2022, by ten years. The proposal to revise the existing roaming rules is part of the overarching ambition ‘A Europe fit for the digital age’ and the specific objective ‘Digital for consumers’. CONTENT: this proposal for a recast of Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 aims to extend the rules applicable to the EU-wide roaming market until 30 June 2032, while adjusting the maximum wholesale charges to ensure sustainability of the provision of retail roaming services at domestic prices, introducing new measures to increase transparency and ensuring a genuine ‘roam-like-at-home’ experience in terms of quality of service and access to emergency services while roaming. The proposed amendments to the existing rules are as follows: Sustainability of roaming for operators The Commission proposes to set EU-wide wholesale roaming maximum charges for calls made, SMS messages and data at lower levels than those valid until 30 June 2022. The proposal sets out a two-step glide path for the maximum wholesale charges applicable for data, voice and SMS. The new maximum wholesale charges should act as a safeguard level and should ensure that operators can recover their costs. Increased transparency The proposed amendments aim to increase transparency at retail level regarding: - quality of service (by bringing in an obligation for operators to clarify in their contracts with customers the quality of service that they can reasonably expect when roaming in the EU); - communications on value-added services (by obliging operators to provide, in their contracts with customers, information on the type of services that may be subject to higher charges and similar information in the ‘welcome SMS’); - access to emergency services (by bringing in an obligation for operators to include information on the different possibilities to access emergency services when roaming in the ‘welcome SMS’). The proposal also aims to increase the level of transparency at wholesale level by creating a centralised EU database of number ranges for value added services. This database would give operators direct access to information on numbering ranges that may lead to higher costs in Member States. Improving the quality of roaming services offered to travellers The proposal obliges roaming service providers to ensure, where technically feasible, that roaming services are provided under the same conditions as if they were consumed domestically and mobile network operators to provide access to all available network technologies and generations). Free-of-charge access to emergency services abroad The proposed new rules would ensure effective access to emergency services, including by improving information on alternative means available to people with disabilities. To this end, the proposal provides for: - the obligation for operators to provide in the wholesale agreement all regulatory and technical information needed to implement free-of-charge access to emergency services and free-of-charge caller location; - the obligation not to levy on the roaming provider any charge related to emergency communications and transmission of caller location information. The proposal also includes a number of amendments to simplify and reduce the regulatory burden. Improving the quality of roaming services offered to travellers The proposal obliges roaming service providers to ensure, where technically feasible, that roaming services are provided on the same terms and conditions as for domestic consumption of those services, and mobile network operators to provide access to all available network generations and technologies.

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU and the Republic of Moldova have developed a close political and economic relationship over the years. The last Association Agenda for 2017-2019 has been extended over the period of one year (due to the pandemic last year), whilst a new document is under preparation, covering the 2021-2027 period. Moldova's economic ties with the EU are also well developed. The EU continues to be Moldova’s largest trading partner, accounting for 52% of its total trade in 2020. Moldova’s economy has been affected significantly by the 2020 recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the protracted political stalemate in the country after the Presidential elections in November 2020, as well as the recent energy crisis. The situation contributed to Moldova’s sizable financing gap, deteriorating external position, and growing fiscal needs. Following the election in July 2021, the new Moldovan government has demonstrated a strong commitment to further reforms, with an ambitious programme ‘Moldova in good times 2021-2025’, focusing on key policy areas including, among others, justice sector reforms, fight against corruption, good governance and the rule of law. With the renewed reform-commitment and strong political will, the authorities have significantly accelerated on reform implementation, which has also allowed Moldova to successfully complete the COVID-19 macro-financial assistance operation. In view of a worsening economic situation and outlook, Moldova requested a complementary macro-financial assistance from the Union in November 2021. The proposed MFA would help Moldova cover part of its residual external financing needs, which are estimated at USD 480 million, in the context of the new IMF programme over the period of 2021-2025. Given that Moldova is a country covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, it should be considered to be eligible to receive macro-financial assistance from the Union. CONTENT: the Union will provide macro-financial assistance of a maximum amount of EUR 150 million available to Moldova, with a view to supporting Moldova's economic stabilisation and a substantive reform agenda. Of that maximum amount, up to EUR 120 million will be provided in the form of loans and up to EUR 30 million in the form of grants. The loans will have a maximum average maturity of 15 years. Moreover, the assistance will contribute to covering Moldova's balance of payments needs as identified in the IMF programme. The Commission is considering releasing the assistance in three instalments: - the disbursement of the first instalment is expected to take place mid-2022; - the second instalment could be disbursed in early 2023; - the third tranche could follow later that year or in the first half of 2024, provided that the policy measures attached to each instalment have been implemented in a timely manner. It should be noted that a pre-condition for granting the Union's macro-financial assistance will be that Moldova respects effective democratic mechanisms – including a multi-party parliamentary system – and the rule of law, and guarantees respect for human rights. The proposed MFA would be made available for two and a half years, starting from the first day after the entry into force of the Memorandum of Understanding. They Commission should regularly inform the European Parliament and the Council of developments relating to MFA. Budgetary implications The financial programming of the EUR 150 million assistance over the 2022-2024 period allows for a grant component of EUR 30 million to be financed from the available budget on budget line 14 20 03 01 ‘Macro-financial assistance (MFA) – grants’'. For the loan component of EUR 120 million, the required provisioning at a rate of 9% of the External Action Guarantee will be programmed under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), for a total amount of EUR 10.8 million (budget line 14 02 01 70 ‘NDICI – Provisioning of the Common Provisioning Fund’)."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the e-CODEX system (Justice Communication via On-line Data Exchange) is a tool specifically designed to facilitate the cross-border electronic exchange of messages in the field of justice. It currently facilitates electronic communication between citizens and courts as well as between Member States' administrations in certain cross-border civil and criminal proceedings. It facilitates secure communication in civil and criminal proceedings via a tailor-made solution for the cross-border exchange of electronic messages in the area of judicial cooperation. e-CODEX has so far been managed by a consortium of Member States and organisations with funding from EU programmes. The total cost of developing the system has amounted to approximately EUR 24 million, of which 50% was funded by the EU in the form of grants and 50% by the participating Member States. The long-term sustainability, increased use and operational management of e-CODEX are a priority for the EU. e-CODEX could be used to enable more efficient judicial cooperation between judicial authorities in criminal matters, thus stepping up the fight against cross-border crime, terrorism and cybercrime. Given the importance of the e-CODEX system for cross-border exchanges in the field of justice, the Commission considers it necessary to provide the EU with a sustainable legal framework for the e-CODEX system by defining the rules for its operation and development and by designating an entity capable of ensuring the operational management of the system. CONTENT: the proposal for a Regulation establishes the e-CODEX system and entrusts its operational management to the European Union Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems within the area of freedom, security and justice (eu-LISA). Scope of application The Regulation would apply to the electronic transmission of information in cross-border civil and criminal proceedings through the e-CODEX system, in accordance with legal instruments adopted in civil and criminal cooperation. Composition, functions and responsibilities of the e-CODEX system The proposal: - defines: (i) the e-CODEX system and its component parts, i.e. access point software; (ii) the responsibilities of eu-LISA with regard to the operational management of the e-CODEX system; (iii) the responsibilities of entities operating authorised e-CODEX access points; - instructs Member States to maintain an up-to-date list of authorised e-CODEX access points operating on their territory and to nominate correspondents who are entitled to receive assistance on how to use the e-CODEX system. Transfer of the e-CODEX system by the entity managing this system to eu-LISA The earliest date proposed for the takeover would be 1 July 2023, to allow eu-LISA time to complete the tasks already entrusted to it in relation to the EES, ETIAS and ECRIS-TCN systems, to modernise the Schengen Information System (SIS) and VIS and to ensure the interoperability of EU information systems. Once eu-LISA takes over responsibility for the system, at the earliest on 1 July 2023, it should: - ensure, on the basis of technical and service-level requirements set out in implementing acts, that the existing software remains functional in a changing technical environment and is adapted to evolving user needs; - maintain or update the digital templates for the different procedures where e-CODEX will be used to respond to legal or organisational changes and create new ones for those instruments within the scope of the regulation in which e-CODEX is introduced. The entity managing the e-CODEX system would continue to be responsible for it until the successful finalisation of the handover/takeover process. The process of handing over the system to eu-LISA is scheduled to take no more than 6 months starting on 1 January 2023. During this period, the entity managing the e-CODEX system would retain full responsibility for the e-CODEX system. The Agency should recruit the necessary staff and plan for procurement activities accordingly. The proposal establishes a Programme Management Board (PMB) which will assist eu-LISA Management Board to ensure the adequate management of the e-CODEX system. Budgetary implications The total costs for 2022-2027 amount to EUR 9.667 million (average cost per year of EUR 1.611 million). Of this amount, the eu-LISA funding for the same period is EUR 8.723 million."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 610/2013 amended the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement (CISA), Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 (Schengen Borders Code) and Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 (the Visa Code). In so doing, it has redefined the term of ‘short-stay’ for third-country nationals in the Schengen area. As from 18 October 2013, for third-country nationals – irrespective of being visa required or exempt – who intend to travel to the Schengen area for a short-stay, the maximum duration of authorised stay is defined as '90 days in any 180-day period'. The agreement between the Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver should incorporate this new definition . With a view to implementing the new definition of short stay provided for in the amendment to the Schengen Borders Code, the Commission adopted on 16 July 2014 a recommendation for a Council Decision authorising negotiations to amend the Schengen the short-stay visa waiver between the European Union and seven countries: Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Mauritius, Saint Kitts and Nevis and the Seychelles. The negotiations with Brazil were successfully finalised on 31 October 2017 by the initialling of the agreements amending the two Agreements between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of diplomatic, service or official passports, and for holders of ordinary passports. Both parties have agreed to adopt the new definition of 'short-stay', among other technical details, but all amendments are insignificant from the traveller's point of view. CONTENT: the Commission calls on the Council to adopt a decision aiming to approve the Agreement between the European Union and Brazil on the short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports . The final content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: Purpose and duration of stay : the Agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the European Union and for the citizens of Brazil when travelling to the other Contracting Party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period (instead of a maximum period of three months during a six months period following the date of first entry). An amendment has been made clarifying that a suspension of the visa waiver shall actually be lifted if the reasons that led to the suspension disappear. On this point, the amendment aligns the wording of the agreement with Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports with that of all other visa waiver agreements signed by the Union in 2015 and 2016. Entry into force : the Agreement will enter into force on the first day of the 6th month following the date on which the last Contracting Party notifies the other that the ratification procedures have been completed. To ensure legal certainty and enable travellers to comprehend the law and to comply with it, a sufficiently long transitional period is necessary. Once ratification of the Agreement has been completed, the six-month period will allow travellers to complete short stays that are still entirely calculated under the old definition, before entry into force of the new short-stay definition and its 180-day backward-looking reference period. All other provisions of the existing agreement between the European Union and Brazil on short-stay visa waiver for holders of ordinary passports remain unaffected by the Agreement, including the territorial scope. Territorial application : the provisions of the Agreement do not apply to the United Kingdom or to Ireland. The Union has no power to amend visa waiver agreements that would bind the four countries that are associated with the implementation of the Schengen acquis, including the common visa policy. In order to ensure a harmonised approach and implementation of the provisions on the duration of authorised stay in the Schengen area, a joint declaration is included in the Agreement, stating the desirability for Brazil, on the one hand, and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, on the other, to accordingly modify their existing bilateral visa waiver agreements."

PURPOSE: to set up a European Partnership on Metrology jointly undertaken by several Member States. PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Articles 2 and 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union enshrine the right to equality between women and men as one of the core values and tasks of the Union. The European pillar of social rights, jointly proclaimed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, includes among its principles equal treatment of women and men and the right to equal pay for work of equal value. Despite Directive 2006/54/EC, supplemented in 2014 by a Commission Recommendation on pay transparency, the effective implementation of the principle of equal pay remains problematic in practice in the EU. The gender pay gap in the EU remains at around 14%. The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences on female workers make it even more urgent to address this issue. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for more action at EU level to improve the implementation of equal pay provisions. The Council has called on both the Member States and the Commission to act. Following the evaluation of the existing framework on equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, the gender equality strategy 2020-2025 announced binding measures on pay transparency. CONTENT: the proposed directive aims to address the persistent inadequacy in the application of the fundamental right to equal pay and to ensure that this right is respected throughout the EU, by setting standards for pay transparency to enable workers to assert their right to equal pay. Member States could provide for a higher level of protection than that guaranteed by the Directive. Same work and work of equal value The proposal requires Member States to establish tools or methodologies to assess and compare the value of work in line with a set of objective criteria which include educational, professional and training requirements, skills, effort and responsibility, work undertaken and the nature of the tasks involved. The availability of clear criteria at national level will help workers to establish a valid comparator and assess whether they are treated less favourably than the comparator performing the same work or work of equal value. Pay transparency The proposal: - requires employers to provide, prior to the job interview, information on the initial pay level or a corresponding range (based on objective and gender-neutral criteria) to be paid to the future worker in relation to a specific position or job. Employers would not have the right to ask applicants about their pay history in their former employment relationship; - requires employers to make available to workers a description of the gender-neutral criteria used to define their pay and career progression; - gives workers the right to ask their employer for information on their individual pay level and on average pay levels, broken down by sex, for categories of workers performing the same work or work of equal value; - requires employers with at least 250 workers to make publicly accessible certain information, such as the pay gap between female and male workers in their organisation. On the basis of the information provided, employees and their representatives would have the right to ask the employer for clarification of this information; - obliges the employers concerned to carry out a pay assessment in cooperation with employee representatives where the pay information indicates a gender pay gap of at least 5%, which the employer cannot justify on the basis of objective and gender-neutral factors. Better access to justice for victims of pay discrimination With regard to redress and enforcement, the proposal: - requires Member States to ensure that judicial procedures are available to enforce the rights and obligations under the Directive; - introduces the right for equality bodies and workers’ representatives or other legal entities to act on behalf or in support of a worker, and for them to bring collective claims to court; - obliges Member States to ensure that any worker who is a victim of sex discrimination in pay can obtain full compensation for the harm caused; - increases the burden of proof on the employer: the employer, not the worker, should prove the absence of discrimination in relation to pay; - provides that the limitation period for bringing a claim under the proposed Directive should be at least three years; - requires Member States to establish specific penalties for infringements of the equal pay rule, including minimum fines."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 (TEN-E Regulation) has enabled the EU to achieve the main objectives of its energy policy by establishing rules for the definition and development of projects of common interest (PCIs), which will ensure the interoperability of trans-European energy networks, the functioning of the internal energy market, security of supply in the Union and the integration of renewable energies. While the objectives of Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 remain largely valid, the current TEN-E framework does not yet fully reflect the expected changes to the energy system that will result from the new political context and in particular the upgraded 2030 targets and the 2050 climate neutrality objective under the European Green Deal. The EU needs to significantly increase electricity production from renewable sources if the share of electricity generated from renewable energy sources, increasingly located offshore, is to exceed 80% by 2050. It is estimated that the upscale of offshore renewable energy in Europe by 2050 would cost EUR 800 billion, two-thirds of which would be spent on associated grid infrastructure. The European Council endorsed an electricity interconnection target of at least 15 %. An estimated annual average investment of EUR 50.5 billion for electricity transmission and distribution grids is required for achieving the 2030 targets alone. Hydrogen is expected to account for approximately 46% - 49% of all renewable and low-carbon gases in 2050. By 2030, total investments needs in hydrogen electrolysers are estimated between EUR 24-42 billion. About EUR 65 billion would be needed for hydrogen transport, distribution and storage. To move towards a climate-neutral economy powered by clean energy, Europe therefore needs new infrastructures adapted to new technologies. CONTENT: the proposal for a revision of the EU rules on Trans-European Energy Networks (TEN-E) aims in particular to: - enable the identification of cross-border projects and investments throughout the EU and with neighbouring countries that are necessary for energy transition and the achievement of climate objectives; - improve infrastructure planning for energy system integration and offshore grids; - shorten permitting procedures for PCIs to avoid delays in projects that facilitate the energy transition. Sustainability criteria All projects should meet mandatory sustainability criteria and respect the ‘do no harm’ principle as set out in the Green Deal in order to allow a rapid and cost-efficient decarbonisation of the energy system and the economy more generally. Categories of eligible infrastructure The proposal updates the categories of infrastructure eligible for financial support under the TEN-E policy, removing support for oil and gas infrastructure. In particular, the proposal: - updates the criteria for smart electricity grids, taking into account elements relating to innovation and digital aspects. Smart grid technologies should help to improve energy network support for high-capacity recharging to support the decarbonisation of the transport sector; - gives a greater role to renewable and low-carbon gases by creating a new category of infrastructure for smart gas networks. The objective is to support investments in distribution and/or transport to integrate green gases (typically biogas and biomethane, but also hydrogen) into the network based on innovative technologies; - focuses on infrastructures using hydrogen, including transport and certain types of electrolysers; - insists on the need to develop the network necessary for the expected considerable increase in electricity production from offshore grids for renewable energy sources. Governance The proposal: - revises the governance framework by increasing stakeholder involvement throughout the process, strengthening the role of the EU Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) and enhanced oversight by the Commission; - reinforces the transparency obligation imposed on project promoters and revises existing provisions in order to increase clarity and transparency of cross-border cost allocation and speed up investments in cross-border infrastructure; - introduces new provisions on support for interconnection projects with third countries (projects of mutual interest or PMIs) that demonstrate their mutual interest and contribution to the overall EU energy and climate objectives of security of supply and decarbonisation; - updates the eligibility of projects for Union financial assistance for the new infrastructure categories. While projects of mutual interest will be eligible for Union financial assistance, only the investments located on the territory of the Union will be eligible for Union financial assistance from the Connecting Europe Facility in the form of grants for works under specific conditions. Budgetary implications ACER would take on additional responsibilities in monitoring the 10-year network development plan. This requires a limited number of additional resources. The impact on expenditure is estimated at EUR 0.889 million for the period 2022-2027."

PROPOSED ACT: Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Council Decision 2003/17/EC provides that, under certain conditions, field inspections carried out in the third countries listed in its Annex I on certain seed-producing crops are to be considered equivalent to field inspections carried out in accordance with Union law and that, under certain conditions, seed of certain cereal species produced in those countries is to be considered equivalent to seed produced in accordance with Union law. Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022. On 29 January 2016, Bolivia submitted a request to the Commission to consider seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia as offering the same assurances as regards identity, health and quality as seed produced in the EU on the basis of official controls carried out by the competent authorities of that country. Following this request, the Commission assessed the relevant Bolivian legislation and carried out an audit of the Bolivian seed production and certification system. The Commission identified shortcomings and made recommendations to Bolivia. As Bolivia addressed these shortcomings by 30 November 2018, the Commission recognised that the Bolivian system in place offered the same assurance as the EU system. CONTENT: the proposed Decision aims to grant equivalence in respect of field inspections of seed producing crops of sorghum, maize and sunflower carried out in Bolivia and in respect of seed of sorghum, maize and sunflower produced in Bolivia and officially certified by its authorities. As Decision 2003/17/EC expires on 31 December 2022, it is proposed to extend by 7 years (until 31 December 2029) the period for which equivalence is recognised under that Decision, in order to avoid any risk of disruption of seed imports into the Union. The proposal will stimulate seed trade between Bolivia and the EU. Granting the EU equivalence would therefore contribute to the maintenance of the continuous supply of high quality seed in the EU. It could also make it more attractive for EU-based companies to invest in the agricultural development of Bolivia given that the EU would become an export market."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: in the interests of clarity and transparency of EU law, the aim of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Directive 2008/106/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the minimum level of training of seafarers, which has been substantially amended several times. The new Directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; it fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. CONTENT: the proposed Directive incorporates into EU law the provisions of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, 1978, of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), (STCW Convention), which was the subject of a major revision at a Conference of the Parties to the STCW Convention held in Manila in 2010. Further amendments to the Convention were adopted in 2015 and 2016. As all Member States are Parties to the STCW Convention, the harmonisation of EU regulations on the training and certification of seafarers with the STCW Convention aims to ensure consistent implementation of their international commitments. Specifically, the proposal: - sets out the training rules and standards of competence to be met by candidate seafarers in order to obtain or revalidate a certificate enabling them to perform the duties for which the certificate of competency or proficiency is issued. Training for seafarers should cover proper theoretical and practical training so as to ensure that seafarers are qualified to meet security and safety standards and are able to respond to hazards and emergencies; - obliges Member States to adopt and enforce specific measures to prevent and penalise fraudulent practices related to certificates of competency or certificates of proficiency; - lays down criteria for the inspection of maritime training establishments, training programmes and courses; - contains provisions on minimum rest periods for watchkeeping personnel to improve maritime safety and the prevention of pollution at sea; - provides for measures to ensure communication between crew members of ships sailing in EU waters; - establishes common criteria for the recognition by the Member States of seafarers’ certificates issued by third countries, based on the training and certification requirements as agreed in the framework of the STCW Convention; - improves the effectiveness of the centralised mechanism for the recognition of seafarers’ certificates from third countries and enhances legal clarity with regard to the mutual recognition of seafarers' certificates issued by Member States. The proposal provides that a reassessment of third countries which provide a low number of seafarers to ships flying the flags of Member States should be performed at intervals of ten years."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: this proposal for a Regulation on European Data Governance (Data Governance Act) is the first concrete action in the framework of the European Data Strategy. In its Data Strategy, the Commission described the vision of a common European data space, a Single Market for data in which data could be used irrespective of its physical location of storage in the EU in compliance with applicable law. It also called for the free and safe flow of data with third countries, subject to exceptions and restrictions for public security, public order and other legitimate public policy objectives of the European Union. The Commission proposed to establish domain specific common European data spaces, as the concrete arrangements in which data sharing and data pooling can happen. Such common European data spaces can cover areas such as health, mobility, manufacturing, financial services, energy, or agriculture or thematic areas, such as the European green deal or European data spaces for public administration or skills. In this context, it is necessary to improve the conditions for data sharing in the internal market, by creating a harmonised framework for data exchanges. A single market for data should ensure that data from the public sector, businesses and citizens can be accessed and used in the most effective and responsible manner possible, while businesses and citizens keep control of the data they generate and the investments made into their collection are safeguarded. IMPACT ASSESSMENT: according to the impact assessment support study, while in the baseline scenario the data economy and the economic value of data sharing is expected to increase to an estimated EUR 510-533 billion (3.87% of GDP), this would rise to EUR 540.7-544.4 billion (3.92%-3.95% of GDP) depending on the preferred option. CONTENT: the proposed Regulation aims to promote the availability of data for use, by increasing trust in data intermediaries and strengthening data sharing mechanisms across the EU. Re-use of certain data held by the public sector The proposal creates a mechanism to enhance the use of certain public sector data, conditional on the respect of the rights of others (notably on grounds of protection of personal data, but also protection of intellectual property rights and commercial confidentiality). Public sector bodies authorising such re-use should be technically equipped to ensure that data protection, privacy and confidentiality are fully preserved. The proposal: - defines a set of harmonised basic conditions, the respect of which would allow the re-use of data (e.g. the non-exclusivity requirement); - obliges Member States to set up (i) a single contact point to help researchers and innovative companies select identify suitable data, and (ii) structures that will support public sector bodies with technical means and legal assistance. Creation of a notification regime for data sharing service providers In order to increase trust in the sharing of personal and non-personal data and lower transaction costs to B2B and C2B data sharing by creating a notification regime for data sharing providers, providers of data-sharing services would have to comply with a number of requirements, including the obligation to remain neutral with regard to the data exchanged and not to use such data for other purposes. A competent authority designated by the Member States would be responsible for monitoring compliance with the requirements relating to the provision of data sharing services. Data Altruism In order to facilitate altruistic data (data voluntarily made available by individuals or companies for the common good), the proposal gives data altruistic organisations the possibility to register as a ‘Data Altruism Organisation recognised in the EU’ in order to increase trust in their operations. Governance The proposal: - sets out the requirements for the functioning of the competent authorities designated to monitor and implement the notification framework for data-sharing service providers and entities engaged in data altruism. It also contains provisions on the right to lodge complaints against the decisions of such bodies and on the means of judicial redress; - creates a formal expert group (the ‘European Data Innovation Board’), which will facilitate the emergence of best practice by Member State authorities and advise the Commission on the governance of cross-sectoral standardisation."

PROPOSED ACT: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: pursuant to the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol, which is an integral part of the UK Withdrawal Agreement, medicines placed on the market in Northern Ireland must be covered by a valid marketing authorisation issued by the Commission (EU-wide authorisations) or the United Kingdom (UK) in respect of Northern Ireland. These national authorisations should be in compliance with the obligations of the EU acquis for medicinal products. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021) for maintaining batch testing and manufacturing / logistics in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to ensure undisrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it still proves very difficult for certain operators currently based in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to adapt and move relevant regulatory compliance functions (namely, the marketing authorisation holder, quality control (batch) testing, the qualified persons responsible for batch testing pharmacovigilance) to Northern Ireland or the EU in respect of nationally authorised products, as required by the Protocol. Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council lay down rules concerning medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products intended to be placed on the market in the Member States. In order to avoid shortages of medicinal products and to ensure a high level of public health protection, these Directives need to be amended to provide for derogations for medicinal products supplied to Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland from parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal provides for derogations from Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to ensure the long-term continuity of supply of generic and innovative medicines to Northern Ireland from the UK and to address the remaining supply problems in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. The proposal exceptionally allows the following: - the marketing authorisation holder and the manufacturing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - batch checks may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch controls and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland or Malta will be able to purchase and obtain medicinal products from a third country (parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing authorisation and without the need to repeat batch checks; This proposal allows exceptionally that: - a marketing authorisation holder may be established in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the manufacturing authorisation holder may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the batch testing may be carried out in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - the qualified person for batch testing and pharmacovigilance may be located in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; - an EU wholesaler located in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland, or Malta may purchase and obtain medicines from a third country (parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland) without holding a manufacturing import authorisation and without re-testing the products; - the competent authorities of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland may temporarily authorise the supply to patients in Northern Ireland of a medicinal product provided that (i) the medicinal product concerned has obtained a marketing authorisation issued by the competent authority of the United Kingdom for parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland; and (ii) the medicinal product concerned is made available to patients or end-users only within the territory of Northern Ireland and is not made available in any Member State; - the UK should comply with EU legislation on the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products for human use when issuing marketing authorisations for Northern Ireland. Malta, Cyprus and Ireland will have certain derogations for a period of three years (until 31 December 2024). In these three countries, during this period, importers of medicinal products from the UK will not be required to hold manufacturing authorisations, nor will such medicinal products be required to undergo batch testing if such testing has already been carried out in the UK. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 as regards a derogation from certain obligations concerning investigational medicinal products made available in the United Kingdom with respect to Northern Ireland as well as in Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules for investigational medicinal products intended to be used in clinical trials in the Union. According to the Regulation, read in conjunction with the Ireland/Northern Ireland Protocol to the UK Withdrawal Agreement, the importation of investigational medicinal products from third countries into the Union or Northern Ireland is subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland have always relied on the supply of medicines, including investigational medicines, from or through parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland. On 25 January 2021, the Commission issued a notice on the application of the EU pharmaceutical acquis in markets historically dependent on the supply of medicines from or via Great Britain (i.e. Cyprus, Ireland, Malta and Northern Ireland) after the end of the transitional period. This notice provides for a one-year grace period (until the end of December 2021), including for import requirements for investigational medicinal products, in order to ensure an uninterrupted supply of medicines to Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta. Despite the transition period, it is still proving very difficult for some operators currently based in parts of the UK other than Northern Ireland to adapt as required by the Protocol. An interruption in the supply of investigational medicinal products would present a potential risk to the safety and well-being of participants in ongoing clinical trials and would hamper the establishment of new clinical trials in these Member States and Northern Ireland. CONTENT: the proposal to amend Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 aims to provide for exemptions for medicinal products distributed in Northern Ireland, Cyprus, Ireland and Malta that are used as investigational medicinal products in clinical trials in those countries. Specifically, the proposal provides that the importation of investigational medicinal products from other parts of the United Kingdom into Northern Ireland and, until 31 December 2024, into Cyprus, Ireland and Malta is not subject to the holding of a manufacturing and import authorisation, provided that the following conditions are met: - the investigational medicinal products have undergone certification of batch release either in the Union or in parts of the United Kingdom other than Northern Ireland to verify compliance with the requirements set out in Article 63(1); - the investigational medicinal products are only made available to clinical trial participants in the Member State into which the investigational medicinal products are imported or, if imported into Northern Ireland, are only made available to clinical trial participants in Northern Ireland. This proposal should be read in conjunction with the proposal to amend Directives 2001/20/EC and 2001/83/EC in order to introduce exemptions from certain obligations relating to medicinal products for human use available in the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Ireland, as well as Cyprus, Ireland and Malta."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: due to the recent military aggression by Russia against Ukraine, the European Union and in particular its eastern regions are facing a massive influx of people. This poses an additional challenge for public budgets at a time when Member States’ economies are still recovering from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and risks undermining the preparation of a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. Member States are already able to finance a broad range of investments to address migratory challenges under their operational programmes with support from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD), including from the additional resources made available as Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe (REACT-EU). The Commission has already taken steps to assist Member States in this regard, through its ‘Cohesion Action for Refugees in Europe’ (CARE) initiative of 8 March 2022. Notwithstanding the room for manoeuvre offered by the CARE package, Member States face additional immediate budgetary pressures arising from the management of mass arrivals of people fleeing Ukraine. Therefore, support from the Funds should be mobilised quickly to ease the burden on national budgets. The Commission therefore considers it necessary, as a temporary and exceptional measure, to increase the amount of pre-financing paid under REACT-EU for all Member States. BACKGROUND: this proposal provides for exceptional and targeted changes to the 2014-2020 legal framework established for the European Structural and Investment Funds and for the Fund for the European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD) in response to the invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation and the subsequent impact on the European Union and several of its eastern regions in particular. It is proposed to amend Regulations (EU) No 1303/2013 and (EU) No 223/2014 in order to provide for an increased percentage of pre-financing to be paid under REACT-EU, which is necessary to respond to this unprecedented situation. In addition to the initial pre-financing, the Commission will pay 4% of the REACT-EU resources allocated to programmes for the year 2021 as additional initial pre-financing in 2022. For programmes in Member States which have had a level of arrivals of persons from Ukraine greater than 1% of their national population between 24 February 2022 and 23 March 2022, that percentage shall be increased to 34%. In order to monitor the use of this additional pre-financing, the final reports on the implementation of ERDF and ESF programmes benefiting from such pre-financing should include information on how the additional amounts received have been used to address the migration challenges linked to Russia's military aggression and have contributed to the recovery of the economy. BUDGETARY IMPLICATIONS: this proposal only concerns REACT-EU, which is financed by the European Recovery Instrument NextGenerationEU. The additional initial pre-financing payments in 2022 will be financed from external assigned revenues. All amounts will be available as external assigned revenues, within the meaning of the Financial Regulation stemming from the Next GenerationEU borrowing operations. The amount paid as additional initial pre-financing will be totally cleared from the Commission accounts not later than when the operational programme is closed, such that the total amount of payments made under REACT-EU will remain unchanged with this proposal. Similarly, the total commitment appropriations under REACT-EU will not be modified."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU is faced with potential threats to the security of gas supply, mainly linked to its dependence for primary energy from third countries. The escalation of the armed conflict in Ukraine since February 2022 has led to unprecedented price increases. These price increases are likely to fundamentally change the incentives to fill storage facilities in the Union. In the current geopolitical context, further supply disruptions of gas can no longer be excluded. This could severely harm citizens and the economy of the Union, as the Union is still to a significant extent dependent on external gas supplies which can be affected by the conflict. It is therefore crucial that the EU acts in a coordinated manner to avoid potential risks resulting from a possible gas supply interruption. CONTENT: this proposal amends two existing regulations, Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 concerning measures to safeguard the security of gas supply and Regulation (EU) 715/2009 on conditions for access to natural gas transmission networks. It builds on the existing framework for gas security of supply and internal gas market rules, adding further measures needed to ensure security of supply of natural gas in the Union in the context of the severe energy crisis caused by recent changes of the geopolitical situation. The proposal aims notably at ensuring that storage capacities in the Union, which are crucial to ensure security of supply, do not remain unused, to ensure that storages can be shared across the Union, in a spirit of solidarity. Mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities The proposal seeks to ensure that a mandatory minimum level of gas in storage facilities will reinforce the security of supply ahead of the winter 2022/2023 and for the following winter periods. A new provision will require the Member States to ensure that the storage infrastructures in its territory are, in principle, filled up to at least 90% of their capacity at Member State level by 1 November each year, with intermediary targets for each Member State in February, May, July, and September. For 2022, the filling target is set at 80% of the capacity of all storage facilities located on the territory of the respective Member States. The Commission is mandated to ensure that the filling targets are met in case intermediate targets are missed. Certification of storage system operators A new mandatory certification of all storage system operators will avoid potential risks resulting from outside influence over critical storage infrastructure, meaning that non-certified operators will have to give up ownership or control of EU gas storage facilities. In addition, for a gas storage facility to close down its operations it would need to have an authorisation from the national regulator. Burden sharing mechanism The proposal introduced a burden sharing mechanism, as although not all Member States have storage facilities in their territories, all will benefit from having a guaranteed high filling level, in terms of the insurance value against security of supply risks and price dampening effects in winter. New filling obligations Competent authorities will continuously monitor the filling of the underground storage facilities in order to ensure that their national filling trajectories are met. This new provision also reinforces the role of the Gas Coordination Group, giving it an explicit mandate to monitor Member States' performance in the area of gas security of supply, and to develop best practices on that basis. Tariff rebate In order to incentivise the refilling of EU gas storage facilities, the Commission is proposing a 100% discount on capacity-based transmission tariffs at entry and exit points of storage facilities."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 of the European Parliament and of the Council on persistent organic pollutants (POPs Regulation) implements the Union's commitments under the Stockholm Convention on POPs, approved by Council Decision 2006/507/EC, and the Protocol to the 1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution on Persistent Organic Pollutants, approved by Council Decision 2004/259/EC. All POP substances are recognised to have adverse, generally long-term effects upon living organisms . They persist for a very long time in the environment and in our bodies and can be transported unchanged to almost any remote point of the globe, far away from where they were produced or used. Management of POP waste, including its recycling where this is possible, should be carried out in an environmentally sound manner, with minimal impact on human health and the environment. It should also minimise the extent to which toxic substances are released into the environment, and thus contribute to the zero-pollution ambition by reducing their environmental and health impact. CONTENT: the proposal aims to implement, for the substances within its scope, the EU’s international obligations under the Stockholm Convention and, more specifically, those derived from the POPs Regulation. The proposed update brings Annexes IV and V of the Regulation into line with the Stockholm Convention and Annex I of the POPs Regulation by aligning them with the substances listed therein and by introducing concentration limits for these substances. Taking into account the amendments made to the Stockholm Convention on 15 May 2015 and in order to ensure that waste containing these substances is managed in accordance with the provisions of the Stockholm Convention, the Commission proposes to amend Annexes IV and V of Regulation (EU) 2019/1021 by including pentachlorophenol, dicofol and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), its salts and PFOA-related compounds in the Annexes and indicating their corresponding concentration limits. It is also proposed to amend the concentration limits set out in Annex IV for the following substances to adapt their limit values to scientific and technical progress: tetrabromodiphenyl ether, pentabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromodiphenyl ether, heptabromodiphenyl ether and decabromodiphenyl ether, hexabromocyclododecane, alkanes C10-C13, chloro (short-chain chlorinated paraffins), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF). Lastly, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dioxin-like PCBs) should be included in the existing group entry for Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDF) in Annexes IV and V of the POP Regulation. The proposal is consistent with the objective of ensuring an optimal balance with the Green Deal for Europe's ambitions to achieve toxic-free material cycles, increasing recycling and circularity and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the EU faces a security landscape in flux, with evolving and increasingly complex security threats. Criminals and terrorists exploit the advantages that the digital transformation and new technologies bring about, including the inter-connectivity and blurring of the boundaries between the physical and digital world. The COVID-19 crisis has added to this, as criminals have quickly seized opportunities to exploit the crisis by adapting their modes of operation or developing new criminal activities. These threats spread across borders and manifest themselves in poly-criminal organised crime groups that engage in a wide range of criminal activities. As action at national level alone does not suffice to address these transnational security challenges, therefore the Commission proposes to enhance Europol’s mandate in order to give further support to Member States’ law enforcement authorities. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: this proposal aims to support and strengthen action by the Member States’ law enforcement services and their mutual cooperation in preventing and combating serious crime affecting two or more Member States, terrorism and forms of crime which affect a common interest covered by a Union policy. Specific provisions of the new mandate The new mandate should: - ensure effective cooperation between Europol and private parties: terrorists often abuse the services provided by private companies to recruit volunteers, to carry out terrorist attacks and to disseminate their propaganda. The revised mandate would allow private parties to refer such information directly to Europol. The Agency would be able to receive personal data directly from private parties and analyse it to identify all Member States concerned; request personal data from private parties (via the Member State where it is located); and act as a channel for Member States' requests to private parties, in compliance with data protection requirements; - enable Europol to exchange personal data with private parties related to crisis response: the proposal sets out rules for Europol to support Member States in preventing the large scale dissemination, via online platforms, of terrorist content related to on-going or recent real-world events depicting harm to life or physical integrity. Europol would be able to exchange personal data with private parties, including hashes, IP addresses or URLs related to such content; - allow Europol to analyse large datasets (‘big data') to support criminal investigations, considering that the processing of large data sets is an integral part of police work in today's digital world; - improve Europol's cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, including through analytical support to the work of the European Public Prosecutor's Office and information exchange, and with the European Anti-Fraud Office; - reinforce Europol's role in developing new technologies for law enforcement, helping to equip national law enforcement authorities with modern technologies to counter serious crime and terrorism; - strengthen Europol's data protection framework, accountability and democratic oversight, including by introducing new reporting obligations for Europol to the Joint Parliamentary Scrutiny Group in charge of monitoring its activities. Budgetary implications The proposal would have an impact on the budget and staff needs of Europol. It is estimated that an additional budget of around EUR 180 million and around 160 additional posts would be needed for the overall MFF period to ensure that Europol has the necessary resources to enforce its revised mandate. This increase in staff and budget would give Europol the means to fulfil its strengthened mandate. It would provide the European Counter Terrorism Centre with adequate resources and to enable its EU Internet Referral Unit to monitor and refer all types of terrorist content to online platforms with a 24/7 availability. The revision of Europol's mandate also opens the possibility for Member States to contribute directly to Europol's budget, where necessary and required by existing or new tasks."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: a strong, open and competitive single market allows both European and foreign companies to compete on the basis of merit, provided that a level playing field in the market is guaranteed. In recent years, there have been cases where foreign subsidies have been found to have distorting effects on the EU's internal market, creating an uneven playing field. These foreign subsidies can take different forms, such as zero interest loans, unlimited state guarantees, tax exemptions or reductions for foreign investment or trade, or dedicated State funding. EU rules on competition, public procurement and trade defence instruments play an important role in ensuring a level playing field for companies operating in the single market. However, none of these tools apply to foreign subsidies that give their beneficiaries an unfair advantage when acquiring EU companies, participating in public procurement in the EU or doing other business in the EU. There are currently no specific EU rules to address the distorting effects that foreign subsidies can have on the internal market. It is therefore necessary to complement the existing EU instruments with a new instrument to effectively combat distortions in the internal market caused by foreign subsidies and to ensure a level playing field The legislative proposal aims to fill a regulatory gap in the Single Market. It is in line with the new Industrial Strategy for Europe presented by the Commission in March 2020 and follows the adoption of the White Paper on foreign subsidies in June 2020. CONTENT: the proposed regulation establishes rules and procedures for investigating foreign subsidies that distort the internal market and for remedying the distortions they cause. Such distortions may affect all economic activities, in particular in the case of mergers and public procurement procedures. Under the proposed Regulation, the Commission will have the power to investigate financial contributions granted by public authorities of a non-EU country which benefit companies engaging in an economic activity in the EU and redress their distortive effects, as relevant. In this context, the Regulation proposes the introduction of three tools: - Component 1: a notification-based tool to investigate concentrations involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the EU turnover of the company to be acquired (or of at least one of the merging parties) is EUR 500 million or more and the foreign financial contribution is at least EUR 50 million; - Component 2: a notification-based tool to investigate bids in public procurements involving a financial contribution by a non-EU government, where the estimated value of the procurement is EUR 250 million or more; and - Component 3: a tool to investigate all other market situations and smaller concentrations and public procurement procedures, which the Commission can start on its own initiative (ex-officio) and may request ad-hoc notifications. Ex officio examination of subsidies . The proposal provides that the Commission could, on its own initiative, examine information from any source concerning alleged distortive foreign subsidies, either as a preliminary examination or as a full investigation. It would be able to conduct on-site inspections in the EU and elsewhere. The Commission should take into account the positive effects of the foreign subsidy on the development of the subsidised economic activity in question. It should balance these positive effects against the negative effects of a foreign subsidy in terms of distortion in the internal market. If the negative effects outweigh the positive effects, the Commission could impose remedial measures or accept undertakings from the companies concerned to remedy the distortions. The proposal foresees a range of structural or behavioural remedies, such as divestment of certain assets or prohibition of a certain market behaviour. The Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments for procedural infringements, such as the supply of incorrect or incomplete information in an investigation, and for non-compliance with a Commission decision imposing redressive, interim measures or commitments. Concentration and bids in public procurement As regards mergers and public procurement, the proposal involves a system of ex ante notification of the largest and potentially most distortive case. It sets out the conditions under which a foreign subsidy is considered to distort the internal market. The Commission would have the power, upon notification, to examine information on foreign financial contributions in the context of a proposed merger. Companies should not be allowed to implement the concentration before the conclusion of the Commission's review. The proposal specifies when a concentration should be suspended and sets out the relevant time limits. The proposed Regulation provides that if an undertaking fails to comply with the obligation to notify a subsidised concentration or a financial contribution in the context of public procurement contracts meeting the thresholds, the Commission could impose fines and periodic penalty payments. Fines and periodic penalty payments could also be imposed in the case of notifications containing incorrect information or in the case of failure to notify. In case of notified transactions, the Commission should also have the power to prohibit the subsidised acquisition or the award of the public procurement contract to the subsidised bidder. Budgetary impact The total administrative expenditure for the implementation of the proposal in 2021-2027 will thus amount to EUR 90.340 million, part of which will be financed from the single market programme."

BACKGROUND: Regulation (EU) 2019/6 on veterinary medicinal products entered into force on 28 January 2022. Holders of marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products authorised under Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Union procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use, are not in a position to comply with the requirements set out in Articles 10 to 16 of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 with effect from 28 January 2022. Therefore, it is necessary to take urgent measures to address the concerns raised by Member States' competent authorities and stakeholders about the practical application of Regulation (EU) 2019/6 in order to remove any legal uncertainty and to avoid possible disruptions in the supply of veterinary medicines. CONTENT: the proposal provides for transitional rules in the proposal allow marketing authorisation holders to continue to place veterinary medicinal products complying with the packaging and labelling requirements of Directive 2001/82/EC or Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 on the market until 29 January 2027, even if they do not comply with the relevant requirements of Regulation 2019/6."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: the unprovoked and unjustified military aggression by Russia against Ukraine since 24 February 2022 has seriously weakened Ukraine's ability to trade with the rest of the world, also due to the destruction of production capacities and the unavailability of many means of transport because of the closure of access to the Black Sea. In order to mitigate the negative economic impact of the aggression, the development of closer economic relations between the EU and Ukraine must be accelerated in order to provide rapid support to the Ukrainian authorities and people in these exceptional circumstances. The Commission therefore considers it necessary to stimulate trade flows and to grant concessions in the form of trade liberalisation measures for all products, in line with the acceleration of the elimination of customs duties on trade between the EU and Ukraine. CONTENT: the proposed regulation introduces trade liberalisation measures in the form of the following three measures, which should apply for one year: - temporary suspension of all outstanding tariffs under Title IV of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine establishing a deep and comprehensive free trade area (DCFTA). This concerns three categories of products: (i) industrial products subject to duty phase out by the end of 2022; (ii) fruits and vegetables subject to the entry-price system; (iii) agricultural products and processed agricultural products subject to tariff-rate quotas; - temporary non-collection of anti-dumping duties on imports originating in Ukraine as of the date of entry into force of this Regulation; and - temporary suspension of the application of the common rules for imports (safeguard) with respect of imports originating in Ukraine. The trade-liberalising measures provided for under the present proposal for a Regulation are taken in observance of the commitment in Article 2 of the Association Agreement which enshrines as an essential element of the Agreement the promotion of respect for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and independence. These measures would be conditional upon respect for the same basic principles set out in Article 2, including those providing that the respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for the principle of the rule of law constitute essential elements of that Agreement. Normal safeguard procedures would apply. BUDGETARY IMPLICATION: based on an estimation according to the level of imports from Ukraine in 2021, the EU will see a loss of customs revenue corresponding to less than EUR 31 million annually. The loss of anti-dumping duties is estimated at EUR 34.6 million. This figure is very likely to be significantly lower as the level of imports from Ukraine has been affected by the conflict. Therefore, the impact on the EU’s own resources will be very limited."

BACKGROUND: the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS (Global Positioning System) satellite navigation systems and related applications between the European Community and its Member States, of the one part, and the United States of America, of the other part, was signed in 2004. It entered into force on 12 December 2011 for an initial period of ten years and expires on 12 December 2021. Both Parties have confirmed their intention to renew the agreement for a further period of five years, without any amendment to the Agreement. The Galileo and GPS systems are under further development and evolving. Continued cooperation between the two systems is necessary for a number of reasons, including to ensure compatibility and interoperability. Moreover, the United States is a privileged satellite navigation partner of the Union. It is in the interest of the EU to renew this Agreement in order to continue to further engage in satellite navigation cooperation with the U.S. CONTENT: the Commission proposes that the Council decide to approve, on behalf of the Union, the renewal for a further period of five years of the Agreement on the promotion, provision and use of the Galileo and GPS satellite navigation systems and related applications between the United States of America, on the one hand, and the European Community and its Member States, on the other. The Agreement’s objective is to provide a framework for cooperation between the Parties in the promotion, provision and use of civil GPS and Galileo navigation and timing signals and services, value-added services, augmentations, and global navigation and timing goods. Moreover, the Parties intend to work together, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora, as provided herein, to promote and facilitate the use of these signals, services, and equipment for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific uses, consistent with and in furtherance of mutual security interests. It should be noted that this proposed renewal of the Agreement (i) does not foresee conferring Galileo ownership or decision-making rights to the U.S; (ii) does not give the U.S. the right to participate in the EU GNSS-related Programme Committees or Working Groups; (iii) does not allow the U.S. to participate in Galileo PRS (Public Regulated Service) relevant fora, working groups or discussions."

PROPOSED ACT: Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: the European Parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the Council. BACKGROUND: given the increasingly global nature of serious crime and terrorism brought about by growing mobility, the information that third countries and international organisations obtain about criminals and terrorists is increasingly relevant for the EU‘s security. Such information should contribute to the comprehensive efforts to ensure internal security in the European Union. Some of this information is only shared with Europol. While Europol holds valuable information received from external partners on serious criminals and terrorists, it cannot issue alerts in SIS. Member States are also not always able to issue alerts in SIS on the basis of such information. In order to bridge the gap in information sharing on serious crime and terrorism, in particular on foreign terrorist fighters – where the monitoring of their movement is crucial – it is necessary to ensure Europol is able to make this information available directly and in real-time to front-line officers in Member States. Europol should therefore be authorised to enter alerts in SIS, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection rules. To that end, the Commission proposes that a specific category of alert should be created in SIS, to be issued exclusively by Europol, in order to inform end-users carrying out a search in SIS that the person concerned is suspected of being involved in a criminal offence in respect of which Europol is competent, and in order for Europol to obtain confirmation that the person who is subject to the alert has been located. This Commission proposal is part of the Counter-Terrorism package. CONTENT: the present proposal seeks to amend Regulation (EU) 2018/1862 on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters as regards the entry of alerts by Europol. In particular, it widens the scope of application of the current SIS by introducing a new alert category for Europol. Specific provisions The proposal seeks to: - enable Europol to issue ‘information alerts’ on suspects and criminals as a new alert category in SIS, for exclusive use by Europol in specific and well-defined cases and circumstances. This is an important paradigm change for SIS, as until now, only Member States could enter, update and delete data in SIS and Europol had ‘read-only’ access covering all alert categories. Europol would be able to issue alerts on the basis of its analysis of third-country sourced information or information from international organisations, within the scope of crimes falling under Europol’s mandate and only on third-country nationals who are not beneficiaries of free movement rights. The purpose of the new alert category is that in case of a ‘hit’, the alert would inform the frontline officer that Europol holds information on the person; - set out detailed provisions on the procedural requirements that Europol is required to fulfil prior to entering an alert in SIS; - align the obligations and requirements of Europol when entering alerts in SIS with alert issuing Member States. These requirements concern: categories of data, proportionality, minimum data content for an alert to be entered, entering biometric data, general data processing rules, quality of the data in SIS as well as rules on distinguishing between persons with similar characteristics, misused identity and links. The frontline officer would be required to report immediately the occurrence of the ‘hit’ to the national SIRENE Bureau, which would in turn contact Europol. The frontline officer would only report that the person who is subject of an alert was located and would indicate the place, time and reason for the check carried out; - define the review period for alerts entered by Europol as well as the alert deletion rules which are specific to this type of alert. As a general rule, an alert should be kept only for the time that is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was entered. Budgetary implications The budgetary impact, estimated at EUR 1 820 000 for the period 2021-2022, reflects the changes required for establishing this new alert category in Central SIS by eu-LISA, the EU Agency responsible for the management and development of Central SIS. The expenses related to the development of the national systems connected to Central SIS are to be covered by the resources available to the Member States under the new Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027 for the development and maintenance of SIS. The proposal would also require Europol to set up a technical interface for entering, updating and deleting data in Central SIS."

PROPOSED ACT: Council Decision. ROLE OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: Council may adopt the act only if Parliament has given its consent to the act. BACKGROUND: the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) between Mauritania and the European Community entered into force on 8 August 2008 for a period of six years. The agreement is renewable by tacit agreement and is therefore still in force. A previous four-year protocol for the implementation of the FPA (2015-2019) was extended twice, each time for a period of one year. It expires on 15 November 2021. In 2018, the Commission carried out an ex-post evaluation of the 2015-2019 FPA Protocol, as well as an ex-ante evaluation of a possible renewal of the FPA Protocol. The evaluation concluded that the EU fishing sector has a strong interest in operating in Gabon and that a renewal of the protocol would be in the interest of both parties. In addition, the renewal of the protocol would contribute to strengthening monitoring, control and surveillance, as well as improving the governance of fisheries activities in the region. The Commission conducted negotiations with the Government of Mauritania with a view to concluding, on behalf of the European Union, a new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the Implementing Protocol. Following these negotiations, an agreement and a protocol were initialled by the negotiators on 28 July 2021. The new Agreement covers a period of six years from the date of provisional application, that being the date on which it is signed by both parties. The new Implementing Protocol covers a period of five years from the date of provisional application and contains a clause providing for a review during its second year of application. CONTENT: the purpose of the proposal is to authorise the conclusion of the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Mauritania and the Protocol implementing that Agreement. Objectives The conclusion of the Agreement and its implementing Protocol will make it possible to continue and strengthen the strategic partnership in the fisheries sector between the European Union and Mauritania. The Agreement and the Protocol will also contribute to: - better management and conservation of fishery resources, through financial (sectoral) support for the implementation of programmes adopted at national level by the partner country, in particular the fisheries comprehensive plan, the monitoring and combating of illegal fishing and support for the small-scale fisheries sector; - the sustainable exploitation by Mauritania of its marine resources, as well as Mauritania's fisheries economy, by promoting the growth of fisheries-related economic activities and the establishment of decent working conditions. Fishing opportunities The new Protocol provides for the same fishing opportunities as the current Protocol during the first 2 years of application, except for a marginal adjustment of the reference tonnage for the two types of tuna vessel. Specifically, it covers the following categories: - vessels fishing for crustaceans other than spiny lobster and crab: 5 000 tonnes and 15 vessels; - black hake (non-freezer) trawlers and bottom longliners: 6 000 tonnes and 4 vessels; - pelagic freezer trawlers targeting black hake: 3 500 tonnes of hake, 1 450 tonnes of squid, 600 tonnes of cuttlefish for 6 vessels; - vessels fishing for demersal species other than black hake with gear other than trawls: 3 000 tonnes and 6 vessels; - tuna seiners: 14 000 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 29 vessels; - pole-and-line tuna vessels and tuna longliners: 7 000 tonnes (reference tonnage) and 15 vessels; - pelagic freezer trawlers: 247 500 tonnes and 19 vessels; - non-freezer pelagic vessels: 15 000 tonnes (deducted from the volume under category 6, if used) and 2 vessels. Financial contribution For the first 2 years of application of the Protocol, the annual financial contribution for access to Mauritanian waters and fishery resources in those waters is a maximum of EUR 57 500 000. This amount will be reviewed before the third year of application of the Protocol. The financial contribution to support the development of Mauritania’s sectoral fisheries policy is maintained at the overall level of the current Protocol, i.e. EUR 16 500 000 for the entire duration of the Protocol, but is spread over a period of 5 years, taking into account the rate of uptake of the funds and amounts that remain available under the current Protocol."
