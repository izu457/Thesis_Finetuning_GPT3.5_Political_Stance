(ii) the instrument for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime and crisis management (isf-p) and (iii) the drugs component of the justice programme. content: the proposal for a regulation - presented for a union of 27 member states - seeks to establish the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. the proposed scope builds largely on the current regulation for the internal security fund-police, while taking into account new policy developments, such as the european security agenda, the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime, and the new interoperability agenda. objectives : the new enhanced fund shall contribute to a high level of security in the union, in particular by tackling terrorism and radicalisation, serious organised crime and cybercrime and by assisting and protecting victims of crime. its specific objectives shall be to: increase the exchange of information among and within the union law enforcement and other competent authorities and other relevant union bodies as well as with third countries and international organisations; intensify cross-border joint operations among and within the union law enforcement and other competent authorities in relation to serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension; support effort at strengthening the capabilities in relation to combating and preventing crime including terrorism in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners across the member states. actions funded shall be implemented in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity. actions limited to maintaining public order at national level shall not be eligible. member state support : the allocation of the funding to the programmes of the member states shall be based on a distribution key of three criteria: (i) the gross domestic product; (ii) size of the territory and; (iii) population of the state. it is proposed to weigh the different criteria as follows: 45% to inverse proportion to the gross domestic product, 40% to proportion to the size of population and 15% to proportion to the size of the territory of the member state. the remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for projects with real european added value or to meet urgent needs and emergency funding to member states. coordination between eu policies : the enhanced isf shall be coherent with and complementary to other union financial programmes, notably the cohesion policy funds and horizon europe, as well as the integrated border management fund and the asylum and migration fund. furthermore, work under the internal security fund shall be consistent with that of the european union agency for law enforcement cooperation (europol), the european union agency for law enforcement training (cepol) and the european monitoring centre for drugs and drug addiction (emcdda). the commission proposes to allocate an amount of eur 1.12 billion (in current prices) to eu agencies in the field of security. the proposed regulation does not cover the funding for these agencies. proposed budget : the commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes eur 2.5 billion (in current prices) to the internal security fund for the period 2021-2027. the financial envelope shall be used as follows: eur 1.5 billion allocated to member states to enable them to build long-term resilience in the field of security; eur 1 billion allocated to the thematic mechanism to address unforeseen security challenges and to enable a rapid response to emergency situations."

support the common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel and prevent migratory and security risks: the instrument shall contribute to the improvement of the efficiency of visa processing in terms of detecting and assessing security and irregular migration risks, as well as facilitating visa procedures for bona fide travellers. in particular, the instrument shall deliver financial assistance to support digitalisation of visa processing with the objective to provide fast, secure and client-friendly visa procedures for the benefit of both visa applicants and consulates. priority shall be given to supporting actions with a european dimension. support to member states : in addition to a basic amount of eur 5 million that is envisaged to be allocated to member states at the beginning of the programming period, the financial envelope foreseen for the programmes of member states shall be allocated based on a distribution key that shall reflect the needs and pressure experienced by member states in the two areas covered by this instrument (border management and visas). funding shall be distributed based on the following weighing: 30% for external land borders, 35% for external sea borders, 20% for airports and 15% for consular offices. a mid-term review shall take into account new or additional pressures. the remaining 40 % of the overall financial envelope shall be managed through the thematic facility, which shall periodically provide funding for a number of priorities defined in commission financing decisions. the instrument shall furthermore maintain support for the functioning of the special transit scheme implemented by lithuania, in line with the eu’s obligations, compensating lithuania for the transit visa fees it foregoes and additional costs it incurs as a result of the facilitated transit document (ftd) and facilitated rail transit document (frtd) scheme, such as the costs of replacing and upgrading equipment and it systems, and training and operational costs. proposed budget : the commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework includes eur 8.01 billion (in current prices) for the instrument for border management and visa for the 2021-2027 period. implementation shall be by means of shared, direct or indirect management. the global resources shall be allocated as follows: eur 4.81 billion (around 60%) for measures taken by member states in border management and visa policy, including eur 157.2 million for the special transit scheme applied by lithuania;

committee on civil liberties, justice and home affairs adopted the report by péter niedermüller (s&d, hu) on the proposal for a regulation of the european parliament and of the council on the european union agency for asylum and repealing regulation (eu) no 439/2010. the committee recommended that the european parliament’s position adopted at first reading following the ordinary legislative procedure should amend the commission proposal as follows: strengthen the agency’s mission : the future agency shall support, facilitate, coordinate and strengthen practical cooperation, information exchange and the implementation of the common european asylum system (ceas), including fundamental rights compliance, by performing the following tasks: assist member states on training or provide training to member states' experts from all national administrations, courts and tribunals, and national services responsible for asylum matters: the main objective would be to promote best practice and the highest standards in the implementation of eu asylum legislation and to protect the needs of unaccompanied minors and vulnerable persons, integration and resettlement issues and other relevant asylum issues; assist member states with a view to guaranteeing high standards and respect of fundamental rights; deploy liaison officers in member states and, where appropriate, third countries; evaluate the implementation of the ceas, as well as the asylum and reception systems and the reception capacity of the member states; assist member states with regard to humanitarian visas; carry out resettlement missions; support member states with a view to the correct implementation of the dublin system as regards determining the responsibility of member states for asylum applications. cooperation with other organisations : in order to perform its tasks, the agency shall work in close cooperation with the unhcr, relevant intergovernmental organisations, such as the council of europe and the international organisation for migration, and relevant non-governmental organisations, researchers and academics. it shall also close collaboration with the european border and coast guard and shall take into account the risk analysis and vulnerability assessment carried out by that agency to ensure the highest level of consistency and convergence in the information provided by both agencies. all relevant information shall be sent to the european parliament. transparency, communication and cooperation : the agency and the member states' asylum authorities, national immigration and asylum services and other national services shall be subject to a duty to cooperate in good faith and an obligation to exchange all relevant information on a regular basis. where the executive director has established that a member state's asylum authorities, national immigration and asylum services and other national services have systematically failed to comply with the duty to cooperate in good faith, including the duty to provide timely and accurate information, he or she shall submit a report to the management board and to the commission and include such information in the annual activity report on the situation of asylum in the union. the agency should focus on the following key issues: the processing of applications for international protection by national administrations and authorities, including on the duration of processing of applications and on other procedural aspects; the agency shall study the differences in the recognition rates recorded by member states regarding applications for international protection from applicants of a given country of origin which is the subject of the common analysis; the root causes, migratory and refugee flows, particularly on the presence of unaccompanied minors, reception capacity and resettlement needs, as well as on any sudden arrivals of large numbers of third-country nationals which may cause disproportionate pressure on asylum and reception systems, with a view to foster quick and reliable mutual information to the member states and to identify possible risks to the member states' asylum systems; issues regarding a common eu list of safe countries. the information relating to the drawing up of this list should be forwarded to the european parliament. in this regard, it is provided that the parliament, the council or the commission may request the agency to examine the situation in one of the third countries in order to determine whether the conditions and criteria for inclusion on the safe list is still relevant; the assessment of the asylum situation in the member states: to this end, the agency will be able to carry out on-site (possibly unannounced) inspections and case sampling on the basis of information provided by the applicants and on the evaluations transmitted by the bodies and organisations with which it cooperates. providing the agency with new operational capacities : it is proposed to provide new operational capacities to the agency in the field of human resources. in order to carry out its task of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the common european asylum system and the member states’ asylum and reception systems in an effective, impartial and independent manner, the agency shall have an appropriate number of permanent and temporary staff and adequate financial resources. the task of monitoring and evaluating the ceas should not be carried out by seconded experts, but by the agency’s own staff, trained for that purpose. each member state shall contribute to the number of experts, in accordance with annex 1a. member states who do not make available the required number of experts shall instead provide a financial contribution to a platform set up at union level, contributing to addressing challenges due to disproportionate pressure and managed directly or indirectly by the agency. the agency shall inform the european parliament on an annual basis of the number of experts that each member state has committed and the number experts actually deployed from the pool. provision of reception facilities : for the purposes of organising and coordinating the operational and technical measures, the agency may enter into emergency standby agreements with the unhcr and relevant intergovernmental or non-governmental organisations to complement the agency’s capacity to provide operational and technical assistance to member states, in particular with regard to the setting up or provision of reception facilities, the provision of information to asylum seekers, identification, referral and assistance to vulnerable persons and the provision of interpretation services. deployment of migration management support teams : where a member state faces disproportionate migratory challenges at particular hotspot areas of its external borders characterised by large inward mixed migratory flows, that member state may request technical and operational reinforcement by migration management support teams. the member state shall submit a request for reinforcement and an assessment of its needs to the agency and other relevant union agencies, in particular the european border and coast guard and europol. the executive director, in coordination with other relevant union agencies, shall assess a member state's request for reinforcement and the assessment of its needs for the purpose of defining a comprehensive reinforcement package consisting of various activities coordinated by the relevant union agencies to be agreed upon by the member state concerned. during deployment of asylum support teams or experts from the asylum intervention pool, the host member state shall issue instructions to the teams in accordance with the operational plan. it is also provided that the agency deploy liaison officers in member states and, where appropriate, third countries. the tasks of the agency's liaison officers shall include, in compliance with union law and in full respect of fundamental rights, establishing and maintaining contacts with the competent authorities of the third country to which they are assigned. the decision to deploy liaison officers to third countries shall be subject to receiving the prior opinion of the commission. the european parliament shall be kept fully informed of those activities without delay. it should be noted that where experts of an asylum support team or from the asylum intervention pool are operating in a third country, the agency shall be liable for any damage caused by them during their activities. evaluations carried out by the agency : it is proposed that member states shall be monitored every three years (and not five as proposed by the commission) in particular on all aspects of the ceas. this can also be seen as a preventive measure, since deficiencies may be detected and rectified in a timely matter. the result of these assessments would also provide a clear picture on the overall functioning of ceas. besides this general assessment, it is proposed that there is a need for the possibility of an assessment/monitoring to be decided on an annual basis. such assessment is to be linked with the information analysis prepared by the agency. the annual assessment could be carried out in one or more member states, depending on the abovementioned information analysis carried out by the agency. implementation by member states of the ceas and liaison officers in member states : it is proposed that the agency initiate a monitoring exercise which would only be carried out in specific cases, where events in any of the member states give rise to serious concerns regarding the functioning of any aspects of that member states’ asylum system and may put the functioning of the ceas in jeopardy if not handled in a timely manner. the agency may decide that a liaison officer covers up to four member states which are geographically close to each other. a cooperation procedure between the agency, liaison officers and the member states is proposed in this regard. following the agency’s remarks, the commission may take measures to address the serious shortcomings observed and inform the european parliament thereof. fundamental rights : members proposed appointing a fundamental rights officer responsible for drawing up the fundamental rights strategy, monitoring compliance with fundamental rights and promoting the respect of fundamental rights by the agency. the officer shall be independent in the performance of his or her duties, and shall have access to all information concerning respect for fundamental rights, including by carrying out on-site visits to any operational activity carried out by the agency. the budget, including the establishment plan, shall include sufficient financing of the fundamental rights strategy and the fundamental rights officer amounting to at least 5 % of the overall budget. the agency shall draw up and further develop and implement a fundamental rights strategy including an effective mechanism to monitor the respect for fundamental rights in all the activities of the agency. various provisions : it is proposed to establish: a code of conduct applicable to all experts involved in support operations laying down provisions to guarantee the principles of the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights with particular focus on children, and other persons in a vulnerable situation; a compliant mechanism to monitor and ensure the respect for fundamental rights in all the activities of the agency; a prevention of conflicts of interest mechanism requiring the members of its bodies and its staff members to avoid any situation liable to give rise to a conflict of interest during their employment or term of office and to report such situations."

and - allow for a derogation from the normal co-financing rules currently applicable in order to allow for the necessary flexibility to mobilise existing investment resources to address the direct and indirect effects stemming from the unprecedented public health crisis in the context of the covid-19 pandemic. specifically, it is proposed to amend regulation (eu) no 1303/2013 and regulation (eu) no 223/2014 in order to: - ensure that member states and regions may continue to benefit from a 100% eu co-financing rate for the accounting year 2021-2022 and this by way of notification to the commission; - introduce arrangements for the budgetary execution of additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate to take account of annual ceilings for payments; - introduce additional flexibility between erdf and esf specifically for operations addressing the migratory challenges as a result of the military aggression by russia and introduce simplified reporting arrangements on participants with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 february 2022 (date of the start of the military aggression); - introduce flexibility for member states to amend programmes supported by the fead and this by way of notification to the commission and also with a retroactive start date of eligibility of support set at 24 february 2022. budgetary implications the proposed modification does not require changes in the multiannual financial framework annual ceilings for commitments and payments and does not imply changes to the overall payment needs over the 2021-2027 period. based on the previous uptake of the 100% co-financing rate in the 2020-2021 accounting year, the level of payment applications submitted in the second half of 2021, and the latest member state payment forecasts for 2022, the budgetary impact of the application of the 100% co-financing rate for the 2021-2022 accounting year is estimated to represent a frontloading of payment needs of eur 9 billion to 2022 and eur 1 billion to 2023, compensated by a corresponding reduction of eur 10 billion in 2024. however, in order to be able to comply with the payment ceilings in years 2022 and 2023, it is proposed to cap the total additional payments resulting from the application of the 100% co-financing rate at eur 5 billion in 2022 and eur 1 billion in 2023. the additional amounts will only be paid after all the payment applications are received for the accounting year 2021-2022."

to conclude the agreement between the european union and the republic of colombia on the short-stay visa waiver. proposed act: council decision. role of the european parliament: council may adopt the act only if parliament has given its consent to the act. background: regulation (eu) no 509/2014 of the european parliament and of the council amended regulation (ec) no 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of the member states and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. the regulation was adopted on 20 may 2014 and entered into force on 9 june 2014. regulation (eu) no 509/2014 transferred 19 countries to annex ii, which lists the third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement. those 19 countries are: colombia, dominica, grenada, kiribati, marshall islands, micronesia, nauru, palau, peru, saint lucia, saint vincent and the grenadines, samoa, solomon islands, timor-leste, tonga, trinidad and tobago, tuvalu, the united arab emirates and vanuatu. colombia and peru were, according to recital 5 of regulation (eu) no 509/2014 and the joint declaration issued at the time of adoption, subject to a specific procedure which required a further assessment of those countries against the relevant criteria, before the commission could present to the council recommendations for decisions authorising the opening of negotiations on visa waiver agreements with those two countries. in october 2014, the commission adopted a report broadly assessing the situation of colombia. the commission concluded that the significant improvement of the colombian economic and social situation in recent years provided justification that colombians should be granted visa-free access to the member states' territory. in addition, the visa waiver agreement contains the necessary safeguards to suspend or terminate the agreement should this be required to avoid security or migration risks for the union. in march 2015, the commission presented a recommendation to the council to authorise it to start negotiations on visa waiver agreements with colombia and peru. on 19 may 2015, the council addressed negotiating directives to the commission. the negotiations with colombia were opened on 20 may 2015 in brussels. the agreement was initialled by the chief negotiators on 9 june 2015. the commission considered that the objectives set by the council in its negotiating directives were attained and that the draft visa waiver agreement is acceptable to the union. content: the commission proposes that the council approve the agreement between the european union and colombia on the short-stay visa waiver. the content of the agreement may be summarised as follows: purpose and duration of stay: the agreement provides for visa-free travel for the citizens of the european union and for the citizens of colombia when travelling to the territory of the other contracting party for a maximum period of 90 days in any 180-day period. in order to safeguard equal treatment of all eu citizens, a provision has been included in the agreement stating that colombia may suspend or terminate the agreement only in respect of all the member states of the european union and that the union may also only suspend or terminate the agreement in respect of all of its member states. the agreement takes into account the situation of the member states that do not yet apply the schengen acquis in full. as long as they are not part of the schengen area without internal borders, the visa waiver confers a right for the nationals of colombia to stay for 90 days in any 180-day on the territory of each of those member states (currently bulgaria, croatia, cyprus and romania), independently of the period calculated for the whole schengen area. scope: the visa waiver covers all categories of persons (ordinary, diplomatic, service/official and special passport holders) travelling for all kinds of purposes, except for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. for this latter category, each member state and also colombia remain free to impose the visa requirement on the citizens of the other party in accordance with the applicable union or national law. in order to ensure harmonised implementation, a joint declaration is attached to the agreement on the interpretation of the category of persons travelling for the purpose of carrying out a paid activity. biometric passports: the agreement includes a number of declarations: territorial application: in the case of france and the netherlands, the visa waiver would entitle nationals of colombia to stay only in those member states’ european territories. the provisions of the agreement do not apply to the united kingdom and ireland. the agreement establishes a joint committee for the management of the agreement, which shall adopt its rules of procedure."

european parliament: the european parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the council. background: in 2016, the commission carried out a comprehensive evaluation of sis, three years after the entry into operation of its second generation. this evaluation showed that sis has been a genuine operational success. nonetheless, the effectiveness and efficiency of the system should be further strengthened. to this end, the commission is presenting a first set of three proposals to improve and extend the use of sis as result of the evaluation while continuing its work to make existing and future law enforcement and border management systems more interoperable. these proposals cover the use of the system for: border management , police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and the return of illegally staying third country nationals. content: the present proposal and the supplementary proposal on the use of the sis for police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters lay down rules covering the comprehensive end-to-end use of sis, including the central sis managed by eu-lisa agency, but also the needs of the end-user. end-to-end use of sis : with over 2 million end-users in the competent authorities across europe, sis is an extremely widely used and effective tool for information exchange. this proposal as well as the parallel proposals include rules covering the complete end-to-end operation of the system, including central sis operated by eu-lisa, the national systems and the end-user applications. it addresses not only the central and national systems themselves, but also the end-users' technical and operational needs. in order to use sis to its full effectiveness member states should ensure that each time their end-users are entitled to carry out a search in a national police or immigration database, they also search sis in parallel. this way sis can fulfil its objective as the main compensatory measure in the area without internal border controls and member states can better address the cross-border dimension of criminality and the mobility of criminals. data quality : the proposal maintains the principle that the member state, which is the data owner, is also responsible for the accuracy of the data entered in sis. it is, however, necessary to provide for a central mechanism managed by eu-lisa which allows member states to regularly review those alerts in which the mandatory data fields may raise quality concerns. the proposal empowers eu-lisa to produce data quality reports to member states at regular intervals. photographs, facial images, dactylographic data and dna profiles : the possibility to search with fingerprints with a view to identify a person is already set out in existing regulation. two new proposals make this search mandatory if the identity of the person cannot be ascertained in any other way. currently, facial images can only be used to confirm a person's identity following an alphanumeric search, rather than as the basis for a search. furthermore, changes make provision for facial images, photographs and palm prints to be used to search the system and identify people, when this becomes technically possible. dactylography refers to the scientific study of fingerprints as a method of identification. palm prints can be used to establish a person's identity in the same way that fingerprints can be used. the use of facial images for identification will ensure greater consistency between sis and the proposed eu entry exit system, electronic gates and self-service kiosks. this functionality will be limited to the regular border crossing points. access by authorities to sis – institutional users : this section is intended to describe the new elements in access rights with regard to eu agencies (institutional users). appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure that the data in the system is properly protected (including the provisions requiring that these bodies may only access the data they need to carry out their tasks). the access rights of competent national authorities have not been amended. refusal of entry and stay : currently, a member state may insert an alert in sis in respect of persons subject to an entry ban based on a failure to comply with national migration legislation. with the new proposal, it shall be required that an alert be entered in sis in any case in which an entry ban has been issued to an illegally staying third country national (this provision is inserted in order to avoid that entry bans are visible in sis while the third-country national concerned is still present on the eu territory). this proposal is closely linked with the commission proposal concerning the use of sis for the return of illegally staying third country nationals. in order to allow entering such alerts it was necessary to require the minimum data necessary for the identification of the person, namely surname and date of birth which was not obligatory in the former legislation. data protection and security : the proposal clarifies responsibility for preventing, reporting and responding to incidents that might affect the security or integrity of sis infrastructure, sis data or supplementary information. it provides that the commission remains responsible for the contractual management of the sis communication infrastructure, including tasks which will be transferred to eu-lisa. categories of data and data processing : in order to provide more and more precise information to the end-users to facilitate and accelerate the required action as well as to allow the better identification of the alert subject this proposal expands the types of information that can be held about people for whom an alert has been issued. the proposal also expands the list of personal data that may be entered and processed in sis for the purpose of dealing with misused identities as more data facilitates the victim and the perpetrator of misused identity. the extension of this provision entails no risk as all these data can only be entered upon the consent of the victim of misused identity. this will now also include: facial images; palm prints; details of identity documents; the victim's address; the names of the victim's father and mother. the proposal sets out the rights for data subjects to access data, rectify inaccurate data and erase unlawfully stored data. lastly, provisions are laid down as regards statistics on the use of the sis. budgetary implications: the estimated cost is eur 64.3 million from 2018-2020."

to reform the schengen information system (sis) in order to enhance the general provisions regarding police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, amending regulation (eu) no 515/2014 and repealing regulation (ec) no 1986/2006, council decision 2007/533/jha and commission decision 2010/261/eu. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. role of the european parliament: the european parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the council. background: in 2016, the commission carried out a comprehensive evaluation of sis, three years after the entry into operation of its second generation. this evaluation showed that sis has been a genuine operational success. nonetheless, the effectiveness and efficiency of the system should be further strengthened. to this end, the commission is presenting a first set of three proposals to improve and extend the use of sis as result of the evaluation while continuing its work to make existing and future law enforcement and border management systems more interoperable. these proposals cover the use of the system for: border management, police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters , and the return of illegally staying third country nationals. content: the present proposal and the supplementary proposal on border management lay down rules covering the comprehensive end-to-end use of sis, including the central sis managed by eu-lisa agency, but also the needs of the end-user. end-to-end use of sis : with over 2 million end-users in the competent authorities across europe, sis is an extremely widely used and effective tool for information exchange. this proposal as well as the parallel proposal on border management include rules covering the complete end-to-end operation of the system, including central sis operated by eu-lisa, the national systems and the end-user applications. it addresses not only the central and national systems themselves, but also the end-users' technical and operational needs. in order to use sis to its full effectiveness member states should ensure that each time their end-users are entitled to carry out a search in a national police or immigration database, they also search sis in parallel. this way sis can fulfil its objective as the main compensatory measure in the area without internal border controls and member states can better address the cross-border dimension of criminality and the mobility of criminals. data quality : the proposal maintains the principle that the member state, which is the data owner, is also responsible for the accuracy of the data entered in sis. it is, however, necessary to provide for a central mechanism managed by eu-lisa which allows member states to regularly review those alerts in which the mandatory data fields may raise quality concerns. the proposal empowers eu-lisa to produce data quality reports to member states at regular intervals. photographs, facial images, dactylographic data and dna profiles : the possibility to search with fingerprints with a view to identify a person is already set out in existing regulation. two new proposals make this search mandatory if the identity of the person cannot be ascertained in any other way. currently, facial images can only be used to confirm a person's identity following an alphanumeric search, rather than as the basis for a search. furthermore, changes make provision for facial images, photographs and palm prints to be used to search the system and identify people, when this becomes technically possible. dactylography refers to the scientific study of fingerprints as a method of identification. palm prints can be used to establish a person's identity in the same way that fingerprints can be used. in cases where fingerprints or palm prints are not available, the proposal allows for the use of dna profiles for missing persons who need to be placed under protection, especially children. this functionality will be used only in the absence of fingerprints and will be accessible only to authorised users. the proposed changes will also allow sis alerts to be issued for unknown persons wanted in connection with a crime, based on fingerprints or palm prints. this new alert category complements the prüm provisions that enable interconnectivity of national criminal fingerprint identification systems. via the prüm mechanism, a member state can launch a request to ascertain if the perpetrator of a crime whose fingerprints have been found is known in any other member state (usually for investigative purposes). a person can be identified via the prüm mechanism only if he or she has been fingerprinted in another member state for criminal purposes. hence, first time offenders cannot be identified. under this proposal, the storage of fingerprints of unknown wanted persons, will enable the fingerprints of an unknown perpetrator to be uploaded into sis so that he or she can be identified as wanted if encountered in another member state. it should be noted that the use of this functionality presupposes that the member states conducted a prior consultation of all available national and international sources but could not ascertain the identity of the person concerned. access to sis by immigration authorities – institutional users : users such as europol, eurojust and the european border and coast guard agency shall have access to sis and sis data that they need. appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure that the data in the system is properly protected requiring that these bodies may only access the data they need to carry out their tasks. provisions are also laid down enabling immigration authorities to access sis. suspension of certain alerts : the proposal provides for member states to temporarily suspend alerts for arrest (in case of an ongoing police operation or investigation), making them visible only to sirene bureaux but not to the officers on the ground for a limited period of time. this provision helps to avoid that a confidential police operation to arrest a highly wanted offender is jeopardised by a police officer who is not involved in the matter. provisions are laid down for alerts on missing persons. changes to these allow preventive alerts to be issued in cases where parental abduction is deemed a high risk, and provide for more finely tuned categorisation of missing persons alerts. these changes will mean that, where there is a high risk of imminent parental abduction, border guards and law enforcement officials are made aware of the risk and will be able to examine more closely the circumstances where an at-risk child is travelling, taking the child into protective custody if required. this alert will require an appropriate decision of the judicial authorities granting custody only to one of the parents. inquiry check : the proposal introduces a new form of check, the 'inquiry check'. this is, in particular, intended to support measures to counter terrorism and serious crime. it allows authorities to stop and question the person concerned. it is more in-depth than the existing discreet check, but does not involve searching the person and does not amount to arresting him or her. it may, however, provide sufficient information to decide on further action to be taken. an expanded list of objects is set out for which alerts can be issued, adding falsified documents, falsified banknotes, it equipment, component parts of vehicles, etc. data protection and security : the proposal clarifies responsibility for preventing, reporting and responding to incidents that might affect the security or integrity of sis infrastructure, sis data or supplementary information. it provides that the commission remains responsible for the contractual management of the sis communication infrastructure, including tasks which will be transferred to eu-lisa. categories of data and data processing : in order to provide more and more precise information to the end-users to facilitate and accelerate the required action as well as to allow the better identification of the alert subject, this proposal expands the types of information that can be held about people for whom an alert has been issued. the proposal also expands the list of personal data that may be entered and processed in sis for the purpose of dealing with misused identities as more data facilitates the victim and the perpetrator of misused identity. the extension of this provision entails no risk as all these data can only be entered upon the consent of the victim of misused identity. this will now also include: facial images; palm prints; details of identity documents; the victim's address; the names of the victim's father and mother. the proposal sets out the rights for data subjects to access data, rectify inaccurate data and erase unlawfully

border management systems more interoperable. these proposals cover the use of the system for: border management, police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and the return of illegally staying third country nationals . content: this proposal lays down the conditions and procedures for the entry and processing in the schengen information system (sis) of alerts in respect of third-country nationals subject to return decisions issued by the member states in accordance with procedures respecting directive 2008/115/ec, as well as for exchanging supplementary information on such alerts. purpose : the purpose of the present proposal is to improve and extend the use of sis by making it obligatory for member states' authorities to enter in sis all return decisions issued, to allow their eu-wide visibility and thus enhance their enforcement. the use of sis for return is aimed at assisting immigration authorities in following up and enforcing the return of third-country nationals who have no right to stay in the member states. it also helps to prevent and deter irregular migration and to enhance information sharing and cooperation between immigration authorities. entering alerts on return : in order to facilitate the exchange of information between competent authorities, the proposal lays down the purpose and rules for entering alerts on return in sis to allow the competent authorities to verify that the obligation to return has been complied with. the alert should be without delay entered as soon as the decision has been issued to the illegally staying third-country national concerned, in order to allow the verification referred to above. the alert should indicate if a period for voluntary departure is still running or if a decision has been suspended or removal has been postponed. where there are no reasons to believe that it would undermine the purpose of return procedures, voluntary return should be preferred over forced return and a period for voluntary departure should be granted to the returnee. the duration of the period for voluntary departure, and any prolongation thereof, should be indicated in the alert to allow public authorities to decide whether it is appropriate to take action in the individual case. exchange of information between the competent authorities : the proposal lays down ca tegories of data that can be contained in a return alert. effective and timely cooperation and exchange of supplementary information between member states requires the set-up of single point of contact. to improve the efficiency of the eu's return policy, member states shall be obliged to confirm the departure of the third-country national subject to an alert on return to the member state (or authority) that entered the alert. this provision shall allow the authorities issuing and enforcing return decisions to verify that the obligation to return has been complied with. non-compliance with an obligation to return : the proposal sets out the provisions in cases of non-compliance with the obligation to return. a series of procedures are provided to deal with situations where a third-country national subject to an alert on return is identified and apprehended in another member state (passing back the third-country national to the issuing member state). access and management of data : provisions are provided regarding: alerts on return need to be deleted following the return of the third-country national concerned; the opportunity to keep trace in sis of return decisions after the return was enforced will be explored. this information could be useful if a third country national re-entered the territory of the member states and is found as illegally staying in a different member state than the one who issued the first return decision; enabling the authorities responsible for issuing return decisions to be able to access sis in order to enter, update, delete and search data (the authorities concerned are listed in the proposal). budgetary implications: the cost-estimate of eur 3.6 million from 2018 to 2020 includes costs for the technical upgrade of sis for the purpose of return."

to conclude an agreement between the european union and the kingdom of norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the internal security fund for the period 2014 to 2020. proposed act: council decision. role of the european parliament: council may adopt the act only if parliament has given its consent to the act. background: regulation (eu) no 515/2014 of the european parliament and of the council establishing, as part of the internal security fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa became applicable as of 1 january 2014. furthermore, regulation (eu) no 514/2014 of the european parliament and of the council laying down general provisions on the asylum, migration and integration fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management also became applicable on the same date. under this regulation, the provisions of the regulation (eu) no 514/2014 apply to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa as part of the internal security fund (the isf-borders and visa). the purpose of the isf-borders and visa is to establish a solidarity mechanism binding the participating states by the same european rules on the control of external borders in each other's interests and on each other's behalf. the isf-borders and visa will serve to accomplish a key objective of the schengen acquis, namely to share responsibility for an 'efficient, high and uniform level of control at the external borders'. it is thus a development of the schengen acquis. article 5(7) of regulation (eu) no 515/2014 provides that the countries associated with the implementation, application and development of the schengen acquis participate in the instrument in accordance with its provisions and that arrangements are to be concluded on their financial contributions and the supplementary rules necessary for such participation, including provisions ensuring the protection of the union's financial interests and the power of audit of the court of auditors, as the respective association agreements do not provide for such rules. the aim of the draft agreement with norway is to establish the arrangements of this participation and to enable the commission to assume ultimate responsibility for implementation of the budget of the instrument in this associated country and determine this country's contribution to the union budget in respect of this instrument. content: under this proposal, it is proposed that the council adopt the decision in which it is called upon to conclude, on behalf of the european union, the agreement between the european union and the kingdom of norway on supplementary rules in relation to the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa, as part of the internal security fund, for the period 2014 to 2020. rules for the participation of norway in the isf-borders and visas: the agreement provides for a number of technical provisions to establish the framework for participation. the funds allocated to norway under the isf-borders and visa shall be used in accordance with the principle of sound financial management. protection of the financial interests of the union against fraud is also stressed. budgetary control: provisions are laid down as regards budgetary and financial controls. member states shall be subject to horizontal obligations (e.g. the competence of the court of auditors and of the european anti-fraud office (olaf)) derived either directly from the treaty or from secondary union legislation. moreover, the court of auditors and olaf shall be granted suitable access to carry out controls. financial contributions from norway to the isf: provisions are also provided to guarantee the payments of the contribution from norway to the isf for the implementation of eu actions and its mid-term review and other specific actions. for the years 2016 to 2018, norway shall make annual payments to the budget of the isf-borders and visa in the order of eur 19 777 712. territorial application: regulation (eu) no 515/2014 constitutes a development of the schengen acquis. in this regard, the present agreement with norway also builds on the schengen acquis. denmark shall not take part in the adoption of this decision and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application. the same goes for the united kingdom and ireland."

closer coordination both at network management and at regional operational level of immigration liaison officers deployed by member states, the commission and union agencies. in order to strengthen the governance of a european network of ilos, the proposal: further clarifies the definition of immigration liaison officer, making an explicit reference to law enforcement liaison officers working on immigration-related tasks; introduces a steering board at the european level to strengthen among member states, the commission and the union agencies the network management and coordination of immigration liaison officers deployed to third countries; introduces reporting requirements to be agreed by the steering board, which will include follow-up actions, and also introduces the possibility for the steering board to commission ad-hoc targeted information requests; reinforces information exchange between immigration liaison officers as well as members of the steering board via a secured web-based platform; provides legal certainty as to processing of personal data by immigration liaison officers for the purpose of fulfilling tasks and activities defined by the proposal. budgetary implication: the total cost of implementing the proposal is estimated at eur 17.3 million over a nine-year period starting in 2019, of which eur 1.6 million to support the functioning of the steering board, eur 12 million for the implementation of the activities of a european network of ilos and eur 3.5 million estimated for the deployment of the immigration liaison officers by the commission. if the proposal is adopted before the next financial framework, the necessary resources (estimated at eur 860 000) shall be financed from the current isf borders and visas budget line and the amounts shall be deducted from the total allocation of eur 17.3 million for the implementation of this proposal."

unfounded asylum applications from the nationals of that third country, where such increase is leading to specific pressures on the member state’s asylum system; rejected readmission applications submitted by the member state to that third country for its own nationals. the commission may decide that action is needed, taking into account the consequences of the suspension of the visa exemption for the external relations of the union and its member states with the third country concerned, while working in close cooperation with that third country to find alternative long-term solutions. in that case, the commission has three months from the receipt of the notification to adopt an implementing act temporarily suspending the exemption from the visa requirement for the nationals of the third country concerned, for a period of six months. before the expiry of this six-month period, the commission must submit a report to the european parliament and the council. this report may be accompanied by a legislative proposal to amend regulation (ec) no 539/2001 to transfer the third country in question to the list of visa-required countries (annex i), and thus to put its citizens permanently under the visa requirement. in such case, the temporary suspension of the visa waiver may be extended by a maximum period of 12 months. migration crisis : in the context of the current migratory situation in the european union and of the successful conclusion of several visa liberalisation dialogues with neighbouring countries (georgia, ukraine, kosovo, turkey), several member states have questioned whether the existing visa suspension mechanism provides for the necessary flexibility to act in certain situations of urgency. in particular they have argued that: the possible grounds for suspension are too limited, and for instance do not include the failure of a third country to cooperate on readmission of third-country nationals having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the union or a member state and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation; the initiative to trigger the suspension mechanism by means of a notification, which in the regulation lies solely with member states, should be extended to commission; the reference periods and the deadlines are too long, which does not allow for a fast reaction in emergency situations. taking into account the commission's recent proposals for visa liberalisation of georgia, ukraine, turkey and kosovo and the recent discussions with member states, the commission has decided to present a proposal to amend regulation (ec) no 539/2001 to revise the current suspension mechanism. this is the aim of this proposal. content: the main objective is to strengthen the suspension mechanism by making it easier for member states to notify circumstances leading to a possible suspension and by enabling the commission to trigger the mechanism on its own initiative. this proposal for the revision of the suspension mechanism includes the following elements: the definition of the circumstances which member states can notify to the commission has been amended to clarify that the suspension mechanism cannot only be used in ""emergency situations, as a last resort"", but more generally in case the visa liberalisation leads to a serious increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications. the reference period for comparing this situation with the situation of the previous year or before visa liberalisation, is shortened from six to two months. it is sufficient for the increase of irregular migration, unfounded asylum applications or rejected readmission applications to be ""substantial"", whereas the increase must currently be ""sudden and substantial"". the grounds for possible suspension which can be notified should include rejected readmission applications for nationals of another third country having transited through that third country, where a readmission agreement concluded between the union or a member state and the third country concerned provides for such a readmission obligation. other salient issues : - the limitation in time (to seven years) of the possibility to compare the current situation with the situation before visa liberalisation is abolished; - the commission is given the possibility to trigger the suspension mechanism on its own initiative if it has concrete and reliable information of any of the circumstances which member states can notify or that the third country is – in a more general manner – not cooperating on readmission, in particular where an eu-level readmission agreement has been concluded with that third country. this failure to cooperate can, for instance, consist in: (i) rejecting or not replying to readmission applications, (ii) failing to issue travel documents for the purposes of return within deadlines specified in the agreement or not accepting european travel documents issued following the lapse of deadlines specified in the agreement, (iii) terminating or suspending the agreement. – where the commission, after having examined the circumstances notified (or of which it has received concrete and reliable information), decides that action is needed, the deadline for the adoption of the implementing act temporarily suspending the visa exemption for the third country concerned is reduced from three to one month. territorial provisions : the proposed regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the schengen acquis. therefore, the united kingdom and ireland shall not participate in the adoption of the regulation, nor shall it be bound or subject to its application. the amended regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in the member states in accordance with the treaties."

canada political ties and cooperation on foreign and security issues, and to advance cooperation on a large number of policy areas besides trade and economics. the agreement enshrines eu-canada common democratic values and will advance cooperation on a bilateral and multilateral level. the spa will strengthen political dialogue in fields such as: it reaffirms the parties' commitment to safeguarding international peace and security by preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and undertaking measures to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. institutional cooperation: the spa provides the mechanism for conducting political dialogue by organising annual summits at leaders level and consultations at ministerial level. it also establishes a joint ministerial committee, which replaces the previous transatlantic dialogue, and a joint cooperation committee with the objective of monitoring the development of the strategic relationship between the parties. suspension mechanism: the agreement provides for the possibility of suspending its application in case of a violation of essential elements of the agreement such as human rights and non-proliferation. in addition, the parties recognise that a particularly serious and substantial violation of human rights or non-proliferation could also serve as grounds for the termination of the comprehensive economic and trade agreement (ceta). the spa, in conjunction with the ceta, is expected to provide tangible benefits and opportunities to the citizens of the eu and canada."

israel and tunisia, third countries associated to horizon 2020; egypt, lebanon and morocco (third countries not associated to horizon 2020). with 180 million people who are considered 'water poor' , the mediterranean area is generally characterised by high levels of hydric stress. climate change is increasingly causing severe water shortages in the area, with major impacts on agriculture. such shortages result in decreasing and irregular crop yields, putting additional pressure on natural resources and on the capacity to provide clean water and affordable food for the region’s inhabitants. the programme’s strategic objective is to develop the common innovative solutions for water provision and food systems that the mediterranean region urgently needs. the programme is in line with the communication from the commission on establishing a new partnership framework with third countries under the european agenda on migration. impact assessment: the option withheld is option 2: prima joint programme based on article 185 tfeu which enables the eu to make provisions for its participation in research and development programmes run by several member states, including its participation in the structures created for the implementation of those programmes. previous and ongoing article 185 tfeu initiatives show that such an initiative is likely to have a high leverage effect on national public funds in a stable, long-term and integrated manner. content: the draft decision provides for the participation of the eu in the partnership for research and innovation in the mediterranean area ('prima') jointly undertaken by cyprus, czech republic, france, greece, israel, italy, luxembourg, malta, portugal, spain and tunisia. egypt, lebanon and morocco shall become participating states subject to the conclusion of international agreements with the union setting out the terms and conditions of their participation in prima. any member state and any country associated to horizon 2020 may participate in prima provided they contribute to its financing. objectives : the general objective of prima is to develop the fully piloted and demonstrated common innovative solutions for water provision and food systems in the mediterranean region, to make them more climate resilient, efficient, cost-effective and sustainable, and to contribute to solving nutrition, health, well-being and migration problems upstream. in order to contribute to the general objective, prima shall fulfil the following specific objectives: the formulation of a stable, long-term, common strategic agenda in the area of water provision and food systems; the orientation of all national r&i programmes towards the implementation of the strategic agenda; the structural involvement of all relevant public and private sector actors in implementing the strategic agenda by pooling knowledge and financial resources to achieve the necessary critical mass; the strengthening of funding and of the implementation capabilities of all actors involved. implementation : in order to ensure the joint implementation of prima, an implementation structure should be set up ('prima-is'). the prima-is should be the recipient of the union’s financial contribution and it should ensure the efficient implementation of prima. prima activities should be in line with the objectives and research and innovation priorities of horizon 2020 and with the general principles and conditions laid down in the regulation establishing the 2020 horizon framework programme. in order to achieve the objectives of prima, the prima-is should provide financial support mainly in the form of grants to participants in actions funded by the primais. those actions should be selected following open and competitive calls for proposals under the responsibility of the prima-is. the prima annual work plans (awp), which is subject to the approval of the commission, will ensure consistency and coordination between all activities and their orientation towards the achievement of the operational, specific and general objectives of prima. the proposal contains provisions on the monitoring, evaluation and reporting arrangements of the initiative. budgetary implications: the eu contribution shall be up to eur 200 million (in current prices) including the efta contribution. the eu contribution shall be made as part of the implementation of horizon 2020. the participating states shall make or arrange for their national funding bodies to make financial or in kind contributions of at least eur 200 000 000 during the period from the date of entry into force of this decision until 31 december 2028."

to lay down the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing. proposed act: directive of the european parliament and of the council (recast of directives 2005/71/ec and 2004/114/ec). role of the european parliament: the european parliament decides in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure and on an equal footing with the council. background: the european union’s working age population has practically stopped growing and over the next couple of years it will start shrinking. the eu is also facing a situation of 'innovation emergency'. europe is spending 0.8% of gdp less than the us and 1.5% less than japan every year on research & development (r&d). in addition, thousands of the best researchers and innovators have moved to countries where conditions are more favorable. to counterbalance this lack of manpower, immigration from outside the eu is one source of highly skilled people, and third-country national students and researchers in particular are groups which are increasingly sought after and which the eu needs to actively attract. allowing third-country nationals to acquire skills and knowledge through a period of training in europe encourages “brain circulation” and supports cooperation with third countries. however, in the absence of a clear legal framework, there is also a risk of exploitation to which trainees and au-pairs are particularly exposed, with the subsequent risk of unfair competition on the labour market. with a view to better optimising those benefits and properly tackling those risks, and taking account of the similarities of the challenges faced by these categories of migrants, this proposal amends council directive 2004/114/ec (“students’ directive”) on the conditions of admission of third country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service: extending its scope to remunerated trainees and au-pairs and making mandatory provisions on unremunerated trainees that are currently discretionary, as well as council directive 2005/71/ec on a specific procedure for admitting third-country nationals for the purposes of scientific research (“researchers’ directive”). the proposal seeks to remedy the shortcomings highlighted in the implementation reports of the two directives [see com(2011)901 and 587] on the conditions of admissions in particular (visas, mobility aspects…) and procedural safeguards. impact assessment: the following options were considered: option 1 (baseline): the member states would continue to apply different and diverging rules with respect to admission conditions (e.g. the granting of visas); option 2: increased communication efforts (in particular in case of researchers), and strengthened enforcement of the current rules; option 3: improvement of admission conditions, rights and procedural guarantees whereby member states would be obliged to (i) grant the requisite visas to the third-country national (students and other categories) who has submitted an application and (ii) introduce a compulsory deadline for decisions on an application (60 days); (iii) provide for the right of students to work during their period of study for a minimum of 15 hours per week; option 4: further improvement of admission conditions, rights also on intra-eu mobility and procedural guarantees: (i) access to job-seeking following completion of studies or research project; (ii) extended scope to au-pairs and remunerated trainees; (iii) possibility to issue long-stay visas or residence permits; (iv) increased intra-eu mobility for researchers, students and remunerated trainees; (v) specific, more favorable rules applicable to beneficiaries of eu programmes (e.g. erasmus mundus or marie curie); (vi) right of students to work for a minimum of 20 hours per week as of the first year of residence ; (vii) after finalization of their studies/research, students and researchers would be allowed to stay on the territory to identify work opportunities for a period of 12 months; (viii) decisions on applications within 60 days (all groups), and within 30 days for erasmus mundus and marie curie fellows. option 4 appears to be the most cost-effective option to meet the key objectives and brings about positive economic and social impacts. the main disadvantage of legislative changes would be the costs involved: member states would have to make modifications to their legislative frameworks. legal basis: article 79(2) points (a) and (b) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: the proposal’s overall objective is to support social, cultural and economic relationships between the eu and third countries, foster the transfer of skills and know-how and promote competitiveness while, at the same time, provide for safeguards ensuring fair treatment of these groups of third-country nationals. chapter i – general provisions: the proposal has two specific objectives: to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals to the territory of the member states for a period exceeding three months for the purposes of research, studies, pupil exchange, remunerated and unremunerated training, voluntary service and au pairing; to set out the conditions of entry and residence of third-country national students and remunerated trainees in member states other than the member state which first grants the third-country national an authorisation. scope: the proposal extends the scope of the “student” directive to include remunerated trainees and au-pairs. the proposal would not, however, apply to third-country nationals who are eu long-term residents given their more privileged status and their specific type of residence permit, or refugees, those residing in a member state on a strictly temporary basis in accordance with union legislation. member states may grant more favourable conditions for the persons to whom the proposal for directive applies, however only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern family members of researchers, rights to equal treatment, economic activities and procedural safeguards. chapter ii – admission: general principle: an applicant who satisfies all the general and specific conditions for admission shall be granted a residence permit or a long-stay visa by the member state where the application has been made. the proposal lays down the general conditions that applicants must fulfil in order to be admitted to a member state, besides the specific conditions that apply to the different categories of third-country nationals laid down in the proposal. the general conditions are very much in line with those developed in the existing acquis on legal migration, and include valid documents, sickness insurance and minimum resources. specific conditions: - the specific conditions of admission for researchers which already exist in the researchers' directive are maintained. the proposal lists the elements that should be contained in the hosting agreement: title and purpose of the research project, the confirmation of the organisation that it is hosting the researcher so that he or she can complete the research project, the start and end date of the research project, etc. for researchers to be aware of research organisations that can enter into hosting agreements, emphasis is placed in the proposal on the need for the list of approved organisation to be publicly available and up-dated regularly; - for students, the specific conditions are those in the “students’ directive”; - for pupils, remunerated and unremunerated trainees, volunteers and au-pairs, the specific conditions are that these persons are required to show evidence of the organisation that is responsible for their exchange, training or, volunteering. for au-pairs: in addition, there needs to be evidence that the host family accepts responsibility for example as far as subsistence and accommodation are concerned. the au-pair stay also needs to be based on an agreement between the au-pair and the host family defining his/her rights and obligations; for remunerated trainees, the training programme, its duration, conditions of supervision and working conditions need to be specified. in order to avoid situations in which trainees are used as 'cheap labour', the host entity may be obliged to declare that the third-country national is not filling a job. chapter iii – authorisations and duration of residence: a series of provisions set out the information that should be included on the third-country national's residence permit or long-term visa. for researchers and students an authorisation should be granted for at least one year. for all other groups, the authorisation is limited to one year as a rule, with the possibility for exceptions. chapter iv – grounds for refusal, withdrawal or non-renewal of authorisations: the provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusing, withdrawing or not renewing an authorisation, such as the general and specific conditions for admission no longer being met, false documents etc., which are standard conditions under the existing migration directives. chapter v – rights: to ensure the fair treatment of third-country nationals falling under the scope of the directive, a new provision entitles them to equal treatment under the single permit directive. more favourable rights to equal treatment with nationals of the host member state as regards branches of social security as defined in regulation no 883/2004 on the coordination of social security schemes are maintained for third-country national researchers, without the possibility for the limitations laid down by the single permit directive. furthermore, school pupils, volunteers, unremunerated trainees and au-pairs will benefit from equal treatment rights with nationals of the host member state as regards access to goods and services and the supply of goods and services made available to the public independently on whether union or national law gives them access to the labour market. right to work: provisions exist in the proposal whereby researchers and students are given the right to work , with member states being able to set certain limits. researchers, as was the case under directive 2005/71, are allowed to teach in accordance with national legislation. regarding students, whereas under directive 2004/114/ec students were allowed to work for a minimum of 10 hours per week, this period has been increased to 20 hours. with respect to students' access to economic activities, member states may continue take into consideration their labour market situation but this should be done in a proportionate way in order not to systematically endanger the right to work. the proposal introduces the possibility for students and researchers, if they fulfil the general admission conditions of the proposal (except for the condition on being a minor), to stay in the member state for 12 months upon finalisation of their studies/research in order to look for work or set up a business. this provision has the potential to make the member states more competitive in the search for talents on a global stage. it would however not be an automatic work permit. in a period of more than 3 and less than 6 months, member states could ask the third-country nationals to provide documentation that they are genuinely seeking for a job (for example, copies of the letters and cvs sent to employers) or are in the process of setting up a business. after 6 months, they could also ask third- country nationals to provide evidence that they have a genuine chance of being engaged or of launching a business. the proposal includes specific provisions on the admission and access to the labour market of researchers' family members in derogation to directive 2003/86/ec with a view to increasing the eu’s attractiveness to third-country national researchers. chapter vi – mobility between member states: a series of articles set out the conditions under which researchers, students and trainees can move between the member states, in order to facilitate such mobility: for researchers , under directive 2005/71/ec, the period for which they are allowed to move to a second member state on the basis of the hosting agreement concluded in the first member state has been extended from 3 to 6 months (n.b. in line with the provisions of the blue card directive, researchers' family members can move between member states together with the researcher). for students , provisions would also allow them to move to a second member state for a period of up to 6 months on the basis of the authorisation granted by the first member state . specific rules apply to third country nationals who come under eu mobility programmes, for example the current erasmus mundus or marie curie programmes, in order to simplify the exercise of mobility. chapter vii – procedure and transparency: the proposal introduces a time-limit that obliges member states to decide on the complete application for an authorisation and notify the applicant in writing within 60 days (applying for all groups), and within 30 days for union programmes including mobility measures. procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decisions in writing, and ensuring respect for the right to a legal remedy. provisions are also included in regard to communication: the member states would be required to make information available on the entry and residence conditions as set by this proposal, including on approved research organisations and on fees. taxes and fees: member states may charge fees for the processing of applications. however, the amount of such fees should not endanger the fulfilment of the directive's objectives. chapter viii - final provisions: member states would be required to establish national contact points to exchange information on third-country nationals covered by the proposal who move between member states. such national contact points already exist in relation to certain existing migration directives such as the blue card directive. member states would be required to communicate to the commission statistics on the numbers of third-country nationals granted authorisations. budgetary implication: the proposal has no implications for the eu’s budget."

therefore, the united kingdom and ireland do not participate in the adoption of the regulation and are not bound by it or subject to its application. denmark shall decide within six months of the council’s decision on this regulation whether to transpose it into national law or not. budgetary implications: the amount needed has been assessed as eur 212.1 million. during the development phase (2018-2020), the commission will spend a total amount of eur 4.2 million (via shared management) for the expenses related to operations in member states. from 2020, when the new system will be operational, future operational costs in member states could be supported by their national programmes in the framework of shared management. from the same year, the etias system will generate fee revenue, which will be treated as external assigned revenue. based on the current estimates of the number of applications, the fee revenue will more than cover the direct development and running cost of the etias. in turn, this will allow the financing of related expenditure in the field of smart borders. delegated acts: in order to establish the technical measures needed for the application of the regulation, the commission will have the power to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the eu."

the proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. content: the proposed regulation establishes visa requirements and visa exemptions for third-country nationals entering the eu for a short stay. common lists: the proposal for a regulation lists third countries whose nationals must have a visa to cross the external borders of a member state (annex i to the regulation). it also lists the countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement for stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period (annex ii of the regulation). determination of third countries whose nationals are subject to or exempt from the visa requirement is made on the basis of a case-by-case assessment of various criteria, relating inter alia to: illegal immigration, public policy and security; economic benefit, in particular in terms of tourism and foreign trade ; the union's external relations with the relevant third countries, including, in particular, considerations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. this assessment should be periodic and may lead to legislative proposals to amend the lists in annexes i and ii to the regulation. exceptions and exemptions : member states may grant exceptions to the visa requirement as regards certain categories of persons, e.g. holders of diplomatic passports, service or official passports or special passports, civilian air or sea crewmembers or crew and members of emergency or rescue missions. the following persons may be exempted from the visa requirement: a school pupil having the nationality of a third country listed in annex i who resides in a third country listed in annex ii or in switzerland and liechtenstein and who is travelling in the context of a school excursion as a member of a group of school pupils accompanied by a teacher from the school in question; recognised refugees and stateless persons if the third country where they reside and which issued their travel document is one of the third countries listed in annex ii; reciprocity mechanism : the regulation provides for a union mechanism allowing the implementation of the principle of reciprocity if one of the third countries included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement decides to make the nationals of one or more member states subject to the visa obligation. that mechanism should provide for a union response as an act of solidarity, if such a third country applies a visa requirement for nationals of at least one member state. suspension mechanism : the proposal also provides for a mechanism for the temporary suspension of the exemption from the visa requirement for a third country included in the list of third countries whose nationals are exempt from the visa requirement in an emergency situation, where an urgent response is needed in order to resolve the difficulties faced by at least one member state, and taking account of the overall impact of the emergency situation on the union as a whole. delegated acts: the proposal contains provisions empowering the commission to adopt delegated acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union in order to ensure the proper participation of the european parliament and the council in respect of certain elements of the reciprocity and suspension mechanisms."

(ii) member states would receive extra financial assistance under the erf iii, if they resettle according to these common eu annual priorities; (iii) ensuring an integrated approach between resettlement, external asylum policies and eu external policies as a whole. within the 2nd option, two sub-options are identified . the difference between these sub-options relate only to the mechanism which is foreseen for the political framework. sub-option 2a provides for the establishment of a new committee on resettlement under comitology rules. sub-option 2b provides for the use of existing structures. option 3: maximum option : u nder this option it is considered that a fully developed eu wide resettlement scheme will be established. resettlement would be carried out jointly in terms of priority setting and also in terms of implementation. however, this option is considered to be very ambitious and has been abandoned due to its lack of feasibility at the current stage of the union’s policy on this issue. conclusion : sub-option 2b is preferred option on grounds of political feasibility and proportionality. there is a strong preference among a majority of member states to build on existing consultation and decision making mechanisms. the current political situation is positive towards resettlement but reluctant to create any new formal structure, because of the bureaucratic burden this might entail and the fear that member states' freedom to decide on priorities themselves would be reduced. from the perspective of proportionality the use of existing structures is considered preferable, if this is as effective in reaching the objectives and if it is expected to have the same impacts. content: the proposed measures seek to amend the decision establishing the european refugee fund for the period 2008 to 2013 in order to provide additional financial support for the resettlement of those categories of persons which are annually identified as common eu resettlement priorities for the following year. annual resettlement priorities : the identification of these priorities will be done on the basis of an indicative forecast of resettlement needs which will be provided by unhcr in spring (mid-march) each year and in close consultation with the resettlement experts of member states, unhcr and other stakeholders. for this purpose an annual meeting will be organized in which these experts participate. on the basis of the outcomes of the meeting, the commission will draft a proposal for a decision identifying the common eu resettlement priorities, and will submit it for consultation to the management committee of the general programme ""solidarity and management of migratory flows' including the erf iii. within 20 calendar days following the adoption of the commission decision on common eu resettlement priorities, member states will provide the commission with an estimate of the number of persons whom they will resettle in the course of the following calendar year according to these common eu annual priorities. these annual priorities may relate to geographic regions, nationalities or specific categories of refugees to be resettled. additional financial assistance for a resettled refugee : on the basis of these pledges, member state will receive, as an additional financial assistance, a fixed amount of eur 4000 for each effectively resettled refugee during a respective calendar year who will fall under one of the specific categories which will be defined annually as common eu annual priorities by the decision of the commission. member states will receive this fixed amount per refugee only once in case such refugee would fall under more than one of the specific categories. timetable : the proposal provides for the setting up of a timetable as regards: the deadline for the submission of the pledging, necessary for the calculation of annual allocations between member states; the deadline for the submission of annual programmes by member states to the commission; the deadline for the adoption of financing decisions by the commission. in comparison to the deadlines set up in the current legal base, new deadlines are postponed due to the new procedure for the adoption of the common eu annual priorities for resettlement which will precede the calculation of annual allocations between member states. budgetary implications: the proposal complies with the appropriations and programming of the general programme ""solidarity and management of migration flows"" until 2013. furthermore, it does not alter the general objectives of the erf and its financial programming until 2013. only a very limited additional costs are foreseen with respect to administrative expenses (a total of eur 158 000 for the period 2010-2013)."

to add albania and bosnia and herzegovina to annex ii, part i of regulation (ec) no 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of member states and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. legal base: article 77(2)(a) of the treaty on the functioning of the eu. background: council regulation (ec) no 539/2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders (the negative list) and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement (the positive list). the determination of those third countries whose nationals are subject to the visa requirement, and those exempt from it, is governed by a considered, case-by-case assessment of a variety of criteria relating inter alia to illegal immigration, public policy and security, and to the eu’s external relations with third countries. consideration is also given to the implications of regional coherence and reciprocity. in view of the criteria of public order and illegal immigration, particular attention should be paid also to the security of travel documents issued by the third countries concerned. as the criteria set out in regulation (ec) no 539/2001 can evolve over time in relation to third countries, the composition of the negative and positive lists should be reviewed when appropriate. regulation (ec) no 539/2001 has been amended most recently with regard to the outcome of the visa liberalisation dialogues by transferring the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, montenegro and serbia to the positive list. in a joint declaration adopted in november 2009, the european parliament and the council underlined their political support for a quick abolition of the visa regime for the citizens of these two countries and urged the authorities of albania and bosnia and herzegovina to intensify efforts to comply with all the benchmarks set out in the commission's roadmaps. in addition, the european parliament and the council invited the commission to present a legislative proposal for amending the regulation (ec) no 539/2001 as soon as it had assessed that each country meets the benchmarks of the roadmaps, and took the commitment to examine the commission proposal as a matter of urgency. in april 2010, the commission presented to the european parliament and the council its assessment of the progress made by these two countries in the implementation of the remaining open benchmarks of the roadmaps towards visa liberalisation. the assessment reports concluded that albania and bosnia and herzegovina made important progress and only a very limited number of benchmarks remain open. impact assessment: none content: in proposing this amendment to regulation (ec) no 539/2001 as last amended by regulation (ec) no 1244/2009, the commission is pursuing the objective of adjusting the annexes to the regulation, taking into consideration the progress made in the visa liberalisation dialogues with albania and bosnia and herzegovina during the last seven months and transferring these two countries from annex i (the list of third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders of member states) to the annex ii (the list of those third countries whose nationals are exempt from that requirement) of the regulation. this transfer is in line with the political commitment taken by the eu on the liberalisation of the short-stay visa requirement for all western balkan citizens as part of the thessaloniki agenda. considering the introduction of biometric passports by the western balkan countries as an element of fundamental importance for the successful completion of the regional visa liberalisation process and as in regulation (ec) no 1244/2009, the proposal, for reasons relating to security and prevention of illegal migration, limits the visa waiver for the citizens of albania and bosnia and herzegovina to those persons holding the new biometric passports issued by these countries. in parallel with the examination of its proposal in the european parliament and the council, the commission will continue to assess the implementation of the open benchmarks for albania and bosnia and herzegovina and it will share its assessment in a timely manner with the european parliament and the council. for albania, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the development of a strategy and policy to support the reintegration of albanian returnees; the strengthening of capacities of law enforcement and the effective implementation of the legal framework for the fight against organised crime and corruption, including through the allocation of adequate human and financial resources; the effective implementation of the legal framework in the area of the confiscation of organised crime assets. for bosnia and herzegovina, the remaining open benchmarks relate to: the strengthening of capacities of law enforcement and the effective implementation of the legal framework for the fight against organised crime and corruption, including through the allocation of adequate human and financial resources; the progressive implementation of the action plan from march 2010 on establishment of electronic data exchange between police and prosecution bodies ; the harmonisation of the criminal codes of the entity level and brcko district with the state-level criminal code. as in regulation (ec) no 1244/2009, there is no reason to make the implementation of the visa waiver for albania and bosnia and herzegovina contingent on the conclusion of visa waiver agreements with the eu, taking into account the european vocation of these two countries and the fact that they have already exempted all eu citizens from the visa requirement. financial implications: the proposed amendment has no implication on the european union budget."

enhance the promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption in beneficiary countries; enhance capacity development to improve the capability of citizens, organisations, governments and societies to design sustainable development strategies; enhance democratic ownership (parliaments, local and regional authorities, civil society and other stakeholders); enable meaningful participation for citizens in civil society organisations; highlight the role played by local and regional authorities and their networks. parliament stresses that the aim of increasing the impact of aid and obtaining more results/value for money should not lead to a risk-averse development policy that only focuses on ‘easy countries’. the resolution insists that poverty eradication and needs must remain the crucial criteria for the allocation of eu development aid and that aid effectiveness must be improved by focusing on tangible results. they call on the commission and the member states to review the scope of financing instruments and to focus the disbursement of official development assistance (oda) on the poorest and most vulnerable countries and on reaching the poorest layers of society particularly those facing the greatest risks of social exclusion, such as women, children, elderly people and people with disabilities while taking into consideration the results achieved and the impact of aid. parliament stresses the need to distinguish between the development needs of the least developed countries (ldcs) and those of the middle income countries (mics), especially the emerging donors (to recall, 72% of the world's poor live in mics). furthermore, parliament takes the view that the eu's development policy should aim at eliminating obstacles to development, such as dumping of agricultural products, illegitimate debt burden, capital flight and unfair trade, and at creating an international environment conducive to fighting poverty, guaranteeing decent incomes and livelihoods and to the fulfilment of basic human rights, including social and economic rights. it reiterates the principle of the universality of human rights. it believes that in order to guarantee high impact the eu development policy should have an incentive-based approach based on greater differentiation by rewarding those countries that are performing well and supporting those that are most off track. meeting financial commitments : parliament reaffirms its position according to which the collective target of devoting 0.7% of the union’s gross national income (gni) to oda by 2015 must be met. it urges the commission and member states to find new sources of development funding such as a financial transaction tax at global level, private-sector finance and market-orientated solutions. they oppose any alteration or broadening of the definition of oda, as set by the oecd development assistance committee. once again, members call for increased efforts in the areas of development education and awareness-raising in europe. members underline that aid should be provided in a predictable manner that is aligned with national plans and priorities and provides incentives for greater transparency and accountability from donor governments, ngos, and partner states. promoting pro-poor growth : parliament stresses that growth is only one instrument among many, and that maximising growth is not equivalent to maximising development. the impact of growth on poverty eradication could be much higher if inequality were reduced and human rights respected. members insist, therefore, that eu development assistance must be geared towards pro-poor growth through the adoption of measures which specifically focus on the poor and the marginalized in order to foster an increase in their share of national wealth and allow them to become a driving force for genuinely inclusive growth, such as micro-credit and micro-finance, as well as other market-derived solutions. the resolution stresses that economic growth policies cannot succeed without promotion of social and environmental standards and the implementation of social protection mechanisms. further measures are laid down: favour measures which provide security of land tenure and facilitate poor people’s access to land, markets, credits and other financial services and skills development; promote industrial development and the development of infrastructure ; limit the effects of greenhouse gas emissions; strengthen large-scale export and property rights; diversify the economies of developing countries and reducing their dependence on imports need to be priority objectives for policies supporting growth; human development : parliament emphasises that the provision of basic social services is crucial to pro-poor growth and reaching the mdgs. it calls for 20% of all eu assistance to be earmarked for basic social services. members underline that girls’ education and the promotion of gender equality in education are vital to development, and that policies and actions that do not address gender disparities miss critical development opportunities. the resolution stresses the importance of bridging financing gaps in health systems resulting from priorities such as sexual and reproductive health suffering cuts, and emphasises the importance of investing in the fight against hiv/aids and other diseases. it reiterates its view that the eu must support partner countries in developing fair, transparent and effective tax systems to generate the revenues needed for social protection and pro-poor policies, and must at an international level continue to work for greater financial transparency and to ensure that partner countries share the benefits. involving the private sector : parliament recalls that 90% of jobs in developing countries are in the private sector. eu development aid should focus on financing for domestic companies, leveraging of domestic capitals and encouraging recipient countries to create an environment conducive to the development of small, medium-sized and micro-enterprises and on the removal of barriers to formalisation, access to capital and affordable credit and that services and capacity-building should be targeted in particular on poorer entrepreneurs. in this context, parliament calls on the commission to: promote and support, among other things, social-economy enterprises that work in accordance with ethical and economic principles; strengthen public investments in public goods, infrastructure and services; object to any kind of cooperation with private entities which would contribute directly or indirectly to any form of tax evasion or tax avoidance; favour investors that support the partner country’s development strategy, and to give preferential treatment to domestic and regional investors in order to promote regional integration; strengthen public private partnerships (ppp), which involve the private sector in development; fight corruption, within both businesses and ngos, as well as in governments and public authorities. members call on the eu to meet its aid for trade strategy commitments on development assistance specifically targeted at projects designed to help developing countries develop their trade-related skills, improve the supply chain and ultimately compete in regional and global markets. climate change, energy and sustainable development : parliament prioritises support for local and regional sustainable energy solutions, and decentralised energy production in particular, so as to bring development priorities in line with environmental concerns. it notes the huge potential for renewable energy (solar energy, wind power, geothermal energy and biomass) in many developing countries. parliament reiterates that developed countries have a duty to take the lead in building the low-carbon global economy needed to achieve the necessary emission cuts. it encourages member states to take the lead in cutting emissions. the resolution calls for a holistic approach which integrates the environmental dimension in development programmes and projects for example by improving regulations concerning waste transfer and illegal logging. t he commission is called upon to assess the impact of ‘climate migration’, a phenomenon that some estimate will cause 200 million people to leave their homes by 2050 as conditions in their lands gradually worsen and emphasises that the european union must contribute through its development policy to providing assistance and reducing the number of refugees, by investing in technologies, human resources and financial aid. parliament reiterates its position that mainstreaming cannot replace the provision of new and additional resources which the eu and other donors have committed towards developing countries climate change mitigation efforts and adaptation needs. food security and agriculture : parliament reiterates its position that the eu should focus its development assistance on safeguarding the food security of developing countries and promoting sustainable, local, small-scale and organic agricultural production. it calls in particular for: a switch to organic and ecologically sustainable farming; specific support to women in agriculture; the root causes of food insecurity, including weak accountability for the right to food, food-price speculation and ‘land grabbing’ should be addressed. members recall that, in order to feed a world population expected to surpass 9 billion in 2050, agricultural output will have to increase by 70% between now and then, using less land, less water and fewer pesticides. they note that global food security is a question of the utmost urgency for the european union and calls for immediate and consistent action to ensure food security both for eu citizens and at the global level. the resolution underlines that tackling food insecurity means implementing many measures in diverse sectors, such as the management of local natural resources, the reinforcement of production and manufacturing, training, the structuring of professional organisations, the implementation of a safety net for the most vulnerable, the education on nutrition and also the diversification of rural jobs beyond agriculture to enhance the income of rural families, who are the first victims of hunger. parliament expresses its deep concern about the current farmland acquisition by government-backed foreign investors, particularly in africa, which risks undermining local food security and causing unforeseen and far-reaching social unrest if it is not properly handled. transparency : lastly, in order to increase transparency and public acceptance of development projects funded fully or partially by the eu or the member states, parliament calls for creating an electronic data base that provides information on oda."

to amend council regulation (ec) no 2007/2004 establishing a european agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the european union (frontex) to clarify the mandate of the agency and address shortcomings. proposed act: council regulation. background: the frontex agency was set up in 2004 and became operational in 2005. in 2008, the commission adopted a communication on the evaluation and future development of the frontex agency, accompanied by a impact assessment. the communication issued recommendations for the short to medium term and launched ideas for the future development of the agency in the longer term. it was welcomed by the council and the european parliament, who both shared the commissions assessment that the agency had been very successful since its inception and called for a further strengthening of the agency. an independent evaluation also took place during 2008, on the basis of which the frontex management board made a series of recommendations concerning changes to the legal basis of the agency. this proposal reflects all recommendations of the 2008 communication and the management board recommendations to the extent they require a revision of the legal framework of the agency, with the exceptions as described in the impact assessment. impact assessment: an impact assessment has been carried out - commission staff working document sec(2010)0149. the preferred option of the impact assessment consists of a combination of the following sub-options: a revised mechanism with compulsory contributions of equipment from member states combined with the gradual acquisition/leasing by frontex of its own equipment, based on further analyses of needs and costs; a revised mechanism with compulsory contributions of human resources from member states combined with a pool of border guards on semi-permanent detachment from member states to frontex, with the status of national experts; awarding the agency a co-leading role for the implementation of joint operations, with detailed rules for the operational plan, evaluation, and incident reporting, to be enforced by frontex; allowing frontex to finance and implement technical assistance projects in third countries and to deploy liaison officers in third countries; giving frontex a limited mandate to process personal data related to fight against criminal networks organising illegal immigration, under condition that such processing of personal data by frontex is lawful, necessary and proportionate in relation to the tasks of the agency; giving frontex a coordinating role in implementing joint return operations; giving frontex a mandate to analyse operational risks and requirements in the member states. the preferred option is fully reflected in this legislative proposal with the exception of giving frontex a limited mandate to process personal data related to fighting criminal networks organising illegal immigration. the commission does consider that all possibilities to reinforce the fight against the smuggling of migrants and against trafficking of human beings should be explored. however, it prefers to return to the question of personal data in the context of the overall strategy for information exchange to be presented later this year and also taking into account the reflection to be carried out on how to further develop cooperation between agencies in the justice and home affairs field as requested by the stockholm programme. legal basis: articles 74 and 77 (1) (b) and (c) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). the proposal is within the limits set by these provisions and, in particular, respects the shared competencies of the treaty in that member states remain responsible for controlling their external borders. notably this proposal upholds the principle that in the context of operations coordinated by the agency, guest officers may only perform tasks and exercise powers under instructions from and, as a general rule, in the presence of border guards of the host member state. decisions to refuse entry in accordance with the schengen borders code shall be taken only by border guards of the host member state. no decision-making power in this regard is transferred to the agency. the objectives of this proposal, while respecting the same fundamental limitations of the existing provisions, are to further develop an integrated management of operational cooperation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states. content: the commission presents a proposal to strengthen the frontex agency. the most important amendments to council regulation (ec) no 2007/2004 reflect the changes necessary to accommodate the preferred option of the impact assessment. moreover a number of minor amendments of an essentially administrative character have been introduced taking into account the management board recommendations as well as the introduction of new ""standard"" provisions used in other commission proposals for the setting up of new agencies. the main amendments to the regulation are as follows: establishment of the agency : the proposal clarifies the legal framework in which the agency operates. it states that, while considering that the responsibility for the control and surveillance of external borders lies with the member states, the agency shall facilitate and render more effective the application of existing and future eu measures relating to the management of external borders, in particular the schengen borders code, and in accordance with relevant union law, international law, obligations related to access to international protection, and fundamental rights. it shall do so by ensuring the coordination of member states' actions in the implementation of those measures, thereby contributing to an efficient, high and uniform level of control on persons and surveillance of the external borders of the member states. definitions : the proposal clarifies the definition of ""host member state"", and introduces the concept of frontex joint support teams, and revises the definition of technical equipment. main tasks : these include risk analysis and research. the proposal introduces the possibility for the agency of coordinating joint return operations. the agency also has new tasks related to the development and operation of information systems and to the provision of assistance to eurosur. in addition, all personnel taking part in joint operations or joint return operations are required to have received appropriate training in fundamental rights. lastly, a reporting mechanism to the management board regarding the operational activities of member states with third countries is introduced. joint operations and pilot projects at the external borders : the agency is required to draw up an operational plan, to conduct a prior risk analysis. the agency may also terminate joint operations and pilot projects if the conditions to conduct these initiatives are no longer fulfilled. furthermore, it shall constitute a pool of border guards called frontex joint support teams, for possible deployment during joint operations and pilot projects. the proposal requires the agency to evaluate the results of the joint operations and pilot projects and transmit the detailed evaluation reports within 60 days following the end of the activity to the management board. lastly, it provides that the agency may decide to finance or co-finance the joint operations and pilot projects, with grants from its budget in accordance with the financial rules applicable to the agency."" organisational aspects of joint operations and pilot projects : a new article sets out the obligation to draw up an operational plan for all operations. this article makes provision regarding the content of the operational plan, the respective tasks and responsibilities, the composition of the teams, command and control, the reporting mechanisms i.e. evaluation and incident reporting, the technical equipment, and the applicable jurisdiction. the agency and the requesting member state must agree on the operational plan and the agency must ensure the operational implementation of all organisational aspects. composition and deployment of frontex joint support teams (fjst): a new article sets out the obligations and conditions related to border guards to be made available to the fjst. member states must make the border guards available for deployment. members of the teams must perform their duties in full respect of fundamental rights and human dignity. the agency must nominate a coordinating officer where fjst members are deployed. it will meet the costs of border guards of member states participating in fjst risk analysis: for the agency’s risk analysis, member states must provide the agency with all necessary information regarding the situation and possible threats at the external borders. the agency shall regularly evaluate the capacity of the member states to face upcoming challenges, including present and future threats and pressures at the external borders of the eu. training: member states must integrate the common core curricula in the training of national border guards. the training must include fundamental rights aspects. research: the proposal strengthens the role of the agency i.e. monitoring and contributing to developments in relevant research activities technical equipment : the new provisions clarify the agency’s powers regarding the acquisition or lease of technical equipment and the rules of registration for heavy equipment the agency must also keep centralised records of a technical equipment pool (tep). member states must contribute to the tep to allow for a minimum amount of equipment covering the needs of the agency. the article sets out rules regarding the management by the agency of the tep, and rules for the reimbursement of the minimum numbers per type of equipment, and the conditions for deployment and the eligible costs return cooperation : the proposal clarifies eu return policy, financial provisions and inserts the possibility for a member state to request the agency to ensure the coordination of a return operation. the agency must adopt a code of conduct to be applied during joint return operations, including with regard to forced return monitoring and respect for fundamental rights. member states must inform the agency of their planned return operations and the degree of assistance requested from the agency. the agency must draw up a rolling operational plan on which the management board decides. the proposal clarifies the role of the agency regarding the identification of relevant third countries information exchange systems : the agency is required develop and operate an information system capable of exchanging classified information. data protection : a new article requires the agency to process data in accordance with regulation 45/2001 and the management board to establish measures to apply the aforementioned regulation. security rules on the protection of classified information and non-classified sensitive information : another new article requires the agency to apply the security principles of decision 2001/844 for classified information, and to process non-classified sensitive information as adopted and implemented by the commission. facilitation of operational cooperation with third countries and cooperation with competent authorities of third countries : the proposal gives the agency the possibility of deploying liaison officers in third countries, and the tasks of the latter are set out in the text. the agency may benefit from union funding in accordance with the provisions of the relevant instruments supporting the union's external relations policy. member states must clarify where appropriate the role of the agency in their bilateral agreements with third countries. the deployment of liaison officers and the conclusion of working arrangements with third countries are subject to prior approval by the commission. headquarters agreement : a new clause clarifies the need for a headquarters agreement between the agency and the hosting member state. in addition, the proposal makes some modifications on provisions related to staff, the powers of the management board on staffing policy, the composition of the management board and the functions and powers of the executive director. budgetary implication: the proposal amends an existing regulation regarding the mandate and functioning of a european agency. the subsidy related to the frontex agency forms already part of the union's budget."

1901, the customs administration act 1985, the migration act 1958, the crimes act 1914, the privacy act 1988 and the freedom of information act 1982. this legislation aims at obtaining pnr data electronically in advance of a flight's arrival and therefore significantly enhances the australian customs service’s ability to conduct efficient and effective advance risk assessment of passenger and to facilitate bona fide travel, thereby enhancing the security of australia. the european union in cooperating with australia in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime views the transfer of data to australia as fostering international police and judicial cooperation which will be achieved though the transfer of analytical information flowing from pnr data by australia to the competent member states authorities as well as europol and eurojust within their respective competences. the european union signed an agreement in 2008 with australia on the transfer and processing of pnr data based on a set of commitments by the australian customs service in relation to the application of its pnr programme. following the entry into force of the lisbon treaty and pending the conclusion of the agreement, the council sent the 2008 australia agreement to the european parliament for its consent for the conclusion. the european parliament adopted a resolution in which it decided to postpone its vote on the requested consent and requesting a renegotiation of the agreement on the basis of certain criteria (see rsp/2010/2657 ). pending such renegotiation, the 2008 agreement would remain provisionally applicable. on 23 september 2010, the council received three recommendations from the commission to authorise the opening of negotiations for an agreement between the european union and australia for the transfer and use of passenger name record (pnr) data to prevent and combat terrorism and other serious transnational crime. on 11 november 2010, the european parliament adopted a resolution on the recommendation from the commission to the council to authorise the opening of the negotiations. on 2 december 2010, the council adopted a decision, together with a negotiation directive, authorising the commission to open negotiations on behalf of the european union. it is now proposed to conclude the agreement. impact assessment: no impact assessment was undertaken. legal basis: articles 82(1)(d) and 87(2)(a), in conjunction with article 218 (6)(a) of the tfeu. content: the proposal aims to conclude the agreement between the european union and australia on the processing and transfer of passenger name record (pnr) data by air carriers to the australian customs and border protection service. pnr and basic principles of the agreement : to recall, pnr is a record of each passenger' travel requirements which contains all information necessary to enable reservations to be processed and controlled by air carriers.air carriers are under an obligation to provide the australian customs service with access to certain pnr data to the extent it is collected and contained in the air carrier's automated reservation and departure control systems. however, the data protection laws of the eu do not allow european and other carriers operating flight from the eu to transmit the pnr data of their passengers to third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of protection of personal data without adducing appropriate safeguards. accordingly, a solution is required that will provide the legal basis for the transfer of pnr data from the eu to australia as a recognition of the necessity and importance of the use of pnr data in the fight against terrorism and other serious transnational crime, whilst avoiding legal uncertainty for air carriers. in addition, this solution should be applied homogenously throughout the european union in order to ensure a legal certainty for air carriers and respect of individuals' rights to the protection of personal data as well as their physical security. safeguards: the agreement has secured several important safeguards for those whose data will be transferred and processed. in particular, the purpose of processing of pnr data is strictly limited to preventing, detecting, investigating and prosecuting terrorist offences and serious transnational crime. individuals are provided with the right to access, correction, redress and information. the data will be transferred using exclusively the 'push' method and the use of sensitive data is prohibited. retention period: the retention period of the pnr data is limited and the data will be depersonalised after a certain period. compliance: compliance with these rules shall be subject to independent oversight by the australian information commissioner. fundamental rights: the agreement respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the charter of fundamental rights of the european union, notably the right to private and family life, the right to the protection of personal data, and the right to effective remedy and fair trial. the united kingdom and ireland take part in the adoption of the decision. budgetary implications: the proposal has no implications for the eu budget."

iii) product specification; iv) member states scope; v) deadline for migration, and vi) clarity on the long term business model for pan-european direct debits. legal base: article 114(1) of the treaty on the functioning of the eu (tfeu). content: the proposal for setting technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits is aimed at: setting up separate migration end-dates for credit transfers and direct debits respectively , by introducing a set of common standards and general technical requirements; ensuring reachability of payment service providers for credit transfer transactions , along the lines of the reachability obligation for direct debit transactions under regulation (ec) no 924/2009 and interoperability of payment systems. the main features of the regulation are as follows: purpose and scope : the proposal covers the execution of all credit transfer and direct debit transactions denominated in euros within the union. it does not cover some types of payment transactions -such as payment card transactions, money remittance and payment transactions through means of any telecommunication, digital or it device which do not result in a credit transfer or direct debit. to promote competition and efficiency, the regulation should not foreclose from the market non-'traditional' payment schemes, in particular when they are based on combined schemes rules including a direct debit or credit transfer segment. hence, the provisions of this regulation only apply to the credit transfer or direct debit underlying the transaction. definitions: these are aligned, as much as possible, with those used in directive 2007/64/ec. however, given the regulation’s limited scope in comparison with the payment services directive, some of the definitions have been tailored to the needs of this proposal. reachability of payment service providers for credit transfer transactions is integrated with the reachability obligation for direct debit transactions under article 8 of regulation (ec) no 924/2009. technical interoperability : the proposal contains provisions which are necessary for the smooth functioning of payment schemes and systems, so that they can interact with each other across the union using the same standards, without technical obstacles to the processing of payments by the market players. technical requirements for credit transfer and direct debit transactions : the text introduces deadlines for migration to union-wide instruments, by making certain important standards used by the payment industry mandatory and defining technical requirements applying to both payment service providers and customers. no later than 12 months after the entry into force of the regulation, credit transfers shall be carried out in accordance with the technical requirements set out in the annex. the deadline for direct debit transactions is set at 24 months after the entry into force of the regulation. interchange fees for direct debit transactions: the proposal clarifies that, after 31 october 2012, multilateral interchange fees (mifs) per transaction are not allowed for national and cross-border direct debits. it also defines general conditions for interchange fees (multilateral, bilateral and unilateral) for r-transactions, in line with the working document on the 'applicability of article 81 of the ec treaty to multilateral interbank-payments in sdd' published by the commission on 3 november 2009. waiver: this provision applies to so-called 'legacy' niche products which should also be phased out after an appropriate transitional period. payment accessibility : the proposal ensures that if a euro credit transfer or a euro direct debit is accepted domestically, it will also be used to and from a euro account on a cross-border basis. competent authorities : the competent authorities would be empowered to take necessary measures to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in this regulation. penalties : member states are required to provide details of penalties to the commission. budgetary implication: leaving aside the normal administrative costs linked to ensuring the respect of eu legislation, there will be no budgetary impact since no new committees are created and no financial commitments are made. however, the commission is also a significant user of payment services in its own right and therefore should benefit, along with other users, from enhanced competition generated by sepa."

to amend council regulation (ec) no 1698/2005 on support for rural development by the european agricultural fund for rural development (eafrd) in order to align it with the lisbon treaty and to implement a number simplification proposals as part of the simplification exercise of the cap. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council background: council regulation (ec) no 1698/2005 confers powers on the commission in order to implement some of the provisions of that regulation. as a consequence of the entry into force of the lisbon treaty, the powers conferred under regulation (ec) no 1698/2005 upon the commission need to be aligned to articles 290 (delegated acts) and 291 (implementing acts) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). impact assessment: no impact assessment was carried out. legal base: article 43 of the tfeu. content: this proposal aims to identify the delegated and implementing powers of the commission in council regulation (ec) no 1698/2005 and establish the corresponding procedure for adoption of these acts. pursuant to article 290 of the treaty , the proposal allows the commission to adopt delegated acts in order to: adopt exceptions to the rule that no rural development support should be granted to schemes eligible for support under common market organisations; adopt detailed conditions concerning all the measures and technical assistance in order to ensure their coherent application in line with the requirements of eu policy, priorities and law; make detailed rules for reductions and exclusions; define a flexibility threshold for each axis; define detailed rules for forms of support other than non-repayable direct assistance; the commission shall fix detailed control rules and adopt specific transitional measures. in accordance with article 291 of the treaty member states are responsible for implementing the regime established by the legislator. however, it seems necessary to ensure uniform implementation of the scheme in member states in order to avoid distortions of competition or discrimination between operators. therefore, the legislator gives the commission powers of enforcement as regards: the uniform conditions for the presentation of rural development programmes; programme approval; approval of revision of programmes; determination of changes requiring approval by commission decision; longer commitment periods; specific provisions on designation of areas; the establishment and operation of the national rural network; presentation of specific annual reports; a general framework of controls and a common monitoring and evaluation framework that member states shall implement. additionally, some elements of simplification are introduced: reduction of the number of summary reports and simplification of their content under strategic monitoring: a s part of the simplification exercise of the cap member states wanted a reduction in the number of reports to the commission. in addition to annual progress reports, member states are required to submit to the commission summary reports setting out the progress made in implementing their national strategy plans and objectives and their contribution to the achievement of the community strategic guidelines. under the current rules, these summary reports are to be submitted each second year, starting from 2010 and ending in 2014, i.e. altogether three reports. the proposal will limit the number of reports to two, the first one to be submitted in 2010 and the second one in 2015, the former in the context of mid-term evaluation and the latter of ex post evaluation. in addition, the report is required to summarise the previous year's annual progress reports. this requirement should be dropped, as it duplicates work. the number of commission reports summarising the main developments, trends and challenges relating to the implementation of the national strategy plans and the community strategic guidelines will bw reduced to two, one in 2011 and the second one in 2016. extension of the coverage of the measure for producer groups: the current provision on support for producer groups, which is already available for all sectors in the new member states, should be extended to also cover eu-15. however, there will be support for producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector as their activities may be supported under the single cmo. facilitating more tailor-made use of the advisory services: mem ber states had proposed changing the rules for use of advisory services. currently the rules require that, as a minimum, the advisory service to farmers should cover the statutory management requirements and the good agricultural and environmental conditions under cross-compliance as well as the occupational safety standards based on union legislation. in order to facilitate more tailor-made use of the advisory services and to reflect the individual needs of the beneficiary, the advisory service provided will not need to cover all the aspects listed, but one or more of them. continuous linear features and stepping stones: a ccording to article 10 of the habitats directive, member states shall endeavour, with a view to improving the ecological coherence of the natura 2000 network, to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora. such features are those which, by virtue of their linear and continuous structure (such as rivers with their banks or the traditional systems for marking field boundaries) or their function as stepping stones (such as ponds or small woods), are essential for the migration, dispersal and genetic exchange of wild species. these areas can play an important role for the coherence of natura 2000 areas and relevant provisions should be included in order to allow natura 2000 payments for these nationally delimited nature protection areas if sufficient justification is provided linking them to article 10 of the habitats directive. in order to ensure that payments continue to be primarily used for the designated natura 2000 sites, it is proposed to limit their proportion compared to the natura 2000 areas. however, this provision is without prejudice to the endeavours of member states under the habitats directive related to encouraging the management of landscape features which are of major importance for wild fauna and flora and does not prejudice the question of what constitutes an adequate implementation of article 10 of the habitats directive. follow up of non-compliances of the cross-compliance: member state can decide to consider a case of non-compliance as minor or not to apply a reduction or exclusion where the amount concerned is less than eur 100. currently, the competent control authority should ensure that the farmer remedies the findings of the non-compliance concerned. however, with a view to simplification and in order to ease the administrative burden, consideration should be given to simplifying the follow-up checks system. introducing incentive element for measures falling under article 43 of the treaty: i n order to be compatible with the common market, any aid measure must contain some incentive element or require some counterpart on the part of the beneficiary. aid which is granted retroactively in respect of activities which have already been undertaken by the beneficiary cannot be considered to contain the necessary incentive element. however, for co-financed rural development measures approved under article 43 of the treaty, there is currently no requirement for an incentive effect laid down in the union legislation, except in the case of top-ups to which agricultural state aid rules apply. therefore, retroactive granting of aid should also be prohibited for co-financed agricultural measures and a starting date of eligibility should be provided. financial implications: this measure does not involve any additional union expenditure."

to establish the european year of citizens (2013). proposed act: decision of the european parliament and of the council. background: in 2009, an estimated 11.9 million union citizens were living in another member state than their own and many more might exercise this right at some point in their lives: a eurobarometer survey conducted in 2009 showed that more than one third (35%) of european citizens would consider working in another member state. however, close to one in five europeans see too many obstacles to working in another member state. lack of information is (together with language difficulties) is the most important barrier to cross-border commuting, which constitutes, besides trans-national migration, the main form of geographic labour mobility within the eu. recent surveys have also shown that the information citizens need in order to exercise their right to free movement is not strictly limited to the conditions for using this right as such: amongst the administrative issues which people had looked at prior to moving to another member state, the two items mentioned most often were social security and welfare and the recognition of academic diplomas. it is clear that citizens who wish to study, work, retire, live in another member state need to be adequately informed about the different rights available to them in cross-border situations and to be able to effectively enjoy them in practice. without this knowledge citizens are not able to make informed decisions about making use of their free movement rights. more broadly, citizens' awareness of their rights to free movement and more generally of their rights as union citizens is crucial to enable individuals, businesses and society as a whole to benefit from the full range of opportunities available in the single market. the significant gaps in citizens' awareness of their rights were demonstrated by a 2010 eurobarometer survey which showed that, although europeans are broadly aware of their status as union citizens (79% claim some familiarity with the term 'citizen of the european union'), they lack concrete knowledge about the exact meaning of rights attached to this status. more specifically, only 43% know the meaning of the term 'citizen of the european union' and almost half of european citizens (48%) indicate that they are not well informed about their rights. in the eu citizenship report 2010""dismantling the obstacles to eu citizens' rights"", the commission identified main obstacles which citizens still encounter in their daily lives when they seek to exercise their rights as union citizens and outlined 25 concrete actions to remove these obstacles. in the context of this exercise, the commission concluded that union citizens are prevented from enjoying their rights because they lack awareness of them and announced its intention to step up the dissemination of information to union citizens about their rights as such and in particular about their free movement rights. the designation of 2013 as the european year of citizens, leading to the organisation of targeted events on eu citizenship and citizen-related eu policies during this year, is thus listed in the eu citizenship report 2010 as one of the actions to implement in order to remedy this lack of awareness. impact assessment: an ex-ante evaluation was carried out, which indicated amongst other matters, that the actions to be implemented in the proposed european year do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives. the proposal respects therefore the principle of proportionality. legal basis: article 21(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the eu (tfeu). although member states retain the primary responsibility for raising citizens' awareness of their rights as union citizens, adequate actions to address this problem require multilateral partnerships, transnational exchanges of information and experience and union-wide awareness-raising and dissemination of good practices. therefore, the objectives of the proposed european year can be better achieved at union level. content: the year 2013 shall be designated as the european year of citizens. the overall purpose of the proposed european year of citizens is to ensure that all union citizens are aware of the rights available to them in a cross-border context by virtue of their union citizenship status, so as to enable them to make informed decisions about whether to make use of their right to free movement and to facilitate the effective exercise of this right. the european year will aim, more specifically, at: raising union citizens' awareness of their right to move and reside freely within the european union and more generally the rights guaranteed to union citizens in cross-border situations, including their right to participate in the democratic life of the union; raising union citizens' awareness of how they can tangibly benefit from eu rights and policies while living in another member state, and at stimulating their active participation in civic fora on union policies and issues; stimulating a debate about the impact and potential of the right to free movement, as an inalienable aspect of union citizenship, in particular in terms of strengthening societal cohesion and mutual understanding between union citizens and the bond between citizens and the union. initiatives involved : the measures to be taken to achieve these objectives may include the following initiatives organised at union, national, regional or local level linked to the objectives of the european year: information, education and awareness raising campaigns targeted at the general public and more specific audiences; exchange of information, sharing of experience and good practices of national, regional, local administrations and other organisations; conferences and events to promote debate and raise awareness of the importance and benefits of the right to free movement and residence and more generally citizens' rights as union citizens; use of the existing multilingual participatory tools to stimulate citizens' contributions in giving tangible effect to their rights and more generally in achieving the objectives of the european year; strengthening of the role and visibility of the multilingual europe direct and your europe web portal as key elements of a 'one-stop-shop' information system on union citizens' rights; strengthening of the role and visibility of problem solving tools, such as solvit, to allow union citizens to better make use of and defend their rights. coordination at union level : the commission shall cooperate closely with member states and bodies and associations which represent local and regional interests, in particular the committee of regions. it will also cooperate closely with the european economic and social committee. it will convene meetings of representatives of european organisations or bodies active in the field of defending citizens' rights and stakeholders to assist the commission in implementing the european year at union level. evaluation :by 31 december 2014, the commission shall submit a report to the european parliament, the council, the european economic and social committee and the committee of the regions on the implementation, results and overall assessment of the initiatives provided for in the decision. financial implications: no additional funding is sought for the european year. the flexibility for annual priority setting based on the budget lines and programmes of the directorate general for communication provides sufficient financial margin for running the year on a eur 1 million scale."

to increase the co-financing rate of the european refugee fund, the european return fund and the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals for certain member states experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability, and amending decision no 573/2007/ec, decision no 575/2007/ec and council decision 2007/435/ec. proposed act: decision of the european parliament and of the council. background: decision no 573/2007/ec established the european refugee fund , decision no 575/2007/ec established the european return fund and council decision 2007/435/ec established the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals , as part of the general programme ‘solidarity and management of migration flows’. these funds provide for different union co-financing rates for actions supported by the funds. the unprecedented global financial crisis and economic downturn have seriously damaged economic growth and financial stability, provoking a marked deterioration in financial, economic and social conditions in several member states. some member states are experiencing serious difficulties or are threatened with such difficulties, particularly with respect to their financial and economic stability, leading to deterioration in their deficit and debt positions and threatening economic growth heightened by the international economic and financial environment. ensuring the smooth implementation of programmes adopted under the four funds established as part of the general programme on ‘solidarity and management of migration flows’ (‘the funds’), is of particular importance as a means of injecting funds into the economy. to make european union funding easier to manage in the area of migration, asylum and external borders and to improve the availability of funding for the member states to implement their annual programmes under the funds, it is necessary, on a temporary basis and without prejudice to the 2014-2020 programming period, to arrange for an increase in the union co-financing rate under the funds, by an amount corresponding to twenty percentage points above the co-financing rates currently applicable, for member states experiencing serious difficulties with respect to their financial stability. it should be noted that this proposal is closely linked to the proposal regarding a similar amendment of the external borders fund (please see cod/2012/0253 ). legal basis: articles 78(2) and article 79(2) and (4) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). impact assessment: there was no consultation of external stakeholders. the proposal will allow the commission to apply higher co-financing rates for the countries benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. content: in order to ensure that member states benefiting from a financial support mechanism continue to implement the programmes adopted under the funds on the ground and disburse funds to projects, the proposal contains provisions that would allow the commission to increase the union co-financing rate for these countries, for the period during which they benefit from financial assistance provided by one of the support mechanisms under any funding instruments. this will provide additional financial resources to the member states and will make it easier to continue implementing the programmes on the ground. the funds’ annual national allocation pursuant to the basic acts will remain unchanged while national co-financing will be reduced accordingly. ongoing annual programmes will need to be revised to reflect the changes resulting from the application of the increased union co-financing rate. the proposal makes provision for the following amendments: amendment of article 14 and article 21(3) of decision no 573/2007/ec: article 14 currently provides that the union co-financing rate for supported actions does not in principle exceed 50% (and that this union co-financing rate may be increased to 75% if the member state in question is covered by the cohesion fund). under this proposal, it is proposed that the union contribution could to be increased by 20 percentage points, if the member state satisfies one of the following conditions at the time at which they submit their draft annual programme: i) article 21(3) of decision no 573/2007/ec provides that financial assistance from the european refugee fund for emergency measures shall not exceed 80% of the cost of each measure. the commission proposes to allow the union co-financing rate applicable to the european refugee fund programmes of the member states concerned to be increased by 20 percentage points, provided they are benefiting from one of the support mechanisms. amendment of article 15 of decision no 575/2007/ec establishing the european return fund and amendment of article 13 of council decision 2007/435/ec establishing the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007 to 2013 have identical content to article 14 of decision no 573/2007/ec. the proposal contains a similar provision increasing the union co-financing rate by 20 percentage points. annual programme : once a decision granting financial assistance to a member state under one of the support mechanisms has been taken, the member state may submit to the commission either a draft annual programme or a draft revised annual programme applying the increased union co-financing rate. however, once an action of a specific annual programme has been co-financed at the increased union co-financing rate, it remains so until the end of the eligibility period of the related annual programme whether or not the member state still benefits from one of the support mechanisms. budgetary implications: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modifications are proposed to the maximum amounts of the funds' financing provided for in

financial assistance in accordance with council regulation (eu) no 407/2010 or financial assistance from other euro area member states before the entry into force of that regulation; financial assistance in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement reached establishing the european financial stability facility or the treaty establishing the european stability mechanism. however, once an action of a specific annual programme has been co-financed at the increased union co-financing rate, it remains so until the end of the eligibility period of the related annual programme whether or not the member state still benefits from one of the support mechanisms. budgetary implications: there is no impact on commitment appropriations since no modifications are proposed to the maximum amounts of the funds' financing provided for in the annual programmes for the programming period 2007-2013. the proposal states that it shows the commission's willingness to assist member states in their efforts to deal with the financial crisis. the amendments will provide the member states concerned with the necessary funds to support projects and economic recovery."

to amend regulation (ec) no 562/2006 of the european parliament and of the council establishing a community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (schengen borders code) and the convention implementing the schengen agreement to take account of the experience gained since the entry into force of these legal instruments. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: on 13 october 2006, regulation (ec) no 562/2006 of the european parliament and of the council establishing a community code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (schengen borders code) entered into force. after four years of practical application, the need for a number of limited technical amendments has emerged. the main sources for these amendments are: practical experiences of the member states and the commission in the application of the schengen borders code, including the results of schengen evaluations and the reports and requests submitted by member states; the commission reporton the operation of the provisions on stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals in accordance with articles 10 and 11 of the schengen borders code and commission report on the application of title iii (internal borders) of the schengen borders code; consistency considerations linked to other recently adopted legislation, in particular the visa code (regulation (ec) no 810/2009) and the return directive (directive 2008/115/ec). this proposal contains amendments that improve clarity and narrow the scope for divergent interpretations of the existing text as well as amendments responding to practical problems that have arisen during the first years of the schengen borders code. furthermore it provides for an explicit legal framework for bilateral agreements related to joint border checks on road traffic. new policy initiatives, such as the creation of an eu entry/exit system and an eu registered traveller programme, will be the subject of specific proposals to be discussed separately. impact assessment: no impact assessment was carried out. legal basis: article 77(1) and 77(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: the main proposed amendments concern the following issues: definitions : the proposal provides a clear definition of the method for calculating ‘stays not exceeding three months per six month period’ (article 5). following the judgment delivered by the ecj on 3 october 2006 in case c-241/05, bot, and the adoption of a related parallel provision in article 2(2)(a) of the visa code, clarified and authentic legislative guidance on this issue is needed for the schengen borders code. the definition of residence permit is also reshaped. in order to avoid any misunderstanding, it is made clear that visas (both long-stay and short-stay) can never be considered as ‘residence permits’ within the meaning of point 15(b). duration of the validity of certain travel documents : a clarification is made concerning the required period of validity of travel documents of non-visa holders (article 5), in response to practical needs and in order to align the text with article 12 of the visa code. creating separate lanes for certain travellers : the proposal foresees the possibility to create separate lanes for visa-free travellers (article 9) in order to provide additional flexibility and speed up border control in accordance with practical needs. stamping of the travel documents of third-country nationals : the situation of train crews on international connections is comparable to pilots or seamen as these trains follow a fixed schedule. the commission already announced that it would introduce an exemption from stamping for this category of persons. border guard training : the proposal provides measures to improve training of border guards in order to detect situations of particular vulnerability involving unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking (article 15). rescue services : in order to allow for derogations related to the entry and exit of members of rescue services, police and fire brigades acting in emergency situations an express legal framework is required (addition of a new category in article 19, accompanied by related provisions in annex vii) including the possibility to conclude bilateral agreements on this issue. in addition, a special exemption is made for offshore workers (such as workers on oil-platforms or on maritime windparks) in annex vii, point 8, providing for rules comparable to coastal fishing. checks within the territory : many member states do not implement article 22 of the schengen implementing convention (reporting obligation for legally staying third-country nationals entering other member states). practical difficulties in verifying compliance with this general reporting obligation are broadly acknowledged and no convincing cost/benefit argument could be made to show that this rule has a significant impact on identifying illegally staying immigrants. the recent commission report on the application of title iii (internal borders) of the schengen borders code therefore proposed repealing article 22 schengen implementing convention as well as the corresponding reference to it in article 21(d) schengen borders code. the proposed amendment does not affect the right of member states to provide for targeted checks to fight illegal immigration in their territory. delegated acts : in order to align the provisions of the schengen borders with the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu), the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in respect of the adoption of additional measures governing surveillance as well as amendments to the annexes. reporting obligations : alignment of reporting obligations, expressly obliging member states to inform the commission of all bilateral agreements authorised by the schengen borders code. an explicit legal framework for joint border crossings (annex vi) : in order to enable bilateral agreements to be concluded between member states and neighbouring third countries on cooperation in border control with joint border crossing points, annex vi of the schengen borders code needs to be amended to expressly permit bilateral agreements for joint border checks on road traffic and to provide a legal framework on certain key issues, such as the situation of persons requesting international protection. amendments to the annexes : a number of technical amendments have been made to the annexes. repealing certain articles of the convention : the rules relating to border checks have been harmonised by eu law. this affects the power of member states to conclude treaties in this field. the conclusion of bilateral agreements between a member state and a third country on border checks without specific permission to do so in the schengen borders code would affect eu law within the meaning of article 3(2) tfeu and article 2(1) tfeu. article 136 of the convention implementing the schengen agreement is incompatible with this principle. it should therefore be repealed it should be noted that throughout the text, a certain number of changes resulting from the entry into force of the lisbon treaty are proposed (‘eu’ instead of ‘ec’). budgetary implications: this proposal has no implications for the eu budget."

(1) the commission should be empowered to adopt delegated acts concerning: the division of regions into geographical areas; the amending of the rules for the use of mesh size combinations; the establishment of rules for obtaining the percentage of target species taken by more than one fishing vessel in order to ensure that such catch compositions are respected by all the vessels involved in the fishing operation; the drawing up of rules concerning the technical descriptions and method of use of authorised devices that might be attached to the fishing net, and which do not obstruct or diminish the effective mesh opening of the net; conditions under which vessels exceeding eight meters length overall shall be permitted to use beam trawls within certain waters of the union; measures designed to address unexpectedly small or large recruitments of juveniles, changes in migration patterns or any other changes in the conservation status of fish stocks, with immediate effect. (2) likewise, the commission should be empowered to adopt implementing acts concerning: technical rules for measuring mesh sizes; square-meshed netting and twine thickness; technical rules related to the construction of netting materials; listing of devices that may obstruct or otherwise diminish the effective mesh opening in a fishing net; transmission of lists of vessels to which a special fishing permit to use beam trawls has been issued; technical rules related to measuring engine power and gear dimensions; the obligation of member states to ensure that levels of fishing effort are not exceeded in certain areas of ices division ixa, and temporary measures where the conservation of stocks of marine organisms calls for immediate action. the implementing powers conferred upon the commission, except those concerning the obligation of member states to ensure that levels of fishing effort are not exceeded in certain areas of ices division ixa, should be exercised in accordance with regulation (eu) no 182/2011 of the european parliament and of the council. budgetary impact: this measure does not involve any additional union expenditure."

to establish common rules and procedures for the implementation of the union's instruments for external action for 2014-2020. philosophy and action plan for external aid 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the eu can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of eu citizens. it is therefore in the interest of the eu to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. the lisbon treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the eu’s relations with the rest of the world. the eu's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the eu. in general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the eu's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the eu to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. a major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. the commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next mff period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. the commission proposes to allocate eur 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: financing instrument for development cooperation partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries instrument for pre-accession assistance (ipa ii) european neighbourhood instrument instrument for nuclear safety cooperation instrument for stability financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide in parallel and for the first time, the commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the union’s instruments for external action. this is the purpose of the present proposal. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: a priority for the commission within the context of the multiannual financial framework (mff) is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate the availability of union assistance to partner countries and regions, civil society organisations, smes, etc. to the extent that they contribute to the objectives of the regulation. in the implementation of the new instruments, simplified and flexible decision-making procedures would allow a swifter adoption of implementing measures and thus of delivery of eu assistance, in particular for countries in crisis, post-crisis and fragility. furthermore, the revision of the financial regulation, which is particularly substantial with regard to the special provision on external actions, will facilitate the participation of civil society organisations and small businesses in funding programmes, for example by simplifying rules, reducing the costs of participation and accelerating award procedures. the commission intends to implement this regulation using the new flexible procedures provided for in the new financial regulation. impact assessment: the commission performed an internal review of different reports (evaluations, audits, studies, mid-term reviews). the review looked at what worked and what did not work, and drew lessons for the drafting of the financial instruments. the review showed that the current instruments contributed to progress towards the mdgs in developing countries. the implementation modalities, such as budget support and the ""sectorwide approach"", have allowed deeper cooperation with partner countries and a more efficient division of labour through co-financing between donors. nevertheless, the review identified a number of shortcomings. the current implementation process was assessed as too complex and does not allow swift adjustments if required. these shortcomings have been directly addressed in the present regulation. legal basis: article 209(1) and 212 (2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: the commission proposes set of simplified rules and conditions for providing the union's financial assistance to actions, including action programmes and other measures, under the following instruments: the development cooperation instrument (‘dci’), the european instrument for democracy and human rights (‘eidhr’), the european neighbourhood instrument (‘eni’), the instrument for stability (‘ifs’), the instrument for nuclear safety cooperation (‘insc’), the instrument for pre-accession assistance (‘ipa’) and the partnership instrument (‘pi’). the proposal sets out the objectives of the regulation which are to provide a harmonised set of implementing rules for relex instruments, to protect the financial interests of the union, and to promote simplification and flexibility in implementing these instruments. adoption of action programmes, individual measures and special measures : the proposal provides that financing decisions taken by the commission are to be in the form of action programmes, based on the multiannual programming documents. exceptionally , individual measures can be adopted outside the action-programme framework. in the event of unforeseen and duly justified cases, the commission may adopt special measures not provided for in the multiannual programming documents. support measures : the proposal defines the types of expenditure that represent support to the implementation of this regulation and which may be covered by union financing (e.g. preparation, follow up, monitoring, audit and evaluation activities, provision of information and communication efforts). these measures can be financed outside the scope of the programming documents. provisions on the financing methods : the union's financial assistance may be provided, inter alia, through the following types of financing envisaged by the financial regulation: grants; procurement contracts for services, supplies or works; budget support; contributions to trust funds set up by the commission; financial instruments such as loans, guarantees, equity or quasi-equity, investments or participations, and risk-sharing instruments, possibly combined with grants; shareholdings or equity participations in international financial institutions, including regional development banks. the union's financial assistance may also be provided, in accordance with the financial regulation, through contributions to international, regional or national funds, such as those established or managed by the european investment bank, international organisations, member states or by partner countries and regions, for attracting joint financing from a number of donors, or to funds set up by one or more donors for the purpose of the joint implementation of projects. implementing tasks : the union's financial assistance shall be implemented by the commission as provided for by the financial regulation, directly by commission departments, union delegations and by executive agencies, or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to the entities listed in the financial regulation, including under shared management with member states. technical measures : the proposal also provides for innovative instruments, such as loans, guarantees, equity and risk-sharing instruments, and describes possible arrangements with respect to taxes, duties and charges. it describes that the measures under this regulations may be implemented directly by the commission or indirectly by entrusting budget implementation tasks to any entity or person listed in the financial regulation. this provision also defines the type of co-financing (parallel or joint). it also lays down measures to protect the union's financial interests, and in particular to enable it (notably the commission, the court of auditors and olaf) to carry out all the necessary checks on the measures implemented as well as conditions governing access to public procurement and grant awards for the purposes of implementing the regulation. the proposed provisions are significantly simplified and indicate the objective to work towards untied aid delivery. nevertheless, the articles introduce in detail the conditions for eligibility of third countries (reciprocity requirement, participation in the implemented programme, non-eligibility of certain countries, etc.) and exceptions thereto (unavailability of products or services provided, extreme urgency, triangular cooperation, etc.). evaluation and implementation report : the commission should regularly evaluate the results of the implemented policies and programmes, sectoral policies and the effectiveness of programming itself. all relevant stakeholders will be associated to the evaluation and the report will be shared with the council and the european parliament. no later than 31 december 2017, a report shall be established by the commission on the achievement of the objectives of each of the instruments by means of result and impact indicators measuring the efficiency of the use of resources and the european added value of the instruments, in view of a decision on the renewal, modification or suspension of the types of actions implemented under the instruments. the commission shall examine the progress made in implementing the measures of financial assistance taken in external action and shall submit to the european parliament and to the council a report every two years starting in 2016 on the implementation and results and, as far as possible, on the main outcomes and impacts of the union's financial assistance. specific tracking system based on the oecd methodology (‘rio markers’) is proposed. by mid 2018, the commission shall prepare and submit a report evaluating the implementation of this regulation to the european parliament and the council, and, if appropriate, present a legislative proposal introducing the necessary modifications. likewise, this report will assess the impact of the measures adopted on the basis of this regulation. comitology : the proposal describes the involvement of the relevant committees in the implementation of this regulation. budgetary implications: the proposal has no implications for the eu’s budget."

complexity and length of the programming process; scope of the instrument; partly outdated implementation provisions and lack of coherence between the external instruments; cross-border cooperation (cbc) provisions; linkages with internal instruments/policies; evolving relationship with russia. the future european neighbourhood instrument should be aligned to the new enp vision and address the specific challenges and issues as identified above. impact assessment: the impact assessment reviewed the following four options: option 0 : ‘no eu action’. the eu stops providing financial support through a dedicated instrument for neighbourhood countries; option 1 : ‘no change’. cooperation with the countries concerned remains strictly in the framework of the existing enpi regulation; option 2 : ‘adapting the current set-up’. the future legislative proposal should be based on the current enpi regulation with a number of substantial amendments, responding to the new policy context and specific objectives. under this option there are a number of sub-options referring to: the differentiation principle; the programming process; scope of the instrument and coherence between policy and assistance; cross-border cooperation rules; implementation provision, notably to allow for greater flexibility; linkages with internal policies and instruments and geographic scope of the eni. option 3 : ‘tabling a completely new instrument’ with a different geographic scope and focussing on objectives broader than or different from those of the enp. based on the analysis, option 2 would have the highest potential to yield a positive impact and to adapt the current cooperation framework to the new policy context, enp objectives and challenges identified through evaluations and lessons learned. legal basis: article 209(1) and article 212(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: with this proposed regulation, the commission proposes to establish assistance to the partner countries listed below with the aim of establishing an area of prosperity and good neighbourliness at the eu’s borders. partner countries : as well as russia in accordance with specific provisions. specific objectives of union’s support : support under this regulation shall promote enhanced political cooperation and progressive economic integration between the union and the partner countries and, in particular, the implementation of partnership and cooperation agreements, association agreements or other existing and future agreements, and jointly agreed action plans. union support should target in particular: promoting human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law, principles of equality, establishing deep and sustainable democracy, promoting good governance and developing a thriving civil society including social partners; achieving progressive integration into the union internal market and enhanced sector and cross-sectoral co-operation including through legislative approximation and regulatory convergence towards union and other relevant international standards, related institution building and investments, notably in interconnections; creating conditions for well managed mobility of people and promotion of people-to-people contacts; sustainable and inclusive development in all aspects, poverty reduction, including through private-sector development; promotion of internal economic, social and territorial cohesion, rural development, climate action and disaster resilience; promoting confidence building and other measures contributing to security and the prevention and settlement of conflicts; enhancing sub-regional, regional and neighbourhood wide collaboration as well as cross-border cooperation. union support may also be used in other areas when this is consistent with the overall objectives of the european neighbourhood policy. the achievement of these objectives shall be measured using notably the relevant eu periodic reports on the implementation of the policy and the relevant indicators established by international organisations and other relevant bodies. framework strategy : the key elements of the proposal (as compared to the current set-up) and their rationale are the following: pply the principle of “more for more” and mutual accountability in line with the new vision of the enp, notably through specific provisions on differentiation for financial allocations and for the programming process, as required; address the complexity and length of the programming process in order to streamline, shorten and better focus the process, especially for enp partners that have jointly agreed with the eu strategic priorities in action plans or equivalent documents; streamline the scope of the instrument , striking a balance between flexibility of the instrument and focus on the policy objectives and key areas of cooperation; adapt the implementation provisions and improve coherence between the external instruments; improve the provisions on the cross-border cooperation to facilitate effective and fast implementation of the programmes; promote closer links with eu internal instruments and policies, including by stepping up cooperation with the commission at the programming stage and, where relevant, promote mechanisms to pool funds from internal and external headings of the eu budget; respond to the evolving relationship with russia by amending provisions on russia’s eligibility for eni funding to reflect the specific status of russia as an eu neighbour and strategic partner. strategic framework and indicative programming : the scope of the instrument has been streamlined by bringing down the 29 thematic areas that feature in the current enpi regulation to six specific objectives. a new, simplified programming tool for most of the neighbouring countries (single support framework) has been introduced. this new programming document will be shorter than the strategy papers and multiannual indicative programmes, will prevent duplication of information contained in the legal/political documents that underpin eu relations with its neighbours, and should help shorten the programming process, therefore reducing administrative costs. the new article that allows funds from the eni and the relevant internal heading of the eu budget to be pooled with a single set of rules for measures addressing notably cross-border challenges will substantially improve efficiency and reduce the administrative costs of implementing such measures. simplified implementation : t o implement the new eni regulation, simplified and flexible procedures should lead to swifter adoption of implementing measures and swifter delivery of eu assistance, in particular in situations of crises or threats to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, or natural or man-made disasters. revision of the financial regulation, which has particularly substantial provisions on external action, will also help facilitate the participation of civil society organisations and small businesses in funding programmes. the commission intends to implement this regulation using the new flexible procedures provided for in the new financial regulation. furthermore additional simplification will also be achieved through the development of one horizontal framework regulation comprising all general and recurring provisions, providing for increased coherence between the external actions instruments. coherence and complementarity : in implementing this regulation, coherence shall be ensured with other areas of the union external action as well as other relevant union policies. other measures are provided to ensure donor coordination. budgetary implications: the european commission in its communication of 29 june 2011 entitled “a budget for europe 2020” proposed allocating to the eni eur 18 182 300 000 (current prices) for the period 2014-2020. delegated acts: delegated powers to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty of the functioning of the european union should be conferred to the commission for adopting the specific implementing measures required for the cross-border cooperation mechanisms established in title iii of this regulation. the commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should further ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and council. in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the commission. taking into account the nature of those implementing acts, in particular their policy orientation nature or their financial implications, the examination procedure should in principle be used for their adoption, except for measures of a small financial scale."

to establish a new instrument for pre-accession (ipa ii) 2014-2020 in the framework of the reform of the eu external action financial instruments and following on from the unified instrument for pre-accession assistance (ipa) for the potential candidate countries to accession, financial perspective from 2007 to 2013. philosophy and action plan for external aid 2014-2020: what happens outside the borders of the eu can and does directly affect the prosperity and security of eu citizens. it is therefore in the interest of the eu to be actively engaged in influencing the world around us, including through the use of financial instruments. the lisbon treaty marks, in this regard, a new departure in the eu’s relations with the rest of the world. the eu's engagement needs to be tailored to individual circumstances. its partners range from development economies to the least developed countries in need of specific assistance from the eu. in general, the overall objective for external action for the period 2014-2020 may be summarised as follows: long-term commitment to establishing an area of stability, prosperity and democracy in its own neighbourhood; facilitating the eu's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the eu to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. a major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. the commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next mff period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. the commission proposes to allocate eur 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: financing instrument for development cooperation partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries this instrument for pre-accession assistance (ipa ii) european neighbourhood instrument instrument for nuclear safety cooperation instrument for stability financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide in parallel and for the first time, the commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the union’s instruments for external action. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: f or the past 50 years the eu has simultaneously pursued integration and enlargement, increasing from 6 to the present 27 member states and from a population of less than 200 million to more than 500 million people. a review, five years after the fifth enlargement of the eu in 2004, concluded that: the latest enlargements had brought greater prosperity for all eu citizens and made europe a stronger player in the world economy. currently, the eu is dealing with 5 candidate countries (croatia, the former yugoslav republic of macedonia, iceland, montenegro and turkey) and 4 potential candidates (albania, bosnia and herzegovina, serbia as well as kosovo). by 2014, only croatia is foreseen to become a member state. socio-economic indicators show that, with the exception of iceland, enlargement countries are still well below the eu average and even below the level of the weakest member states. this low level of socio-economic development calls for substantial investments to bring these countries closer to eu standards and allow them to take on board the obligations of membership and to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market. in addition, the countries in the western balkans are still relatively young states where political stability and the full establishment of the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and good governance — all fundamental values of the eu — still need to be strengthened. these countries cannot sustain alone all the efforts and cost of meeting the criteria for joining the eu. technical and financial assistance to the enlargement countries is currently provided through the instrument for pre-accession assistance (ipa) which will expire at the end of 2013. with a view to future accessions, the eu should continue to offer candidate countries and potential candidates technical and financial assistance to overcome their difficult situation and develop sustainably by concentrating on the following elements: promote stability, security and prosperity in europe; continue to pursue the general policy objective of supporting candidate countries and potential candidates in their preparations for eu membership and the progressive alignment of their institutions and economies with the standards and policies of the european union; strengthen the coherence between the financial assistance and the overall progress made in the implementation of the pre-accession strategy; operate more flexibly and to leverage more funds from other donors or the private sector by using innovative financing instruments, pursue simplification and reduction of the administrative burden linked to managing the financial assistance. impact assessment: the impact assessment examined three options: sub-option 2.1 : ‘reduce scope and keep implementation arrangements’, focusing on the necessary legal and institutional changes needed to comply with the accession criteria, without committing any significant funds for co-financing public investment for socio-economic development. sub-option 2.2 : ‘keep the component structure and add more focus on investments’ in order to increase the socio-economic impact in the beneficiary countries and to speed up their preparation for managing structural, cohesion and rural development funds. sub-option 2.3 : ‘maintain the scope and adjust implementation arrangements’, covering both compliance with the accession criteria and support for socio-economic development. in addition, adjust aspects of the current ipa set-up and implementation modalities. the improved modalities for delivering assistance under option 2.3, by increasing its focus, efficiency, effectiveness, leverage and impact, were assessed as likely to have overall a more positive impact than the increased investments in socio-economic development under option 2.2. option 2.3 is therefore the preferred option. content: with this proposed regulation, the commission proposes to establish an instrument for pre–accession assistance (‘ipa’) aims to support candidate countries and potential candidates listed in the annex in implementing the political, institutional, legal, administrative, social and economic reforms required to bring the countries closer to union values and to progressively align to union rules, standards, policies and practices with a view to union membership. specific objectives : assistance under this regulation shall pursue the following specific objectives according to the needs of each beneficiary country and their individual enlargement agenda: support for political reforms , inter alia: (i). strengthening of democratic institutions and the rule of law, including its implementation; (ii). promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms, enhanced respect for minority rights, promotion of gender equality, non-discrimination and freedom of the press, and promotion of good neighbourly relations; (iii). the fight against corruption and organised crime; (iv). public administration reform and good governance; (v). the development of civil society and social dialogue; (vi). reconciliation, peace building and confidence building measures; support for economic, social and territorial development , with a view to a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, inter alia through: (i). the achievement of union standards in the economy and economic governance; (ii) economic reforms necessary to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union, while pursuing economic, social and environmental goals; (iii). fostering employment and developing human capital; (iv). social and economic inclusion, in particular of minorities and vulnerable groups; (v). development of physical capital, the improvement of connections with union and regional networks; strengthening of the ability of beneficiary countries to fulfil the obligations stemming from membership by supporting progressive alignment with and adoption, implementation and enforcement of the acquis communautaire, structural, cohesion, agricultural and rural development funds and policies of the union. regional integration and territorial cooperation involving beneficiary countries, member states and, where appropriate, third countries within the scope of regulation establishing a european neighbourhood instrument. progress towards achievement of the specific objectives set out above shall be assessed through indicators laid down in the proposal. the indicators shall be used for monitoring, evaluation and review of performance, as appropriate. countries concerned: albania bosnia and herzegovina iceland kosovo montenegro serbia turkey the former yugoslav republic of macedonia strategic planning t he delivery of assistance will be made more coherent, strategic and result-oriented , by: addressing policy areas through comprehensive multi-annual country (and multi-beneficiary) strategy papers reflecting the political priorities of the enlargement strategy and covering, for each policy area, all necessary institution building, acquis compliance and investment actions. the scope will be based on a needs assessment and will be adapted to the country context. reinforcing (co-)financing of agreed sector strategies contributing to the policy objectives, as opposed to individual projects, thus moving away from purely grantfinanced projects and increasing the share of assistance funded through support at sector level (including sector budget support for selected policy areas based on effectively targeted conditionalities). nevertheless, support for acquis compliance will remain available through project support or other implementation modalities such as dedicated facilities, when not covered by overarching sector strategies. more systematic multi-annual programming also for policy objectives pursued by transition and institution-building assistance (e.g. public administration reform; reform of justice systems, etc.), supporting effective implementation of the related sector strategies and ultimately attainment of the related objectives. making financial assistance more directly conditional on improved governance and growing ownership by the beneficiary countries. elements of flexibility will be introduced to cater for emerging needs and give incentives to improve performance. the delivery of assistance will be made more flexible and tailored to address needs, by : allowing un-differentiated access to assistance (irrespective of candidate or potential candidate status), albeit with a different scope or intensity, on the basis of needs and technical and administrative capacity. the needs of the beneficiary countries would be the starting point for determining the sectors/policy areas for assistance. envisaging a more progressive, phased approach to the management of financial assistance, whereby management would be by the commission or by the beneficiary country, with or without ex-ante controls by the commission, depending on accession status/perspective, sector/policy area of assistance, and administrative, technical and management capacity. the creation of management structures and procedures mirroring those that need to be in place post-accession would continue to be the aim in relevant sectors in preparation for accession. linking progress along different management phases to political priorities , as reflected in progress reports, the achievement of negotiation benchmarks or the track record in implementing the association agreements. increasing flexibility between priorities for a more result-oriented delivery of the assistance , allowing allocations to be transferred between policy areas, with the possibility to carry over funds from one year to another, where allowed by the new financial regulation. indicative programming : the proposal also envisages that strategic decisions on the allocation of assistance are made through comprehensive country and multi-country strategy papers covering the full period of the new financial framework (2014-2020) and reviewed once at mid-term, replacing the current system of three-year rolling indicative planning documents revised each year. this will reduce, for all stakeholders involved, the administrative burden related to the yearly review of each document and possible ensuing revisions. similarly, less administration for all and quicker delivery of assistance will follow from introducing multi-annual programming for transition and capacity-building assistance as well. simplified implementation : a priority for the commission in this new regulation, as in other programmes under the multiannual financial framework (mff), is to simplify the regulatory environment and facilitate union assistance to beneficiary countries and regions, civil society organisations, smes, etc. this proposal pursues simplification primarily by streamlining the component structure around principal policy areas. this translates into simplification of the legislative framework for the instrument and the future implementing rules, with streamlined provisions. simplification and flexible procedures in the implementation of the new regulation, will allow swifter adoption of implementing measures and delivery of eu assistance. in implementing this regulation, the commission will use the simplified procedures provided for in the new financial regulation. different commission services will remain responsible for managing and implementing the assistance in the different policy areas. however, coordination, communication and implementation on the ground will be further improved through simplification of a number of aspects, including closer joint monitoring of the progress of implementation in the beneficiary countries and fewer processes for accreditation and conferral of management powers. beneficiary’s change of status : it will no longer be necessary to go through a cumbersome procedure to reflect a beneficiary’s change of status, thus reducing the gap between the political decisions on financial assistance and implementation on the ground. similarly, should a new country become a potential candidate for eu accession, the procedural requirements for including that country among the beneficiaries of assistance would be considerably simplified. coherence and complementarity : increasing the coherence of action by the commission should also substantially reduce the cost and burden of coordination incurred by beneficiary countries, on account of the different communication channels and procedures used by the commission. follow-up and evaluation : detailed provisions on joint monitoring and the accreditation processes will be set out in separate implementing rules. budgetary implications: in its communication on ‘a budget for europe 2020’, the european commission proposed to allocate an amount of eur 14 110 100 000 (current prices) to the new instrument for pre-accession assistance for the period 2014-2020. delegated acts: considering that the discretionary policy decisions on the status of applicant countries should be taken at another level, it is proposed that amendments made to the list of beneficiary countries in annex to the proposed regulation to reflect such decisions should be adopted by way of a delegated act in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union, since such amendments will not actually affect an essential element of the regulation. it is also proposed that the commission should be conferred delegated powers to adopt detailed rules establishing uniform conditions for implementing the proposed regulation, in particular as regards management structures and procedures. such rules are needed to complement the common rules and procedures for the implementation of the union's instruments for external action established by the common implementing regulation. they should take into account the lessons learnt from the management and implementation of past pre-accession assistance and be adapted to the evolution of the situation in the beneficiary countries."

a new financial instrument is needed for the period 2014-2020. moreover, since the ici regulation entered into force, the eu has seen in particular the emergence of economies such as india, china and brazil which are playing an increasingly prominent role in the international economy and trade, in multilateral fora (un and g20) and in addressing challenges of global concern. while development and poverty alleviation remain a key concern, these countries are o developed broad based agreements with key partners and emerging economies to address bilateral issues and matters of global concern. implementation of these instruments (i.e.: as agreements, declarations, action plans etc) requires a dedicated financing instrument so that the eu has the means to promote its interests effectively worldwide and to deal with global issues wherever the need arises. the eu does not currently possess a genuine instrument that would allow it to co-operate with new emerging economies on issues related to advancing core eu interests and on common challenges of global concern (such as climate change for instance or the need to promote sustainable development at all levels). the proposed partnership instrument is designed to overcome this limitation of the eu’s ability to engage internationally in the most effective way. it would fill the gap described above and, in particular, allow the eu to pursue agendas beyond development cooperation with global players, but also to defend core eu interests with any other partner country as the need arises. it could also underpin new relationships with countries graduating from bilateral development assistance. impact assessment: the commission examined 4 policy options: option 0 : “zero option”: this implies that assistance under the current ici instrument would be phased out as of 31 december 2013. option 1 : “no change”: maintaining the status quo, the ici regulation would cover only traditional industrialised and high- income countries (.i.e. 17 countries) and the dci regulation would remain the only financial instrument, focused on development cooperation, to cover cooperation with some countries of great importance in terms of economics, demographics, and politics. option 2 : “maintain ici as such and amend dci”: this option would maintain the ici in its current form and insert a window for economic, financial and technical cooperation of a non developmental nature with third countries within the dci. option 3 : “table a new instrument building on ici/ici+”: this option would build on the ici and ici+ proposal to provide a new instrument with a global reach. after careful evaluation, neither discontinuing the ici nor maintaining the status quo were deemed to be politically viable solutions. limiting expenditure exclusively to action linked to poverty alleviation or maintaining this sole focus for cooperation with emerging economies would artificially limit the eu’s external action and neglect core eu interests. the option of amending the development cooperation instrument to allow expenditure not related to official development assistance would have the advantage of geographical coherence (one instrument per country), but the difficulties of managing an instrument with two very different objectives were considered a serious handicap. by process of elimination, the preferred option is that of creating a new instrument with a global reach (option 3) as this would allow for a clear distinction with development cooperation money and respect the commission’s intention to increase coherence and consistency through a major simplification of the instruments. legal basis: articles 207(2), 209(1) and 212(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: the proposed r egulation aims to establish a partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries to advance and promote eu and mutual interests. the partnership instrument shall support measures that respond in an effective and flexible manner to objectives arising from the union's bilateral, regional or multilateral relationships with third countries and address challenges of global concern. specific objectives : the measures to be financed under this instrument shall reflect the following specific union objectives: implementing the international dimension of the “europe 2020” strategy by supporting union’s bilateral, regional and inter-regional cooperation partnership strategies, by promoting policy dialogues and by developing collective approaches and responses to challenges of global concern such as energy security, climate change and environment. this objective shall be measured by the uptake of the “europe 2020” policies and objectives by key partner countries; improving market access and developing trade, investment and business opportunities for european companies by means of economic partnerships and business and regulatory cooperation. this objective shall be measured by the union’s share in foreign trade with key partner countries and by trade and investments flows to partner countries specifically targeted by actions, programmes and measures under this regulation; enhancing widespread understanding and visibility of the union and its role on the world scene by means of public diplomacy, education/academic cooperation and outreach activities to promote union’s values and interests. general principles : to promote, develop and consolidate the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law on which it is founded by means of dialogue and cooperation with third countries; to enhance the impact of the union’s assistance, a differentiated and flexible approach shall be pursued, where appropriate, in designing cooperation with partner countries to take account of their economic, social and political contexts as and also of the union’s specific interests, policy priorities and strategies; to promote a multilateral approach to global challenges and shall foster cooperation with international or regional organisations and bodies, including international financial institutions, united nations agencies, funds and programmes, oecd, and the group of twenty finance ministers and central bank governors (g20) and other bilateral donors; to ensure coherence and consistency with other areas of its external action, in particular the development cooperation instrument for developing countries, and with other relevant union’s policies when formulating policy, strategic planning and programming and implementing measures; to defend the union’s specific interests, policy priorities and strategies. third countries concerned : a ll third countries, regions and territories may be eligible for cooperation under this regulation. however, this regulation shall primarily support cooperation measures with developed and developing countries which play an increasingly prominent role in the international economy and trade, in multilateral fora, in global governance and in addressing challenges of global concern and where the union has significant interests. areas of cooperation : detailed areas of cooperation to be pursued by the union’s assistance under this regulation are listed in the annex. the commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend or supplement the annex. programming and indicative allocation of funds : the multi-annual indicative programmes shall set out the union’s strategic and/or mutual interests and priorities, the specific objectives and expected results. for countries or regions for which a joint framework document, laying down a comprehensive union strategy has been established, the multi-annual indicative programmes shall be based on this document. the multiannual indicative programmes shall also set out the priority areas selected for financing by the union and shall outline the indicative financial allocation of funds. coherence and complementarity : coherence and complementarity with other external action geographical instruments, in particular the development cooperation instrument, will be taken into account throughout the programming stage while integrating the principles of differentiation and concentration. implementation : the implementation has been greatly simplified as an article stipulates that the decision shall be implemented in accordance with the future regulation establishing common implementation rules for external relations financing instruments. budgetary implications: the european commission in its communication of 29 june 2011 entitled “a budget for europe 2020” proposed allocating to the partnership instrument a total amount of eur 1 131 million, at current prices, over the period 2014-2020. delegated acts: in order to adapt the scope of this regulation to the rapidly evolving reality in third countries, the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty of the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission in respect of the detailed areas of cooperation defined in the annex. it is of particular importance that the commission should carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, including at expert level. the commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council."

facilitating the eu's engagement with third countries on issues that are of global concern, such as climate change, environmental protection, irregular migration and regional instabilities, and allowing the eu to respond rapidly and effectively to natural and manmade disasters around the world. a major rationalisation of the instruments took place in 2003 and has begun to deliver more effective results. the commission does not consider that another major alteration of the legislative architecture is necessary for the next mff period, although some improvements are being proposed and the overall investment is being stepped up. the commission proposes to allocate eur 70 billion for the 2014-2020 period for external instruments broken down as follows: the present financing instrument for development cooperation partnership instrument for cooperation with third countries instrument for pre-accession assistance (ipa ii) european neighbourhood instrument instrument for nuclear safety cooperation instrument for stability instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide. in parallel and for the first time, the commission proposes a single horizontal regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the union’s instruments for external action. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: the number of people living in poverty continues to be a major problem in developing countries. while significant progress has been achieved, most developing countries remain off-track for the achievement of the millennium development goals (mdgs) and are not able to successfully embark on the path of sustainable development in all its senses. to aggravate the situation, global challenges continue to be prominent and developing countries were hit hard by the succession of recent crises resulting inter alia in social and economic instability, increased migration, food insecurity and an increased vulnerability to external shocks, among other effects. it is increasingly recognised that environmental and natural resources, vital for sustainable socio-economic growth, are increasingly at risk from climate change and rapid population growth. the eu remains committed to helping developing countries to reduce and ultimately eradicate poverty. to achieve this objective, the development cooperation instrument (dci) regulation was established for the 2007-2013 period with the primary and overarching objective of eradicating poverty in partner countries and regions. this instrument consists of three categories of programmes: i) bilateral and regional geographic programmes covering cooperation with asia, latin america, central asia, the middle east and south africa ; ii) thematic programmes covering the following issues: investing in people, environment and sustainable management of natural resources including energy, non-state actors and local authorities, food security, and migration and asylum; and iii) accompanying measures for sugar-producing countries. the current dci regulation expires on 31 december 2013. the various reviews undertaken of the dci have acknowledged its overall added value and its contribution to the achievement of the mdgs, but have also highlighted certain shortcomings. new challenges, together with the priorities set out in the europe 2020 strategy and the latest eu development policy, have prompted the commission to make a proposal to review and adapt the dci regulation in line with the 2011 communication ""increasing the impact of eu development policy: an agenda for change"". impact assessment: the commission carried out an impact assessment (ia) that considered 3 basic policy alternatives: option 1 : maintaining the dci regulation without any amendment and option 2 : two alternatives for amending the dci on each problem identified in the current dci (options 2a and 2b). option 1 was not accepted because it would not solve the problems identified. sub-options a and b under option 2 solve the identified problems to different extents, each having particular political and other implications. the ia concluded that sub-option b is better as it differentiates clearly amongst partner countries and it streamlines the thematic programmes to provide the necessary flexibility to facilitate a more effective eu response to rapidly evolving situations in crisis, post-crisis and fragile states. legal basis: article 209 (1) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: with this proposal, the commission establishes an instrument designed to finance: geographic programmes aimed at supporting cooperation with developing countries, territories and regions set out in the annex to the regulation (46 countries are concerned), which are included in the list of recipients of official development assistance (oda) of the oecd/dac; thematic programmes to address global public goods and challenges and support civil society organisations and local authorities in countries, territories and regions eligible for union funding under the european neighbourhood instrument, and acp countries signatories to the cotonou agreement; a pan-african programme to support the joint africa-eu strategy in the countries, territories and regions covered by that strategy. objectives and eligibility criteria : the regulation lays down the objectives and eligibility criteria for dci ii, as well as the eu’s development cooperation geographic and thematic programmes. the proposed regulation thus provides for the support of all forms of cooperation in developing countries. it requires fulfilling the criteria for oda, subject to possible exceptions for the thematic and pan-african programmes. for these programmes, a 10% flexibility for non-oda activities is foreseen to cover for expenditure which; although not strictly speaking oda-compliant, may be required for the adequate implementation of actions under these programmes. general principles: the proposal sets out the main principles governing the implementation of the regulation, which are: democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law; differentiated approach towards the partner countries, taking into account their needs, capacities, commitments and performance, and potential eu impact; key cross-cutting issues (such as gender equality and women empowerment); strengthened coherence of eu external action; improved coordination with the member states and other bilateral or multilateral donors; and a partner country-led and region-led development process with mutual accountability, through an inclusive and participatory approach to development, using effective and innovative cooperation modalities thus improving the impact of aid and reducing overlap and duplication. geographic and thematic programmes : the regulation lays down the guiding principles: for the thematic programmes by means of which the eu assistance will be provided; the possible areas for cooperation and distinguishes between regional and bilateral cooperation. differentiation : the principle of differentiation will be applied as often as possible. as a consequence, bilateral development assistance would be provided to those partner countries which need it the most, and lack the required financial capacities for their own development. also, the differentiation principle takes into account the potential impact of the union assistance in partner countries. partner countries that shall benefit from bilateral development assistance are listed in the annex to the regulation. this annex does not include countries ""graduated"" according to the following criteria: partner countries representing more than 1% of the world's gdp and/or upper middle income countries according to the list of recipients of oda are in principle excluded. however, additional criteria relating to their need and capacity are used, such as human development index, the economic vulnerability index and aid dependency, as well as economic growth and foreign direct investment. also the reliability of the available data is taken into consideration. all partner countries, however, would still benefit from regional and thematic programmes. areas of intervention : the regulation does not restrict the areas of eu cooperation or intervention. any listing of such areas is purely illustrative. areas may be chosen because they are pertinent to achieving the aims laid down in the treaty, to the eu's international obligations and commitments or to the specific objectives provided for in the agreements with partner countries and regions. they should nevertheless be proposed with reference to the eu's objective of concentrating assistance, with a view to ensuring that the eu's policy and the policies of the member states complement each other thematic programmes : actions undertaken within thematic programmes bring an added value to actions financed under the geographic programmes. the characteristics of thematic programmes may be summarised as follows: global public goods and challenges : these actions will target the main global goods and challenges in a flexible and cross cutting manner. the main fields of activities that will be pursued by this programme include, inter alia, environment and climate change, sustainable energy, human development (including health, education, gender equality, employment, skills, social protection and social inclusion as well as economic development-related aspects such as growth, jobs, trade and private sector engagement), food security and migration and asylum. this thematic programme will enable swift response in view of unforeseen events and global crises (e.g. the food price crisis, avian flu). civil society organisations and local authorities: programme in favour of civil society organisations (csos) and local authorities (las) thematic which is based on the former non-state actors and local authorities programme. the focus of this programme has been sharpened with more attention given to capacity development of csos and las. the programme will promote an inclusive and empowered civil society and local authorities, increase awareness and mobilisation on development issues, and strengthen the capacity for policy dialogue on development. pan-african programme : the pan-african programme is being set up to implement the joint africa-eu strategy (jaes). it will be complementary and coherent with other financial instruments, notably the eni, the edf and the thematic programmes under dci. while eni and edf focus on interventions at the regional or national level in africa, the pan-african programme shall be used to provide specific support for the objectives of the jaes, supporting in particular activities of transregional, continental and trans-continental nature, as well as relevant jaes initiatives in the global arena. programming and allocation of funds : this article of the proposal lays down the general framework for geographical and thematic programming, as well as for the allocation of the funds under this regulation. to ensure synergies and complementarity of the union’s measures and those of the member states, the member states will be fully involved in the programming process. the consultation process will also include other donors and development actors as well as civil society and regional and local authorities. provision is, in particular, made for the following: programming documents for geographic programmes with an indicative allocation and multiannual indicative programmes. these also list exceptions for when a strategy paper would not need to be prepared in order to simplify the programming process as well as to favour joint programming with member states. the strategy papers will be drafted in dialogue with the partner countries and regions, with relevant involvement of the civil society and regional and local authorities; a joint framework document that would lay down a comprehensive union strategy, of which development policy would be part; multiannual indicative programmes (mip ) based on any programming documents, except when the total allocation would not exceed 30 million eur. mips can be adjusted through a mid term or ad hoc review, in view of achieved objectives as well as in light of newly identified needs, such as those resulting from crisis, post-crisis or fragility situations. flexibility : the draft regulation provides that a certain amount should not be allocated in order to increase the instrument’s flexibility and its ability to react to unexpected events (new priorities, natural or man-made disasters, etc.). other provisions are made for: programming for countries in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situation emphasising the special needs and circumstances of countries in crisis, post-crisis or fragility situation and providing for a special procedure in this case; programming documents for thematic programmes may undergo a mid-term review; approval of strategy papers and adoption of multiannual indicative programmes. coherence and complementarity : to make union assistance more coherent and effective, and in particular to avoid programmes being split up among several different instruments, the proposed regulation lays out the possibility to extend the eligibility of this regulation to include all third countries, territories and regions, insofar as this contributes to the general objectives of the regulation. implementation : implementation has been considerably simplified, with an article stipulating that the regulation shall be implemented in accordance with the future regulation establishing common rules and procedures for the implementation of the union’s instruments for external action. budgetary impact: in line with the multiannual financial framework for the period 2014-2020 establishing the budget for europe 2020, the commission proposes to allocate eur 23.2947 billion to this instrument for the period 2014-2020. it is planned that no less than 50% of the programme for global public goods and challenges will be spent on climate change and environmental objectives and at least 20% on social inclusion and human development. continued support for social inclusion and human development is foreseen through at least 20% of the union's development aid. lastly, this regulation intends to contribute to addressing at least 20% of the union's budget to creating low carbon and climate resilient societies. delegated acts: it is proposed that flexibility be reinforced by using delegated acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty to make it possible to amend certain non-essential elements of the regulation that affects the subsequent programming (e.g. annexes on eligible countries, areas for cooperation and indicative financial allocation per programme for 2014-2020)."

resolution,s,Moraes,A7-0428/2013,2010/0210/COD,http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=REPORT&reference=A7-2013-0428&language=EN,"Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home

to introduce a special procedure for third-country nationals applying to reside in the eu for seasonal employment, and to define the rights of seasonal workers. proposed act: directive of the european parliament and of the council. background: eu economies face a structural need for seasonal work for which labour from within the eu is expected to become less and less available. as regards future skills shortages, traditional sectors will continue to play an important role and the structural need for low-skilled and low-qualified workers is likely to continue expanding. it should also be pointed out that there is a more permanent need for unskilled labour within the eu. it is expected to be increasingly difficult to fill these gaps with eu national workers, primarily owing to the fact that these workers consider seasonal work unattractive. further, there is significant evidence that certain third-country seasonal workers face exploitation and sub-standard working conditions which may threaten their health and safety. lastly, sectors of the economy that are characterised by a strong presence of seasonal workers - most notably agriculture, horticulture and tourism - are repeatedly identified as the sectors most prone to work undertaken by third-country nationals who are staying illegally. the proposal is part of a comprehensive package of measures, proposed in the policy plan on legal migration of 2005 and further endorsed by the stockholm programme, adopted by the european council in december 2009. impact assessment : the following options were considered: option 1 - status quo. current developments in member states and at eu level would continue within the existing legal framework. employers will be under certain obligations resulting from the 2009 directive on employer sanctions as regards notifications to authorities and penalties in the case of illegal employment. the effect of this option would be limited. option 2 - directive on entry and residence conditions of seasonal workers and rights . common rules would be established, including the definition of seasonal work, and admission criteria. this would help to establish a common legal framework applicable to all employers in the eu and to prevent exploitation. however, seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex procedures for entry. option 3 - directive laying down common admission procedures . in addition to option 2, a single work and residence permit for third-country seasonal workers would be introduced, to be issued in a single procedure. provisions would be made for facilitating re-entry of a seasonal worker in subsequent seasons. hiring procedures would be more efficient, and a more predictable workforce would be available for eu employers. option 4 - directive on measures to ensure effective return . measures would include limitation of the length of stay, and an explicit obligation to return at the end of the period. overstaying of seasonal workers would be prevented to some extent. effects on the functioning of the eu labour market would be marginal. seasonal workers would still be faced with diverging and complex entry procedures. option 5 - communication, coordination and cooperation among member states . no new legislation would be introduced, but complementary and supporting activities would be undertaken with a view to approximating member states’ practices. effects would be limited, as the measures would not be binding; potential seasonal workers and their prospective employers would continue to face an array of different rules for admission and different rights would be granted to seasonal workers during their residence. the preferred option is a combination of options 2, 3 and 4. common admission standards with simplified entry procedures and the prospect of returning in a subsequent season (options 2 and 3) will provide for flexible admission to endow the eu labour market with the necessary resources. elements from option 4 should help ensure the return of the seasonal worker and thus prevent overstaying. legal base: article 79(2)(a) and (b) of the treaty on the functioning of the eu. content: the proposal establishes a fast-track procedure for the admission of third-country seasonal workers, based on a common definition and common criteria, in particular the existence of a work contract or a binding job offer that specifies a salary equal to or above a minimum level. seasonal workers will be issued with a residence permit allowing them to work for a specified maximum period per calendar year. provision is also made for facilitating the re-entry of a seasonal worker in a subsequent season. in order to prevent exploitation and protect the safety and health of third-country seasonal workers, legal provisions applying to working conditions are clearly defined. also, employers are required to provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have appropriate accommodation during his/her stay and that provision is made for facilitation of complaints. to prevent overstaying of third-country seasonal workers, a maximum duration of stay per calendar year is laid down as well as the explicit obligation to return after that period; there is no possibility of status change. the main provisions are as follows: chapter i: general provisions purpose :the purpose of the proposal is to introduce a special procedure for the entry and residence of third-country nationals applying to reside in the eu for seasonal employment, and to define the rights of seasonal workers. scope : the provisions only apply to third-country nationals who reside outside the territory of the member states. there is no provision for applications for employment as seasonal workers from within a member state. the proposal does not apply to third-country nationals posted by undertakings established in a member state in the framework of a provision of services in accordance with directive 96/71/ec. definitions : the notion of seasonal work is distinguished from regular, permanent work in particular by higher workforce requirements linked to an event or pattern of events, such as the planting or harvesting period in agriculture, or the holiday period in tourism including events, festivals, biennales or long term exhibitions in culture. member states may determine specific sectors of the economy that meet the criteria for seasonal work. more favourable provisions : the proposal allows member states to grant more favourable conditions only in relation to certain specific provisions that concern the procedural safeguards, the level of rights granted to seasonal workers, as well as provisions relating to accommodation and facilitation of complaints. chapter ii: admission criteria criteria for admission : the proposal sets out the criteria that a third-country national seasonal worker and his/her employer must fulfil. as the admission is demand-driven, a work contract or a binding job offer must be presented. they should specify a level of remuneration in order to allow the competent authorities to assess whether the proposed remuneration is comparable to that paid for the respective activity in the member state concerned. this is vital in order to avoid an unfair advantage for the employer and exploitative working conditions for the seasonal worker. the work contract must also specify the working hours per week or month. ensure that employers only request third-country seasonal workers in case of real economic need (sufficient employment capacities); serve as a guarantee of a certain, fixed level of remuneration for the seasonal workers, and, when applicable, other relevant working conditions such as insurances; enable efficient control by the competent authorities before admission. the application must also include evidence that the respective seasonal worker will benefit from appropriate accommodation. grounds for refusal : the proposal does not create a right to admission. these provisions lay down the mandatory and possible grounds for refusal as well as for withdrawal and non-renewal, including non-fulfilment of the admission criteria, the existence of quotas and the possibility for member states to carry out a labour market test. the principle of eu preference, as expressed in the relevant provisions of the acts of accession of 2003 and 2005, constitutes eu primary law, and therefore the directive must be applied in conformity with the acts of accession by those member states that still make use of the transitional arrangements. chapter iii: procedure and permit access to information : member states are required to ensure that the relevant information about conditions of entry and residence, including the rights granted to third-country seasonal workers, and about all the documentary evidence necessary for lodging the application are available to prospective third-country seasonal workers and their employers. applications : member states have to determine whether applications are to be lodged by the third-country national or by his or her prospective employer. they are also required to designate a competent authority to receive the application and issue the permit. this designation is without prejudice to the role and responsibilities of other national authorities with regard to the examination of and decision on the application. furthermore, the designation to receive and issue the permit should not prevent member states from appointing other authorities with which the third-country national or his/her prospective employer can lodge the application (e.g. consular offices) and which have the authority to issue the permit. the application to reside and work as a seasonal worker must be submitted in a single application procedure. seasonal worker permit : third-country nationals for whom a positive decision has been taken by the member state concerned must receive a seasonal worker permit. the residence permit with the indication ‘seasonal worker’ must allow both the residence and the exercise of the specific seasonal work authorised, without an additional permit, in particular a work permit, being necessary. accordingly, for periods of stay below three months, member states must issue a visa that will also entitle the seasonal worker to exercise the specific employment activity for which he/she was admitted. duration of stay : the maximum period of stay is set at six months in any calendar year. such strict limitation of the duration of stay should contribute to ensuring that third-country national workers admitted under the directive are actually employed for work that is genuinely seasonal and not for regular work. explicit provision is made that within the maximum duration of stay an extension of the contract or a change of employer for seasonal work is possible. this is important because seasonal workers who are tied to a single employer may face the risk of abuse. also, the possibility of extending the stay within the specified period of time may reduce the risk of overstaying. facilitation of re-entry : this provision is intended to promote circular migration of third-country national seasonal workers, that is, their movement between a third country and the eu for temporary stay and work in the latter. this kind of migration will potentially benefit the country of origin, the eu host country and the seasonal worker him/herself. accordingly, member states have the choice of either issuing multi-seasonal permits or applying a facilitated procedure. multi-seasonal permits cover up to three seasons and are thus appropriate for sectors where the labour market needs remain stable over a period of time. a third-country national who did not comply with the obligations linked to a previous stay as a seasonal worker is to be excluded from admission as a seasonal worker for one or more years. sanctions : an employer who has not fulfilled obligations resulting from the work contract must be subjected to sanctions and excluded from the possibility to apply for seasonal workers for at least one year. procedure : a fast-track procedure (30 days) is provided for examining applications. procedural guarantees include the possibility of a legal challenge against a decision rejecting an application as well as the requirement for the authorities to give reasons for such decision. accommodation: employers of seasonal workers must provide evidence that the seasonal worker will have accommodation ensuring an adequate standard of living. this covers cases where the employer is to provide accommodation and where accommodation is to be provided by a third party. chapter iv: rights rights : a seasonal worker permit entitles its holder to enter and reside on the territory of the member state which has issued the permit and to exercise the employment activity authorised by the permit. the text defines the working conditions, including pay, dismissal and health and safety requirements at the workplace applicable to seasonal workers in order to ensure legal certainty. it also grants rights to third-country seasonal workers by determining fields where equal treatment with own nationals should be ensured in the form of a minimum requirement without prejudice to the right of member states to adopt or maintain provisions which are more favourable. accordingly, equal treatment applies in respect of freedom of association and affiliation and membership of an organisation representing workers. equal treatment : equal treatment also applies to social security and covers the benefits defined in regulation (ec) no 883/04 on the coordination of social security systems. such provisions are intended to establish common rules within the eu; to recognise that third-country national seasonal workers legally working in a member state contribute to the european economy through their tax payments; and to serve as a safeguard to reduce unfair competition between own nationals and third-country nationals that may result from possible exploitation of the latter. complaints: complaints mechanisms should be put in place, open not only to third-country seasonal workers, but also to designated third parties. evidence suggests that seasonal workers are often either not aware of the existence of such mechanisms or they are hesitant to use them in their own name, as they are afraid of the consequences in terms of future employment possibilities. chapter v: final provisions : this chapter regulates the obligations of member states concerning sharing the relevant statistical data and the information resulting from transposition of the directive. it also

· ensure that in accordance with article 77 (2) (a) of the tfeu, the regulation determines exhaustively whether a third-country national is to be subject to, or exempt from, the visa requirement. as a result, a new amended version of regulation (ec) no 539/2001 is proposed to add a certain number of states to the positive or negative list of the regulation. impact assessment: no impact assessment has been carried out. legal base: article 77, par. 2, point a) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: in line with the approach taken within the framework of previous amendments to regulation (ec) no 539/2001, it is proposed to: · transfer some countries onto the positive list : t he imposition of the visa requirement on the nationals of dominica, grenada, kiribati , marshall islands, micronesia, nauru, palau, saint lucia, saint vincent and the grenadines, samoa, solomon islands, timor-leste, tonga, trinidad and tobago, tuvalu and vanuatu is no longer justified. these countries do not present any risk of illegal immigration or a threat to public policy for the union in accordance with the criteria set out in recital 5 of regulation (ec) n° 539/2001. consequently, nationals of those countries should be exempt from the visa requirement for stays of no more than three months in all and references to those countries should be transferred to annex ii. exemption from the visa requirement should not come into force until bilateral agreements on visa waiver between the union and the countries concerned have been concluded in order to ensure full reciprocity. · transfer the groups of “ british nationals ” onto the positive list : statistical data show that the groups of british nationals currently listed in point 3 of annex i do not pose a risk in terms of irregular migration to the schengen area and that most of them live in islands of the caribbean region which have strong links and similarities with neighbouring countries which are exempt from the visa obligation. these groups of british nationals should therefore be exempt from the visa requirement for stays of no more than three months in all and references to those groups should be transferred to annex ii. · update the negative list (annex i) by the inclusion of south sudan: on 9 july 2011, south sudan declared its independence from sudan, which is on the negative list. on 14 july 2011, the country was granted membership of the united nations. annex i should therefore be amended so as to include south sudan. budgetary implications: the proposed amendment has no implications for the union budget."

asylum; irregular migration and return), security (prevention of and fight against terrorism and organised crime; police cooperation) and management of the external borders (including visa policy), as well as the external dimension of these policies. the commission adopted a proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the europe 2020 strategy. in the area of home affairs policies, covering security, migration and the management of external borders, the commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two pillar structure: an asylum and migration fund and an internal security fund. this regulation establishes the asylum and migration fund which draws on the capacity building process developed with the assistance of the european refugee fund4, the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals5 and the european return fund and extends it to cover more comprehensively different aspects of the common union asylum and immigration policy. recent events at the greek/turkish border and in the southern mediterranean have also demonstrated how important it is for the union to have a comprehensive approach to migration, covering various aspects such as: strengthened border management and schengen governance, better targeted legal migration, enhanced dissemination of best practices on integration, a reinforced common european asylum system, and a more strategic approach to relations with third countries on migration. impact assessment: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. it was completed in july 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. on the basis of this study, the commission drafted an impact assessment report. the main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. in the area of asylum and migration, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the stockholm programme and its action plan. there was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. legal basis: articles 78(2) and 79(2) and (4) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). content: the proposed regulation establishes for the period from 1 january 2014 to 31 december 2020 the asylum and migration fund. general objective : the general objective of the fund shall be to contribute to an effective management of migration flows in the union as part of the area of freedom, security and justice, in accordance with the common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection and the common immigration policy. specific objectives : within its general objective, the fund shall contribute to the following specific objectives: to strengthen and develop the common european asylum system, including its external dimension; to support legal migration to the union in line with the economic and social needs of member states and promote the effective integration of third-country nationals, including of asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection; to enhance fair and effective return strategies in the member states with emphasis on sustainability of return and effective readmission in the countries of origin; to enhance the solidarity and responsibility sharing between the member states, in particular towards those most affected by migration and asylum flows. for each of these objectives, key indicators are defined. actions in or in relation to third countries : the fund shall support actions catering primarily for union interests, having a direct impact in the union and its member states and ensuring a necessary continuity with activities implemented in the territory of the union. actions that are directly development oriented shall not be supported through this fund. in implementing such actions, full coherence will be sought with the principles and general objectives of the union external action related to the country or region in question. implementation : the specific implementing measures are laid down in a separate regulation (horizontal regulation). resources for member states : t he most important part of the resources available under the fund will be channelled through national programmes of member states covering the whole period 2014-2020. for this purpose, the amount of resources to be allocated to the member states within the fund will be composed of a basic amount and a variable amount. following a mid-term review an additional amount may be allocated as of budget year 2018. (1) basic amount : the b asic amount is established on the basis of latest available statistical data relating to the migration flows, such as the number of first asylum applications, positive decisions granting refugee or subsidiary protection, number of resettled refugees, stock and flows of legally residing third-country nationals, number of return decisions issued by the national authorities and the number of effected returns. those data are the same as those used so far for the calculation of allocations under the european refugee fund, the european fund for the integration of third-country nationals and the european return fund. in order to ensure critical mass for the implementation of national programmes, eur 5 million is added as a minimum amount to each member state. the basic amounts earmarked to individual member states will serve as a basis to start the policy dialogue , followed by the multiannual programming, to support, on the hand, a limited number of compulsory objectives (e.g. strengthening the establishment of common european asylum system by ensuring the efficient and uniform application of the union acquis on asylum or developing an assisted voluntary return programme including a component on reintegration) and, on the other hand, to address the specific needs of each member state. (2) variable amount : the variable amount will be allocated following the policy dialogue mentioned above to those member states willing to work in those operational fields which depend on their political commitment and willingness to act, or ability to cooperate with other member states. this will be the case for the implementation of specific actions such as for: instance joint processing of asylum applications, joint return operations, setting up of joint migration centres, the implementation of resettlement and relocation operations. as regards resettlement : member states will receive financial incentives (lump sums) every two years on the basis of their pledging which will follow the establishment of common union resettlement priorities. these will be the result of a political process involving in particular the european parliament and the council and reflecting the policy developments at national and union level. through these financial incentives, two objectives are to be achieved: a quantitative one, i.e. to increase significantly the current resettlement figures which are too small, and a qualitative one, i.e. to strengthen the european dimension through the implementation of defined and dynamic common union resettlement priorities. moreover, based on a similar pledging exercise and at regular intervals, member states will receive financial incentives (lump sums) for relocation of beneficiaries of international protection. mid-term allocation : a part of available resources will be kept for mid-term review. this will, on the one hand, allow allocating additional amounts to those member states undergoing significant changes in migration flows and presenting specific needs concerning their asylum and reception systems and, on the other hand, to allocate additional amounts to those member states willing to implement specific actions. the latter may be revised in line with the most recent policy developments. union agencies : to use more effectively the competence and expertise of relevant union agencies in the home affairs field, the commission also envisages to make use of the possibility offered by the financial regulation to entrust, within the resources available under this regulation, the implementation of specific tasks to such agencies, in the framework of their missions and in complementarity with their work programmes. for the tasks covered by this regulation this concerns in particular the european asylum support office (easo) and the european agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the european union (frontex agency) for activities in and outside the eu requiring operational expertise on issues related to asylum and irregular immigration, respectively. delegated acts: in order to supplement or amend provisions of this regulation on the lump sums for resettlement and relocation, the definition of specific actions and of common union resettlement priorities, the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission. the commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and council. budgetary implication : the commission's proposal for a multi-annual financial framework includes a proposal of eur 3 869 million (in current prices) for asylum and migration fund for the period 2014-2020. indicatively more than 80% of this amount (eur 3 232 million) should be used for national programmes of member states while eur 637 million should be centrally managed by the commission to fund union actions, emergency assistance, european migration network, technical assistance and the implementation of specific operational tasks by union agencies."

to lay down the general provisions on the asylum and migration fund and on the instrument for financial support for police cooperation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management., in the framework of the horizontal regulation for implementation. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: home affairs policies have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. these policies are at the heart of the european project to create an area without internal borders where eu citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. the commission adopted a proposal for the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020: a budget for delivering the europe 2020 strategy. the commission proposed to simplify the structure of the expenditure instruments by reducing the number of programmes to a two-fund structure: an asylum and migration fund and an internal security fund. experience suggests that in the current programming period, the diversity and fragmentation of rules governing spending programmes are often perceived as unnecessarily complicated and difficult to implement and control. this imposes a heavy administrative burden on beneficiaries as well as on the commission and member states, which can have the unintended effect of discouraging participation, increasing error rates and delaying implementation. this means that the potential benefits of union programmes are not fully realised. this regulation is part of a package of four regulations, jointly establishing the framework for union funding on home affairs under the two funds. this regulation lays down rules on programming, management and control, financial management, clearance of accounts, closure of programmes and reporting and evaluation. thus, it sets out the delivery mechanisms whereas the purpose and scope of the two funds, the resources and means of implementation are defined in their respective specific regulations. this horizontal instrument will ensure a common approach to the implementation of the two funds and a uniform treatment of beneficiaries in relation to all union support in the area of home affairs. impact assessment: i accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. the impact assessment identified problems in relation to the scope and priorities of the current home affairs spending programmes on the one hand and the problems regarding the delivery of funding on the other hand. in relation to the latter, the impact assessment examined options in relation to shared management, centralised management and the timely response to emergency situations. in relation to shared management , the impact assessment concluded that a multiannual programme preceded by a policy dialogue was the preferred option. contrary to the status quo, which combines annual programmes within a multiannual framework, it would significantly reduce administrative workload. in terms of improving the delivery of funding under centralised management , the status quo was discarded because it offers little or no prospect of simplification or reduction of administrative workload. recourse to a more targeted, less resource-intensive and diversified centralised management is the preferred option because it is expected to improve relations with key stakeholders and to lead to an overall reduction in workload. in relation to the emergency response mechanism , the impact assessment concluded that the current mechanism clearly does not meet the need for a quicker and more effective response to crises in the areas of migration and security. an improved mechanism extended to both a wider range of migration-related crises and security-related crises was considered the preferred option. stakeholders supported the idea of reducing the number of financial instruments to a two-fund structure on the condition that this would actually lead to simplification. they also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism to allow the union to respond quickly and effectively to migration and security-related crises. shared management with a move to multi-annual programming with the definition of common targets at union level was generally seen as the appropriate management method for all home affairs spending although non-governmental organisations were of the view that direct management should also be continued . legal basis: articles 78(2), 79(2), 79(4), 82(1), 84 and 87(2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). in light of this legal basis, the provisions of this regulation lay down horizontal common provisions for the implementation of the asylum and migration fund and one component of the internal security fund, namely the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management. content: this regulation lays down obligations only of a financial and technical nature and leaves the choices on the definition of policy objectives, eligible actions, the allocation of resources and the scope of the intervention for each specific policy area to the respective legal basis (i.e. in the specific regulations). as a new general framework for implementing union funding in the area of home affairs policies, this regulation sets outs general rules on the financing of expenditure including rules on partnership, programming, reporting, monitoring and evaluation, the management and control systems to be put in place by the member states and the clearance of accounts. general principles : the proposed regulation seeks to lay down the conditions for: a more policy-driven and results-oriented funding, including through reinforced strategic programming; a significant simplification of the delivery mechanisms compared to the current situation; more flexibility in financial management and in the implementation, in light of the need to be able to address new and unforeseen circumstances typical of home affairs; an enhanced monitoring and evaluation framework, ensuring accountability, transparency and informed reflection on future support in the area of home affairs. the main principles are detailed as follows: (1) a policy-driven and results-oriented agenda (a) for shared management : at the beginning of the next multiannual financial framework, there will be a single, overarching home affairs policy dialogue with each member state on their use of the funds. taking into account the outcome of the policy dialogue, the programmes agreed between the commission and the member state will describe the baseline situation and lay down the objectives member states are to achieve in the policy area and the objectives for the use of union funding. the national programme will identify targets and examples of actions per objective. in addition, a seven-year financial plan will indicate how the allocated resources are to be committed and spent, within the ceilings available. in case of actions to be implemented in and in relation to third countries, such actions should not be directly development-oriented and the policy dialogue should seek full coherence with the principles and general objectives of the union external action and foreign policy related to the country or region in question. it is also provides that: member states will report annually on financial management and the results achieved under the programmes; there will be a mid-term review in 2017 to re-examine the situation in each member state. at this occasion, new resources can be allocated for the period 2018-2020. (b) for direct and indirect management : the objectives to be achieved under the national programmes will be complemented by ""union actions"" as well as a rapid response mechanism to deal with emergency situations. union actions will support the implementation of union policies through grants and procurement. they will include actions in and in relation to third countries as indicated in the communication on the multiannual financial framework. such actions shall not be directly development oriented and shall complement, as appropriate, the financial assistance provided through the eu's external aid instruments. union actions and emergency assistance measures may also be carried out by union agencies in the area of home affairs (cepol, europol, easo, frontex and the it agency). technical assistance at the initiative of the commission will be used to support member states and beneficiaries, to encourage mutual learning and improve communication (including corporate communication where appropriate) and evaluation. these appropriations will also support adequate control measures in the union and in third countries relating to actions funded. (2) simplification of delivery mechanisms (a) for shared management : each member state will be required to have a single national programme per fund, thus bringing together various policy areas. the new framework represents a major simplification and reduction of administrative burden compared to the current four funds, which work with both a multiannual strategy and annual programmes. a low number of revisions of national programmes are expected (there should be, per member state and per fund, one decision to approve the multiannual programme and, if needed, one decision to revise the programme in the context of the mid-term review); each member states will set up a single management and control system per fund, with the possibility of having one system to cover both funds; the eligibility of expenditure shall be determined on the basis of national rules, subject to a limited number of common, simple principles (simplified cost options such as flat rates and lump sums in particular). (b) for direct and indirect management : - in the event of emergency situations: the mechanism shall be triggered by the commission, also following the initiative of member states, the article 71 committee (cosi) represented by the respective union presidency or other stakeholders such as international organisations, etc; all possible means will be used to avoid fragmentation by concentrating resources on a limited number of union objectives; - for the financial support to the development of new it systems (""the smart borders package""), the current annual financial decisions enabling the commission to develop the central parts will be replaced by a multiannual framework. (3) flexibility (a) for shared management : the impact of the mid-term review will depend on the situation in the member states. member states which are deemed to have additional risks or which obtain additional resources to implement union specific priorities would be invited to revise the amounts in their financial plan and where appropriate to add elements in their programme. financial flexibility will be implemented notably through the different mechanisms provided by these proposals, bearing in mind as central phases for their implementation the multiannual financial programming and its annual update, the annual budget allocation and the annual budget implementation. (b) for direct and indirect management : annual appropriations for union actions, emergency assistance and, subject to annual ceilings, the technical assistance at the initiative of the commission, are considered as one ""envelope"", thereby allowing maximum flexibility to decide from one financial year to another where the resources will be allocated, depending on the specific needs. the specific regulations foresee implementation in relation to all the policies and objectives supported by the funds and even financing policy-related aspects of the operation of the funds. (4) a coherent and efficient reporting, monitoring and evaluation framework (a) for shared management : member states will report annually on the implementation of the multiannual programme, as an integral part of the clearance of accounts' exercise. to feed into the mid term review process, they will be requested in 2017 to provide additional information on the progress made in achieving the objectives. a similar exercise will be undertaken in 2019, to allow, where appropriate, adjustments during the last financial year (2020). supporting the development of a evaluation-based culture in the area of home affairs, the funds will have a common evaluation and monitoring framework with broad policy related indicators which underline the result-oriented approach to the funds and the essential role they could play in the policy mix to achieve the objectives towards an area of freedom, security and justice. all measures will be established at the beginning of the programming period, thus enabling member states to set up their reporting and evaluation systems on the basis of the agreed principles and requirements. to reduce the administrative burden and ensure synergies between reporting and evaluation, the information required for evaluation reports will build on and complete the information provided by member states in the annual implementation reports of the national programmes. the interim evaluation report is due in 2018 and should feed into the reflection on the subsequent programming period. delegated acts: in order to amend provisions of this regulation on the common principles on the eligibility of expenditure, the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission. the commission, when preparing and drawing up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and to the council. budgetary implication : this proposal has no implications for the eu budget."

to establish, as part of the internal security fund, the instrument for financial support for external borders and visa. this fund will take over from the external borders fund 2007-2013 which shall be repealed with effect from 1 january 2014. proposed act: regulation of the european parliament and of the council. background: the policies related to the area of freedom, security and justice have been steadily growing in importance over the last years. these policies are at the heart of the european project to create an area without internal borders where union citizens and third-country nationals may enter, circulate, live and work. in the field of internal security, key documents such as the commission's communication on the internal security strategy have provided clear guidance on the direction of activities in the years to come. for border management and visa policy, the communication on migration outlined in more detail the challenges ahead in relation to border security and the development of an area without internal borders. the communication on the schengen governance presented proposals to strengthen the schengen acquis by means of a governance system capable of responding effectively, and in a timely and coordinated union-wide way, to exceptional circumstances and challenges which might put the overall functioning of schengen at stake. the communication on smart borders – options and the way ahead outlines how new it systems such as an entry/exit system and a registered traveller programme can contribute to a better management of migration flows in the union. a key component in the common integrated border management system has been the development of union solidarity mechanisms, supporting a uniform and high-quality application of the union standards on border management and the common visa policy. enhancing the coordination of operational co-operation by the member states on border control through the frontex agency constitutes an important step towards the development of the system. moreover, with the external borders fund, the union expresses solidarity through financial assistance to those member states that apply the schengen provisions on external borders and visa. it is against this background that the commission, in its proposal on the next multi-annual financial framework for the period 2014-2020, suggested to set up an internal security fund, as part of a simplified two-fund structure for future expenditure in the home affairs area which also includes the creation of an asylum and migration fund. impact assessment: in accordance with the greater emphasis placed on evaluation as a tool to inform policy making, this proposal is informed by evaluation results, stakeholder consultation and impact assessment. work on the preparation of the future financial instruments for home affairs started in 2010 and continued into 2011. it was completed in july 2011 and brought together available evaluation results for the existing financial instruments and informed the problems, objectives and policy options, including their likely impact, examined in the impact assessment. on the basis of this study, the commission drafted an impact assessment report. the main conclusion may be summarised as follows: to broaden the scope of action for union funding in the field of asylum and migration, including as regards its external dimension, to work towards more simplification of delivery mechanisms and greater flexibility, notably to respond to emergencies. in the area of internal security, stakeholders considered that the broad thematic priorities have already been fixed by the 2009 stockholm programme and the 2010 internal security strategy. a future funding mechanism should therefore be defined comprehensively, comprising law enforcement, border guards and customs communities. the need to make greater use of relevant union agencies, such as europol and frontex was also considered important. there was broad support to reduce the number of financial instruments to a two-fund structure on the condition that this leads to simplification. stakeholders also agreed on the need for a flexible emergency response mechanism. legal basis: article 77 (2) of the treaty on the functioning of the european union (tfeu). the creation of the internal security fund requires the adoption of two legislative instruments which jointly constitute the fund. this overall structure was chosen in light of the treaty obligations. it is not legally possible to draw up one single comprehensive legislative proposal for an internal security fund, despite the coherence of the policy objectives to be addressed. the internal security fund is therefore created as a comprehensive financial framework which is composed of two separate acts, setting up the different components of the fund and laying down the objectives, the eligible actions and the envelopes of each component: - a regulation setting up, as part of the fund, the component for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management; - this regulation setting up, as part of the fund, the border management and common visa policy component. content: with this proposal, the commission proposes to establish the instrument for financial support for the management of external borders and the common visa policy as part of the internal security fund. jointly with the future regulation establishing as part of the internal security fund, the instrument for financial support for police co-operation, preventing and combating crime, and crisis management, this regulation establishes for the period from 1 january 2014 to 31 december 2020 the internal security fund. main objectives : the general objective of the instrument shall be to contribute to ensuring a high level of security in the european union. within the general objective, the instrument shall contribute - in line with the priorities identified in relevant eu strategies, programmes, threat and risk assessments - to the following specific objectives: supporting a common visa policy to facilitate legitimate travel, ensure equal treatment of third country nationals and tackle irregular migration; supporting borders management , to ensure, on one hand, a high level of protection of external borders and, on the other hand, the smooth crossing of the external borders in conformity with the schengen acquis. to achieve these objectives, the instrument shall contribute to the following operational objectives: support and reinforce the national capabilities in the area of border control and visa policy and thus expressing financial solidarity with the tasks entrusted to individual member states at external borders and in consulates in the interest of the border-free area as a public service provided to the union (national programmes, including ""operating support""); finance the development of the smart border package , i.e. the setting up of an eu entry exit system (ees) and an eu registered traveller programme (rtp); finance the introduction and operation of the european border surveillance system, eurosur , notably through the purchase of equipment, infrastructure and systems in member states; reinforce the schengen governance and the evaluation and monitoring mechanism to verify the application of the schengen acquis by (a) funding the operation of that mechanism under direct management; (b) introducing conditionalities based on compliance with the schengen acquis for the disbursement of operating support to member states and (c) requiring member states to (re)allocate resources received for programmes under this instrument with priority to remedy weaknesses if these have been identified under the mechanism; boost the operational potential of the frontex agency by inviting member states to earmark additional resources under their programmes for specialised equipment which can be put at the disposal of the agency for its joint operations; support the development and implementation of the relevant union policies in the eu, in and with third countries under ""union actions"", thus improving the overall management of migration flows to the union (projects managed either directly, such as studies or pilot projects to reinforce co-operation with third countries, or indirectly, in accordance with the financial regulation; have readily available adequate resources to provide emergency assistance in case of situations of urgent or exceptional migratory pressure; continue support for the functioning of the specific transit scheme for lithuania , in accordance with the obligations of the eu10, providing support to compensate for foregone fees from transit visas and additional costs incurred by lithuania in implementing the facilitated transit document (ftd) and facilitated rail transit document (frtd) scheme, such as replacing and upgrading equipment, it systems, training and operational costs. for each of these objectives, key indicators are defined. it should be noted that actions related to the temporary and exceptional reintroduction of border control at internal borders as referred to in the schengen borders code are not eligible. implementation : the commission envisages to give the implementation tasks of this programme to the agency for the operational management of large-scale it-systems in the area of freedom, security and justice (it agency). this regulation would in this case be amended at the appropriate time to include the tasks specifically in the mission of the agency. allocation of funds : in view of the above, the allocation of funding under shared management is based on a combination of: a basic amount allocated to the member states at the start of the next multi-annual financial framework (mff); a flexible amount to be added to the basic amount, allocated in two phases. (1) the basic amount is allocated to the member states at the start of the next mff and calculated on the basis of objective criteria and needs. it is 60% of the overall envelope for national programmes and the allocations are laid down per member state in annex i of this regulation. they are based on the 2010-2012 calculations under the external borders fund, whilst incorporating a minimum amount for each member state. this will ensure some continuity with the current mff and give the member states financial stability to plan their national multiannual programmes. (2) the flexible amount will be added to the basic amount depending on the willingness of each member state to finance under its national programme actions that respond to specific union priorities. these specific actions are defined in annex ii and can be amended. in principle, it would be allocated in two phases: at the start of the mff, as part of the policy dialogue and negotiations on the national programmes of the relevant member states, and during a mid-term review in 2017. this mid-term review would be the occasion to re-examine the situation in member states and to allocate new resources for the remaining years of the mff (2018-2020). mid-term review : this mid-term review would be the occasion to re-examine the situation in member states and to allocate new resources for the remaining years of the mff (2018-2020). these risk/needs assessments could be produced with the help of the frontex agency. member states who, on the basis of these assessments, have more needs or face increased risks will receive an additional amount, thereby giving tangible expression to the principle of solidarity and responsibility-sharing. union agencies : to use more effectively the competences and expertise of relevant union agencies in the home affairs field, the commission also envisages to make use of the possibility offered by the financial regulation to entrust, with the resources available under this regulation, the implementation of specific tasks to such agencies, in the framework of their missions and in complementarity to their work programmes. for the tasks covered under this instrument this concerns in particular: (i) the european agency for the management of operational cooperation at the external borders of the member states of the european union (frontex agency), for activities in and outside the union requiring operational expertise on border control;(ii) the european asylum support office (easo), for activities such as training on asylum addressed to border guards; (iii) the european police office (europol) and the european police college (cepol) in the light of interagency co-operation of law enforcement authorites with border guards; (iv) the agency for the operational management of large-scale it-systems in the area of freedom security and justice (it agency) insofar as the development of new it systems is concerned. budgetary implication : the commission's proposal for the next multi-annual framework includes a proposal of eur 4 648 million (in current prices) for the internal security fund for the period 2014-2020. within this global envelope, the resources available for the implementation of this specific regulation amount to eur 3,520 million. indicatively: about 61% of this amount (eur 2 150 million) should be used for national programmes of member states and the support to the special transit scheme implemented by lithuania; 31% (eur 1 100 million) should be dedicated to the development of the smart border package and the remainder should then be available to fund union actions, emergency actions and technical assistance, whilst taking into account also the contributions expected from the schengen associated countries, which would be added to the total envelope. moreover, outside the scope of the internal security fund, a separate envelope of eur 822 million (current prices) is set aside for the management of existing large scale-it systems (schengen information system ii, visa information system and eurodac). the management of these systems will gradually be transferred from the commission to the future agency for the operational management of large-scale it-systems in the area of freedom security and justice (it agency) after it begins operations in late 2012. delegated acts: in order to supplement or amend provisions in this instrument regarding the definition of specific actions under the national programmes the power to adopt acts in accordance with article 290 of the treaty on the functioning of the european union should be delegated to the commission. the commission, when preparing and drawing-up delegated acts, should ensure a simultaneous, timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the european parliament and council."
